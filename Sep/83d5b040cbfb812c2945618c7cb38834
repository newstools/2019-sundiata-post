D’banj has welcomed a son with his wife, Lineo Didi Kilgrow in the United States of America barely a month after revealing that he’s expecting a child.

In August 2019 during an interview with On-Air Personality, Shopsy of Beat FM London, D’banj announced that he’s expecting another son when he was asked about how he coped with the difficulty of losing a child. The Koko master said he never thought about losing a child, saying it’s not a thing anyone should wish their worst enemy. Source
