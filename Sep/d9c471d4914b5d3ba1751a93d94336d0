Aisha Ahmed Kano â€“ The Kano State Ministry of Health, has cautioned residents on the misuse of mosquito treated nets distributed to them under its National Malaria Elimination Programme. The Director of Public Health of the ministry, Dr Imam Wada, gave this caution in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kano on Monday. He decried a situation whereby many residents would not listen or comply to the rules and regulations attached to the use of the mosquito treated nets before collecting them. Wada frowned at a situation where some users deliberately diverted the nets to different purposes after receiving it, an action, he said, usually triggered a lot of undesirable consequences. According to him, the ministry embarks on mobilisation and enlightenment while the workers issuing the nets also take time to explain how the nets should be used, yet people fail to comply. The director explained that the nets should be spread outside for two hours for fresh air to reduce the effect of the insecticides applied to it. He advised the beneficiaries to stop using the net as curtains, but rather utilize it as demonstrated either through the enlightenment or as directed by the workers. NAN reports that the state government embarked on house to house registration for free mosquito treated nets, where residents were also enlightened on how to use them. The nets are being distributed free under the National Malaria Elimination Programme with support from Society for Family Health.
