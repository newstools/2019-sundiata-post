By Victor OkoyeAbuja –  Commonwealth champion Odunayo Adekuoroye on Thursday won a bronze medal at the ongoing 2019 Senior World Wrestling Championships in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, her third medal in the history of the competition. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Adekuoroye’s victory is coming a day after she sealed her place at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. After losing in the semi-finals to the eventual champion Risako Kawai of Japan, the World number 3 in the 57kg category outclassed Moldova’s Anastasia Nichita 10-0 via technical superiority in the bronze medal match. She thus added another medal to the bronze and silver medals she won in the competition in 2015 (USA) and 2017 (France), respectively. “As you can see, we (Nigeria) came here with five girls and a male, who hasn’t got any medal, so it was like I really need to make my country proud,” the 25-year-old told United World Wrestling after her victory. Adekuoroye added: “I am so very happy because everyone is my fan and they have been wishing me well even before I qualified. “So I am so very glad that I did not put them to shame. I’m happy. “For my coach Akuh Purity, I know he is proud of me now, and I am so very proud of him for training me.” (NAN)
