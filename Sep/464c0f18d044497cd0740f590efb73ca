By Nathan Nwakamma Yenagoa – The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) on Wednesday inaugurated a special unit, Agro Rangers Unit, to check clashes between farmers and herdsmen in Bayelsa. Mr Philip Ayuba, the Commandant of the corps in the state, who inaugurated the unit in Yenagoa, said it was part of the NSCDC’s response to frequent clashes between farmers and herders. Ayuba noted that such clashes had resulted in killings and wanton destruction of lives and property. He said the newly-created unit would ensure adequate security of agricultural investments such as farmlands, silos, ranches, livestock and processing industries in the state. The commandant advised personnel of the unit to be professional in the discharge of their duties. Also speaking, Dr Boma Spero-Jack, Special Adviser to Gov. Seriake Dickson on Security, lauded the NSCDC for launching the unit and described it as timely. Spero-Jack said that the measure would encourage investments in agriculture, thereby boosting food security, rapid growth and development.
