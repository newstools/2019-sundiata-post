Beirut – The National News Agency reported on Thursday that the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon demonstrated outside the Canadian embassy demanding asylum in Canada. “All what we are asking for is a humanitarian asylum to be able to live with dignity because we are deprived from all our civil and humanitarian rights in Lebanon.’’Palestinian refugees said. Lebanon’s Labor Ministry has lately taken measures to bind Palestinian refugees to issue a work permit to be able to work in Lebanon, which sparked anger among Palestinian refugees. Palestinian refugees have been demanding for their rights to work in all sectors in Lebanon without any exceptions or limitations. According to a study by the Lebanese Palestinian Dialogue Committee in 2017, there were 174,422 registered Palestinians in Lebanon.
