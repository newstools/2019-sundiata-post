A Nigerian Lady has taken to Twitter to show off the things she bought from the market with just one thousand five hundred naira. The woman with the handle @Buttergirlll while sharing the post, wrote: “Just came back from the market and everything in this tray cost me less than 1500 Naira, out of the the N1500 sef, I removed T-fare and bought yogurt in the market. If you argue with me, then you are not a wife/husband material”. Source
