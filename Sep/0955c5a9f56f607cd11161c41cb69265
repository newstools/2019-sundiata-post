Oslo – Authorities in Norway are scrambling to track down the cause a mystery disease that has killed over 25 dogs in a day, across the country. Dog owners and veterinarians are stumped and concerned by the mystery disease. Around 100 dogs have been diagnosed with symptoms that include general weakness, vomiting and bloody diarrhoea in recent weeks. Dog owners have been urged to prevent their four-legged companions from coming into close contact with other dogs. Several dog shows and dog-related events have been cancelled. So far, veterinarians have only been able to establish that a healthy  animal can quickly succumb, to the desease within 24 hours. The Norwegian Veterinary Institute  spokesman, Asle Haukaas said on Tuesday that most could recover if treated in time. Initial autopsies suggest that all the deceased dogs had suffered from a severe bowel inflammation. Two strains of bacteria have so far been detected: Providencia alcalifaciens and Clostridium perfringens. Authorities have been able to rule out poisoning and infections due to salmonella or Campylobacter bacteria. The Norwegian Kennel Club estimates there are around 560,000 dogs in Norway. (dpa/NAN)
