Abuja – Seyi has employed a trick after being dared by his fellow housemates to sleep on Tacha’s bed. BBNaija housemate, Seyi Awolowo has won 1000 BetNaija coins after being dared by his fellow housemates, Frodd and Omashola to sleep on Tacha’s bed. Recall that Seyi and Tacha don’t see eye-to-eye in the house after falling out. It happened that after the Saturday Night party, Seyi was seen in the dressing room area with Frodd and Omashola. Seyi told them that he was going to sleep on Tacha’s bed. The two guys who were surprised, dared Seyi to spend an hour on Tacha’s for 1000 BetNaija coin. Seyi then went stylishly to her bed and Tacha, who was surprised laughed out loud and left the bed. @HOMARELLL wrote; “The moment Seyi told Omashola Frodd x later mike that he was going to sleep in TACHA’s bed #bbnaija (bet was placed)” Watch video below: Seyi was dared by Frodd and Omashola to spend 1hr on Tacha's bed for bed for 1000 bet naija coin. #BBNaijia pic.twitter.com/EoLENdctpV Source
