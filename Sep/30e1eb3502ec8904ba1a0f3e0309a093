By Don Silas Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Former Governor of Ekiti State, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, has called on Governor Kayode Fayemi to do what he could not do for the workers in the state civil service by paying them their arrears of unpaid salaries and emoluments. Fayose said this after Fayemi told labour leaders on Tuesday that the workers in the state civil service were currently being owed N57billion as arrears of unpaid salaries and emoluments. Fayose said this at a meeting he had with the civil servants as well as a cross-section of labour leaders at the Government House, Ado Ekiti. The Governor claimed the trend was caused by irregular payments of salaries and pensions by the immediate past administration of Mr Ayodele Fayose. Fayemi said, “It is
sad to reel out such a humongous figure because it can create panic for you and
I. ” But let me say that
we cannot pay everything in one fell swoop, but the 2019 promotion arrears will
be given immediate attention while others will be defrayed by instalment. ”It becomes difficult
to pay once because Ekiti gets a little above N5 Billion monthly, with the
state getting like N3 billion, while the local governments receive little above
N2 billion monthly,“ he said. But Fayose in a tweet
he shared on Tuesday night via @GovAyoFayose, said: “I read without surprise
& as usual @kfayemi usual brandishing of figures owed Ekiti workers &
retirees by my administration. “Without joining
issues with him, rather than public service announcement, I enjoin him to pay
the workers. Moreso he was “voted” for to do what I couldn’t do.”
