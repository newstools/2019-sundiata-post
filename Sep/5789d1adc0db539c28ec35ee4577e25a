Officer Brian Mulkeen, 33, and his partner were attempting to apprehend an unnamed suspect about 12:30 am near the Edenwald Houses on East 229th Street, police said. The suspect, at the time, had fled after he was confronted by three other officers who emerged from a patrol car to question him.  When Mulkeen and his partner intervened to pursue the suspect, a ‘violent struggle’ on the ground between the cop and suspect began, police said.

Sources said the officer was shot in the head, chest and legs, reports the New York Post.
