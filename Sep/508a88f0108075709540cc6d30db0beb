By David Adeoye Ibadan – Gov. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has approved the creation of a 250-truck capacity parking space in Ibadan to ensure free flow of human and vehicular movements within the state capital. Dr Akin Fagbemi, Chairman of Oyo State Traffic Management Agency (OYRTMA), made the disclosure on Monday when he visited the Ibadan toll gate, an area usually characterised by haphazard parking of heavy duty trucks. According to Fagbemi, the park, which is being sited at Sanyo area of the metropolis, will reduce the level of road carnage being caused by indiscriminate parking of haulage trucks on the highways. He stressed that the project was aimed at enthroning sanity on the road and discourage the disorderly and dangerous parking habit among motorists at the toll gate and other road corridors in the city. ”Vigilance by everyone is safety for all; negligence of anyone is danger for all. This is why the governor has approved the heavy and light duty vehicle park at Sanyo area in Ibadan. “The parking space can conveniently accommodate about 250 trailers and other small-sized vehicles at optimum capacity. ”It will significantly reduce the huge trailer traffic on our highways, ease traffic congestion and provide safety for the vehicles. “The ripple effect of this is that it will enhance economic activities, encourage foreign and local investors as well as boost the overall economy of the state,” Fagbemi said. The OYRTMA chairman assured all relevant stakeholders in the state that the agency was working round the clock to secure befitting parks in other strategic areas. (NAN)
