By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Minister of
Communications, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami has commended the Nigerian
Communictaion Commision for reducing the number of incomplete sim card
registration from 9.2million to 2.24million within the period of two weeks. He gave the commendation on Monday in
Abuja while inaugurating the newly appointed board members of the commission on
Monday. According to the Minister, “I have breaking
news for you. Last week I gave us details here that that the statistics of
unregistered/incomplete sim cards was alarming and worrisome. Report I got was
that we had 9.2million incomplete sim registration. I was flabbergasted. But
the report I got this morning is that it has been reduced to 2.42million.
Meaning that about 73.31% has been rectified by the NCC within two weeks. “This means we have only 2.24million
yet to be rectified. So we want them to be properly rectified on or before 25th
September, 2019”, the minister said. “Investigation reveals that 99% of
crimes committed in Nigeria, sim card is involved. Before you think of any economic
benefit, the constitution says that the primary responsibility of the executive
is the protection of life and property. So the life of one innocent Nigeria is
more important than any economic benefit the Federal Government may get from as
a result of improper registration of sim card because you can’t think of any
other benefit except when you are alive, the minister said. He therefore charged the NCC to ensure
that by 25th September 2019, there will be no single sim card with
incomplete registration so that when a crime is committed, the commission would
be able to trace it to somebody and give the details to law enforcement
agencies to trace the perpetrator.
