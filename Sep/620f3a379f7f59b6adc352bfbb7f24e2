Ibrahim Abdulazeez Iseyin (Oyo State) – Oke-Ogun Development Forum (ODF), a Non-Governmental Organisation, has donated over 3000 copies of exercise books and instructional materials to some selected schools in Oke-Ogun in Oyo North Senatorial District. Mr Abiodun Eegundiran, ODF Coordinator, told NAN on Tuesday that the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) was also involved in the process of distribution. He said the ODF was planning to pay school fees of about 50 students in Oke-Ogun by December, adding that it would continue to play important role in development of education in the council. Eegundiran said the exercise was part of their self-help project aimed at lifting the burden of parents and guardians and also a way to give back to the society. “We gather ourselves with the aim that we need to pay back to our communities the good it has given to us. It is a non-political and non-governmental initiative.” He, however, commended efforts of the state government in revamping the falling standard of education.
