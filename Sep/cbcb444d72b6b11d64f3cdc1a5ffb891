Abuja – Khafi and Tacha’s friendship has gone through several tests in the last three weeks and it’s beginning to cause a stir in the house. Three weeks after Khafi and Tacha’s friendship became noticeable to viewers, the BFFs are beginning to cause a stir in the house. After the BFFs bonded more in the Head of House room during Khafi’s democratic reign, the two have become targets for at least five housemates that are scheming to take their pound of flesh on them. From Mercy to Diane, Venita and Seyi, the name of the BFFs have remained constant in several conversations all through week 10. Though Tacha is known to keeping to herself in the house till the fourth week after her fake eviction and trip to the ‘Secret Room’, she couldn’t resist the bubbly energy that Khafi exudes and as such, the two have become buddies. Interestingly, the journey to their friendship didn’t kick off smooth as Khafi once had a misconception about the ankle bracelet Tacha wears but she later apologised to Tacha and they wiped the slate clean.
