He was also accused of participating in demonstrations in Ho Chi Minh City on June 10, 2018, protesting government’s special economic zone bill, which critics feared would allow China to establish territorial footholds in Vietnam. He was, however, fined 750,000 dong, or 32 dollars, for joining the protest.
