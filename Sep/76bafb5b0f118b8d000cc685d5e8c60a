•File photo: Passengers after attack on the highway By Nurudeen Alimi Three people were killed while some passengers were whisked away into the bush by suspected kidnappers on the Abuja-Lokoja Express road on Sunday evening. The suspected kidnappers waylaid a 14-seater bus fully loaded with passengers and was heading to Abuja before the unfortunate incident. It was at this point that another two Toyota Sienna mini buses also loaded with passengers and a Volvo SUV ran into the scene and all the occupants of the vehicles were taken into the bush. An eyewitness, a driver of a commercial bus who escaped the onslaught by whisker told the Nigerian Tribune that the three people that were killed failed to cooperate with the abductors. He further informed that that has been the usual practice particularly on Sunday, giving a hint that a colleague of his was kidnapped last week with an undisclosed amount of money was paid as ransom. Security operatives such as the Police, Army and the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps were on ground at the scene of the incident. (Nigerian Tribune)
