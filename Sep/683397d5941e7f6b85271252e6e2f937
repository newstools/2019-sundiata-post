Rivers – When the Jebe family of four were leaving their house recently for an event, it never occurred to them that it was a transition to death. Family members, friends, neighbours and sympathizers trooped out to pay their last respect to the deceased members of the Jebe family in Benue State. Four members of the nuclear family passed away in a brutal fashion after being involved in a road accident. The accident took place on the 15th of September 2019 along the Abuja-Akwanga road. The names of the deceased have been given as Mrs. Ngumimi Comfort Jebe, Jebe David Jnr, Jebe Iwueseter Beauty, Jebe Favour Muthie Dooshima. It was an event of tears, distress and gnashing of teeth as the four members of the Jebe family were put in coffins and lowered into the ground. The fate of the deceased has of late become a serious prayer point among social media users praying against the ‘evils of the Ember months’.
