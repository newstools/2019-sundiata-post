Yaounde – One Cameroonian security member was killed on Wednesday in clashes with armed separatists in Nchoubou, a locality in the restive Anglophone region of North-West, according to local authorities. According to the Cameroonian army, the soldier of Cameroon’s elite force, Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR), was killed in an ambush. Meanwhile, four separatists were also killed, an army officer said in anonymity. “Several secessionist terrorists escaped with wounds and the army succeeded to seize their weapons,’’ the officer said. Separatists had in recent time intensified attacks in the two crisis-hit Anglophone regions of North-West and South-West for over a week now. The attacks are in a bid to impose a three-week lockdown to thwart reopening of schools in the regions. Government forces and armed separatists had been clashing in the two regions since 2017, after separatists declared independence of the Anglophone regions from the largely French-speaking Cameroon. According to the UN, about 530,000 people had been displaced so far internally by the conflict.
