Accra – Ghana’s health authorities on Thursday launched a vaccination campaign against polio, a disease that can kill or cripple infected people for life. The four-day campaign, which is being undertaken in the national capital and its environs, will see health officials and volunteers, move from house to house, to markets, lorry stations, among others to vaccinate all children under five years old. Ghana had not recorded any polio cases since 2009 until three new cases were confirmed by health authorities in July this year. The Director-General of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), Anthony Nsiah-Asare, encouraged parents and caregivers to ensure that their children were vaccinated during the campaign. “We are optimistic that the circumstance will not push us back but rather further strengthen us in our fight to eradicate polio,’’ he said. The Country Representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Owen Kaluwa, said the sub-national vaccination activity presents an opportunity for children to be protected against the disease. He called for full support of all sectors to create awareness and generate demand for the vaccination campaign. A follow-up exercise in the national capital will be conducted later this month.
