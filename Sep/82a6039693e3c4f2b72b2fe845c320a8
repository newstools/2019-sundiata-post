Kafanchan – Worried by the lingering violent conflicts in border settlements, authorities of Kaduna, Plateau and Nasarawa States have begun consultations toward seeking amicable solutions to disputes. Mr Charles Danladi, Chairman, Sanga Local Government in Kaduna State, whose area shares boundaries with Plateau and Nasarawa State, revealed this on Sunday in Gwantu, at the end of a three-day prayer and fasting summit. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the summit was organised by the First Babtist Church, Gwantu, to seek God’s intervention in the affairs of the country, especially in crisis-prone areas. “We are making wide consultations with authorities of neighbouring local government areas of Plateau and Nasarawa toward seeking lasting solutions to the lingering security challenges. “We want a more collective solution that will leave no room for recurrences. We all need each other and crave for peace so that development will flourish and the people will be happy,” he said. Danladi urged the residents to eschew bitterness and always seek legal advice  or dialogue in the event of any provocation. “There are competent courts. There are also security agencies and the traditional institutions. Please ventilate your concerns through these established authorities and avoid taking the law into your hands,” he said. Danladi also advised youths in the area to acquire some skills and engage in meaningful ventures rather than allowing themselves to be used by bad elements in the society. The Guest Speaker, Pastor Barnabas Dogara, urged the people to serve as light and salt to non-Christians so as to promote peace and win more souls to Christ through exemplary attitudes. Dogara reminded them that the Christian life required patience, endurance, perseverance and tolerance, noting that the virtues were key to tranquility, development and progress.
