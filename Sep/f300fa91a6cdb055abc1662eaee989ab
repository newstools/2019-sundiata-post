By Idowu Gabriel Ado-Ekiti – The Ekiti Government on Thursday in Ado-Ekiti distributed cooking utensils worth millions of naira to food vendors engaged n the Home Grown School Feeding programme. The Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning, Mr Femi Ajayi, said during the exercise that the gesture was to assist the vendors in preparation ahead of schools’ resumption on Monday. Ajayi stated that the initiative was one of the Social Investment Programmes being executed in partnership with the Federal Government. The commissioner added that the programme, which was designed for primary 1 to 3 classes, would improve the protein intake of the pupils, enhance easy assimilation and increase school enrolment. He noted that since the inception of the programme, children had started encouraging their peers to join them in public schools. Ajayi, who sought the support of the vendors, warned them against compromising the objective of the programme. Prof. Francisca Aladejana, the Chairman of State Universal Basic Education Board, said Fayemi’s love for the poor had influenced his participation in the programme. She told the food vendors to prepare food in a hygienic manner taking into consideration the fragile nature of the children and their low immunity to diseases. Earlier, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Home Grown School Feeding, Mr Adedamola Obanise, had commended Fayemi for facilitating the programme in Ekiti. Obanise, who stated that no fewer than 1,300 vendors were involved in the programme, added that it was providing job opportunities for local women and farmers as well as stimulating the local economy. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that items distributed included iron pots, warmers, bowls, aprons, caps as well as stainless spoons and bowls. (NAN)
