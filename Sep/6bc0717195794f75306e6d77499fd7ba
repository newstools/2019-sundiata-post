Cairo – Sudan’s recently appointed Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok arrived in Egypt on Wednesday for talks on boosting ties between the two neighbours which relationship had been strained in recent years. Hamdok was named Sudan’s prime minister in August under a power- sharing deal between civilian protest leaders and the military, which deposed long-time autocrat Omar al-Bashir in April. Under Al-Bashir, Egyptian-Sudanese ties suffered strains due to a long-running border dispute and Khartoum’s perceived backing for a contested dam being built by Ethiopia on the Nile that Egypt fears will harm its share of water from the river. Hamdok is to meet with senior Egyptian officials to discuss Egyptian-Sudanese relations,as well as regional and international issues of mutual interest, Egyptian state television reported online. During the one-day visit, Hamdok will also confer with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi, the Sudanese official news agency SUNA reported. Hamdok is expected to attend the annual meetings of the UN General Assembly in New York later this month.
