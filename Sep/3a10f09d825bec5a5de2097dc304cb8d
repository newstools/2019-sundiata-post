By Isaac Ukpoju Lafia – Mr Amos Magaji, Programme Manager of the School Feeding Programme in Nasarawa State, has warned vendors and contractors against diversion of food items meant for school pupils. Magaji gave the warning in Lafia on Tuesday at the quarterly meeting with a section of the 2,136 vendors and contractors engaged for the programme in the state. He maintained that anyone found sabotaging the essence of the programme through diversion of food items would face severe sanction. Magaji explained that the essence of the quarterly meeting was to interact with the vendors with the aim of ensuring effective service delivery in line with the objectives of the scheme. He urged them to always exhibit high sense of personal and environmental hygiene in handling foods and desist from unwholesome practices. The programme manager lauded the Federal Government for the initiative as well as the support from the state government toward the success of the programme. “We have recorded impressive enrolment of pupils in our public schools since inception of the programme compared to previous years “We have also put in place mechanism to ensure standard for monitoring and supervision for the success of the programme,’’ Magaji said. He, however, urged stakeholders not to relent in discharging their responsibilities adequately for the sustenance of the programme in the state. NAN)
