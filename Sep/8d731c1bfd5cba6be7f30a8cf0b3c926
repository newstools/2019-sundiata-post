By Aisha Cole Lagos – The Lagos State Ministry of Environment has warned residents to stop patronising cart pushers as their activities have created environmental hazard. The Public Relations Officer of the ministry, Mr Kunle Adesina, gave the warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Monday. According to him, under the law, there is no place for cart pushers at all because experience shows that they do more harm to the environment. “When the cart pushers collect refuse from the residents, they do not take them to the designated points. Is either they drop the refuse in the drainage or canals. “We have been sensitising people through advocacy to stop patronising them. “The cart pushers have been outlawed and if your area is not accessible, I will advise you to drop your refuse in the waste containers in designated areas,’’ Adesina said. He said that the state government had packaged a robust programme to evacuate refuse. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that on Thursday, Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu advised residents of the state to minimse waste by recycling them, thereby creating wealth in the process for themselves. Sanwo-Olu gave the advice at the launch of the Lagos Blue Box initiative programme of the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA). He explained that recycling was a major fortune earner for government and youths. The governor noted that 50 per cent of waste generated in Lagos contained reusable resources, which could be channeled into the economy of the state.
