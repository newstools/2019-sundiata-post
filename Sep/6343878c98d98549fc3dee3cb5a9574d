Nigerians have been digging out throwback pictures of two of the most popular housemates of the Big Brother Naija reality show – Mercy and Tacha. Tacha was dark-skinned form birth but the young lady bleached her skin until she became a ‘brown skin girl’. This is similar to the case of Mercy who didn’t only bleach to become lighter but also doctored her derriere to make it bigger through liposuction. Social media users with eagle eyes have been able to explore the dark knuckles, elbows and fingers of Tacha and Mercy. The bleaching journey of Mercy and Tacha mirrors the bleaching epidemic in Nigeria which has become very rampant among young ladies. Some men are also not left out in the bleaching craze despite the health hazards it might predispose them to. Source
