By Busayo Onijala Lagos – The National Association of Yoruba Descendants in Southern Africa (NAYDSA) has condemned the recurrent attacks on Nigerians and other foreign nationals residing in the rainbow nation. The association’s president, Mr Seyi Akinleye, in a statement on Friday, described the brutal onslaughts on foreign nationals in the rainbow nation as unexpected and inhumane. “Over the past weeks, the foreign communities have been experiencing attacks majorly targeted at businesses in Tshwane Metropolitan, as well as in Johannesburg CBD, Kempton Park, Hilbrow and Jules street. “Many cars and businesses belonging to Nigerians were maliciously burnt to ashes,” he said. Akinleye said that Yoruba descendants were a cultured tribe that valued and respected visitors, irrespective of their origins. “I urge you all to be law abiding citizens and good descendants of Oduduwa during this measurable period and be vigilant till peace reigns again,” the group said. He also urged stakeholders to forward all related information to the appropriate bodies in order to control the circulation of fake news. (NAN)
