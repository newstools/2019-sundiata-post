By Ayodeji Alabi Akure – Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, on Tuesday, called on the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) to ensure that all citizens participate in the ongoing e-registration, to checkmate the activities of illegal immigrants in the country. Akeredolu made the call in Akure while receiving the State Comptroller, NIS, Ondo State Command, Mrs Eunice Aboyade-Yebovi, who paid him a courtesy visit. The governor, who explained that the ongoing e-registration would be a big task due to the nature of the immigrants in the afforested area of the state, urged the officers not to relent in order to achieve their goals. “It might be a big task to register them because they might not know the importance of the registration and then give it a different meaning. “I believe that the time has come, even if you are a Nigerian, you must have either your passport or any means of identification. “That means as a Nigerian, come with your passport, even when you go out of the country and come back. “Every immigrant and citizen need to have passport to make the issue of e-registration easier in the country,” he said. Speaking earlier, the comptroller said that the e-registration of immigrants had already commenced in some states, and solicited for the assistance of the state government. She requested the assistance of the governor for a befitting state command office and a boat for the command’s base at Igbokoda, in Ilaje Local Government Area for effective service delivery. (NAN)
