By Blessing Ibegbu Abuja – A Karu Magistrates’ Court, Abuja, on Monday sentenced a 32-year-old man, Bashiru Umoru to six months imprisonment for breaking into a shop and stealing  the sum of N30,000. The convict, who resides in Niger State had pleaded guilty to a four-count charge of criminal trespass, mischief, shop breaking and theft, but begged for leniency. The judge, Nuhu Abbah, did not give the convict an option of fine. Earlier, the prosecutor, Vincent Osuji, had told the court that one Brodrick Oyigbo of Karu Site, Abuja, reported the matter at the Karu Police Station on Sept. 14, 2019. “The complainant alleged that on same date, the convict trespassed into his wife’s shop at the above mentioned address, deliberately damaged the entrance padlock and broke into the shop. “In the process, the convict stole the sum of N30,000, before he was caught and apprehended and all effort to recover  the stolen money proved abortive,” Osuji said. The offence contravened sections 348, 353, 327 and 287 of the Penal Code
