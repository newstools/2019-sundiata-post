Popular Nigerian comic actor, Ime Bishop Umoh popularly known as Okon Lagos and comedian Okey Bakassi reacts to Khafi eviction from the Big Brother Naija house. Okon and Okey Bakassi said Big Brother Naija is a reflection of the society in which the stupid wins. Okon said:
“If you are a young person in this country, a Nigerian youth, the only and worse offense that you can commit is for you to have sense. The moment you are brilliant, know book and stand out, you become an enemy. The youth of this country pretend to want change. Khafi wey we sabi say she get sense, the one wey dey stupid una go keep am, sometimes hee fit win. Okey Bakassi said:
“I just finish watching the Big Brother eviction show. Its a reflection of the society actually how the smart, intelligent, weak, docile and even the stupid co-exist. Its also talks about politics and how the people vote. Most times you will think the smart intelligent ones will be the one winning but sometimes the stupid have a way of hanging around for too long. At the end of the show if the very stupid one wins, it is you the voting people. It tells us about ourselves and preferences.
