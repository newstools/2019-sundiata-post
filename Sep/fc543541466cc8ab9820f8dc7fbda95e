By Judith Ezeudogu Abuja – A Karu Chief Magistrates’ Court, Abuja, on Friday, admitted a commercial motorcyclist, Abubakar Usman, to a N200,000 bail for slapping and inflicting injuries on another person. Abubakar, who resides in Rugan Madaki, Nasarawa state, was arraigned on a two-count charge of criminal force without provocation and voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous means. The judge, Mariam Bukola, granted the defendant a N200,000 bail, with one surety, and adjourned the case until Sept. 19, for hearing. The Prosecution Counsel, Vincent Osuji, told the court that the complainant, Sadiku Yusuf, who lived at Kpegyi Abuja, reported the matter at the Karu police station on Aug. 27. Osuji told the court that while the complainant and his colleagues were at their duty post at Karu abattoir, waiting for rain to stop, the defendant also came there to hide from the rain. “While waiting for the rain to stop, the defendant started making inciting statements that he would deal with the defendant and his colleagues. “He went further to assault him by slapping the complainant; he also picked stones and threw them at him, and used stick to hit his head, thereby inflicting injuries on him,’’ the prosecutor said. The prosecutor said that the complainant was currently receiving treatment at ECWA Clinic in Karu. Osuji said that the offence contravened the provisions of Sections 265(b) and 248 of the Penal Code. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. (NAN)
