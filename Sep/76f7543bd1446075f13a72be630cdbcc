By Imelda OsayandeImpatience Benin – Mr Anthony Oko, the Edo Sector Commandant of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has attributed impatience among drivers as major cause of accidents on highways in the country. Oko disclosed this on Wednesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin. According to him, motorists are always in a hurry; this is what I described as impatience and is the major causes of auto crashes in the country. “It is worse in this ‘Ember months’ a period where we will be experiencing untrained motorists with deficiency vehicles coming out as commercial drivers to pick passengers. “These set of motorists are more in a hurry to pick and drop passengers in quest of making money to celebrate Christmas.’’ he said. He noted that majority of the commercial buses and cabs during `Ember months’ were most times not road worthy. Oko explained that most of them were vehicles parked for a long time and all of a sudden taken to the mechanic for repair in order to make money for the Christmas celebrations. He, however, cautioned passengers to be more careful about the vehicles they board, adding that life has no duplicate.
