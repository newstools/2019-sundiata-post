HARARE – The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that Zimbabwe needed to intensify efforts on economic and political fronts, adding that the country faced a steep economic contraction this year. “Policy actions are urgently needed to tackle the root causes of economic instability and enable private-sector led growth,” the IMF, which visited Harare this month to review progress on a staff-monitored programme, said in a statement. “The key challenge is to contain fiscal spending consistent with non-inflationary financing and tighten monetary policy to stabilise the exchange rate and start rebuilding confidence in the national currency.” (Reuters)
