Imo state – A video has surfaced showing the moments some hoodlums pulled down a billboard erected in support of BBNaija housemate, Tacha in Imo state. Angry thugs have pulled down a massive billboard which was made to campaign for controversial Big Brother Naija housemate, Tacha in Imo State. It was gathered that the thugs pulled down the billboard yesterday, September 25th. Recall that Owerri fans rooting for the Port Harcourt first daughter and the self-aclaimed, ‘No leave, no transfer’ erected the billboard to campaign for their favourite housemate. Tacha is among the five housemates nominated for possible eviction by the Ultimate VETO Power holder, Frodd. However, the fans of another contestant, Mercy who is from Owerri, Imo state countered the move by pulling down the billboard saying they cannot allow another contestant to dominate their state when their daughter is still in the house.
