A popular singer has revealed the battle she has been fighting since she started bleaching her skin. Ghanaian singer, Mzbel has opened up with her battle with skin bleaching. The musician revealed that using bleaching cream has left her with regrets. Mzbel revealed that she is now envious of black girls because being white is not who she is. She told Abeiku Santana on UTV’s Atuu show that the act she regrets led to a spiritual journey aimed at quitting bleaching.“I have come to understand life and I am trying to connect to who I am, as a black person I don’t think I have to be apologizing for being black.“I don’t care if people start saying I am black now, being white is not who I am and anytime I see someone with dark complexion I jealous the person. I move from Church to Church because I’m on a spiritual journey to quit bleaching”, she said. Source
