By Joy Mbachi Awka, – Anambra State Physical Planning Board has warned developers against building of structures without approval of the board in the state. Mr Chike Maduekwe, the Executive Chairman of the Board, said the board would sustain its mandate of ensuring controlled infrastructural development across the state. Maduekwe, who made the call in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Awka, warned developers who still engage in building without approval from the board to stop forthwith or face legal action. He said that the board recently demolished shanties in some areas in Awka, adding that more would be done at the expense of the defaulters. “In spite of the board’s warnings to rid the state of illegal shanties, some citizens have continued to erect such unapproved structures and we cannot accommodate the disobedience anymore. “We have commenced demolishing shanties erected in front of the office of the Transport Company of Anambra State and structures under the EEDC high tension power cable. “Enough warming has been given to the people but they chose to do otherwise. This exercise will be carried out across the state and constant monitoring will be done to ensure compliance. “We receive intelligence reports, which indicate that some people hide within the shanties to perpetrate crime, especially at night and we must put a stop to criminal acts in Anambra,” he said. Maduekwe assured residents that the board has enough manpower to enforce compliance, including prosecution, and therefore, called on the people to do the right thing to avoid being prosecuted.
