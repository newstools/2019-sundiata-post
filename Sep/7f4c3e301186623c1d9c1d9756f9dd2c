Big Brother Naija housemate, Mercy has opened up on why she allowed Ike to have a week’s immunity after the HoH challenge that ended in a draw. After the HoH challenge that saw both of them emerge as winners, Diane went to hold Ike’s shirt for allowing her friend give up immunity. Mercy then told her not to worry and that she did it with her pure heart. She had wanted to give him a gift and that was just the perfect one. Mercy also said he wanted immunity so bad and has been saying he wanted HoH so he wouldn’t be up for possible eviction. She also said she knew he was scared but she wasn’t. See video below: Source
