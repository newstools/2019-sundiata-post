By Deji Abdulwahab Abuja – All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain,  Mr Yekini Nabena says that President Muhammadu Buhari’s nomination of Mr Bernard Okumagba as the Managing Director, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), is for the development of the region. Nabena, who is also the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of APC,  gave the advice on Sunday while speaking with journalists in Abuja. The Western Ijaw Consultative Assembly had in a statement issued on Sept. 3 by its Chairman, Mr Ebipade Gbegha, protested against the nomination of Okumagba as the Managing Director of NDDC. Nabena was reacting to the group’s statement, faulting Okumagba’s nomination over his alleged non-membership of the APC and being Urhobo. The APC spokesman said that some aggrieved persons within the party were responsible for the campaign of calumny against Buhari’s choice of Okumagba. “From checks, the faceless group is being sponsored by a few thoughtless and greedy power seekers within and outside the APC fold in Delta. “As affirmed by the APC in Delta, Okumagba is a foremost party member of the party in the state, one of the national delegates that represented Warri South in two previous APC National Conventions,” he said.
