Tehran, – The foreign ministers of the member states of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) may meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), a top Iranian official has said. The Iranian Foreign Ministry’s Spokesman Abbas Mousavi said this on Thursday. According to the spokesman, Russia, China, France, the UK, and Germany have recently suggested holding a meeting of the foreign ministers of the JCPOA countries, although it was supposed to take place before the UNGA. “Considering the circumstances at the moment, this meeting might happen on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly if the Iranian delegation comes to New York,” Mousavi told Khabar Online outlet. The 74th session of the General Assembly began Tuesday. The first day of the high-level General Debate will be Tuesday, 24 Sept. 2019. On Wednesday, Iranian media reported that President Hassan Rouhani and his delegation, including Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, may skip the UNGA meeting since the U.S. had not yet issued them visas. The visa situation was later confirmed to Tasnim News Agency by Zarif. JCPOA was signed in 2015 by Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK, the U.S., and Germany together with the European Union.It required Iran to scale back its nuclear programme and severely downgrade its uranium reserves in exchange for sanctions relief. In 2018, the U.S. abandoned its conciliatory policy on Iran, withdrawing from the JCPOA and hitting Iranian petroleum industries with sanctions, prompting criticism from its allies in Europe. A year later, Tehran began abandoning its commitments to the JCPOA. This process is currently in its third stage. During the week of the debate, several other high-level events also will convene going by the programme schedule for the UN Geenral Assembly. These are:On Monday, Sept. 23, the UN Secretary-General will convene a Climate Summit, and the UNGA will hold a one-day high-level meeting on Universal Health Coverage.
