He made the pledge on Monday in a statement signed by the State Publicity Secretary, Doifie Buokoribo sent to Sundiata Post. Lyon says, “Please, accept this as my heartfelt thanks for your massive support for my candidature. I acknowledge the contributions of all APC members to the success of the exercise. “The overwhelming vote of the people is a testament to their immense confidence in my person, my experience, and my abilities. I promise to put all these and much more to the service of Bayelsa State, if elected governor on November 16. “I make a solemn pledge this day never to disappoint my party, APC, and the people of Bayelsa State. I will not abuse this huge confidence reposed in me by the people.” He extends a hand of fellowship to the other contestants at the primary election, saying, “Your fervent approach to the primary election campaign and the election itself to pick our governorship candidate is an indication of your passion for the success of our party. But in every election, there is a winner. “We disagreed to agree. Now is the time to come together, work together, and strategise together to move our party and our state forward. “Let us rally round our campaign for ‘A Better Bayelsa for All’. Let us put Bayelsa first and set aside our personal differences. “Our state has suffered too much in the hands of Governor Seriake Dickson to allow the present regime to continue under any proxy or guise. The time to change this regime of backwardness, pain and poverty is now.”
