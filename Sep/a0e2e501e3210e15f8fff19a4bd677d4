Former Minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili on Saturday said the Nigerian government did not go after her just because she attended the World Economic Forum, WEF, in South Africa which it boycotted, but a part of a cheap and frustrated strategy designed to bully, slander, denigrate her at every opportunity. Ezekwesili, in series of tweets said “You’d be naive to think that the mob action the @NigeriaGov planned, incited and orchestrated against me was “because she went to @wef when the country boycotted it”. No. Just part of a cheap & frustrated strategy designed to bully, slander, denigrate me at every opportunity.” Source
