By Chinyere Omeire Ikeja – An unemployed man, Bakare Akeem, on Tuesday appeared  before an Ikeja High Court in Lagos for allegedly killing his neighbour with a wooden object. Akeem, whose address was not given, is facing a charge of murder, to which he pleaded not guilty. The Lagos State Prosecutor, Mr O. I. Seshan, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on June 26, 2018 at 10.10 p.m. at Dopemu in Ikeja. Seshan said the defendant killed one Ikechukwu Eguzuoba by heating his head with a plank. The prosecutor said the offence contravened Section 223 of the Criminal Law of 2015. He urged the court to remand the defendant in custody and commence an accelerated trial. Counsel to the defendant Mrs S. D. Bakenni-Salami said she was still studying the case file as she just got the proof of evidence. Justice Mojisola Dada remanded Akeem in prison and adjourned the case until Oct. 29 for trial. (NAN)
