By Ugonne Uzoma Owerri – Enugu  Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) says it has completed two major projects worth over N200 million to improve power supply in Imo. This is contained in a statement  on Tuesday, issued by its Head of Communications, Mr Emeka Ezeh. He said that the projects were in line with the company’s committment to improving the socio-economic state of the Southeast region. “The projects are a dedicated 33KV line constructed for an industrial customer and Oguta 33KV double circuit line. Both lines will radiate from Egbu Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) Station,” he said. According to him, the industrial 33KV line has a route length of about 38 kilometers, and is designed to improve availability to the industrial customer, while the Oguta 33KV line with double circuit has a route length of about 11 kilometers, and will feed new Owerri, Port Harcourt Road and Onitsha Road axis. He stated that the second Oguta 33KV feeder, which fed the Oguta, Ogbaku and Mgbidi axis, would alleviate the poor supply situation experienced by customers within the area. Ezeh also disclosed that the investment was informed by the frequency of power interruption  in new Owerri. He said that the new line, which was free from “line loads” and less prone to interruption, would serve to stabilise supply availability in new Owerri and its environs. According to him, customers served by these newly commissioned projects will experience improved supply. He also reassured customers of the company’s commitment toward improved service deliver. Ezeh encouraged them to reciprocate this by ensuring they pay their electricity bills and  avoid energy theft and meter bypass. He encouraged them to safeguard all electricity installations serving them. The company commended the Imo  government and the TCN for their support in ensuring  the projects were actualised.
