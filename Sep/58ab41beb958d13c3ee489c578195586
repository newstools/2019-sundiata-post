By Taiye Olayemi Lagos – The National Council for Women Society (NCWS) has commended the Inspector General of Police, Mr Mohammed Adamu, for spearheading the campaign against moral decadence in the country.The society also lauded Mr Olusegun Runsewe, the Director General, National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), for exposing the unbecoming conducts of Nigerian transgender celebrity, “Bobrisky”, as the IGP intervenes to stem the ugly trend.The President of NCWS, Dr Laraba Shoda, gave the commendation in a statement in Lagos issued through Runsewe’s media aide, Mr Frank Meke. ” We at the NCWS are happy that our visit to the DG of NCAC has yielded positive responses from the government and the public.” This is indicated by the actions so far taken and the messages we continue to receive from well-meaning Nigerians,” she said. Shoda decried the erosion of nation’s cultural values and the importation of alien cultures such as indecent exposure and open sexual activities on electronic media.She lamented that the unwanton show of cross gender activities was projecting a negative image to Nigerian youths as  Bobrisky’s activities were not representative of nation’s culture. According to her, the Nigerian culture and law recognised the clear distinction between men and women, reiterating that anything to the contrary was absurd, unacceptable and should be resisted.” It is regrettable and strange for Bobrisky to publicly declare that he has 24 boy friends in high places as he stated on his Instagram handle,” she said.Shoda called on Nigerian government and all well-meaning citizens to rise up and stop the evil before it would have adverse effects on children and the future of the nation.” The protection of our noble cultural heritage and national image is of paramount importance to us all,” she said.
