By Emmanuel Acha Enugu – Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) Enugu State Command on Monday inaugurated its special squad known as Agro Rangers. NSCDC State Commandant, Mr Everestus Obiyo, said that the squad was part of their response to check clashes between herders and farmers. Obiyo said the squad would also control the killings and wanton destruction of lives and property in the state. He said the officers had been trained to intervene between the farmers and herdsmen. The commandant also said that the scheme was designed to give physical protection to Agro Allied Investments, including farmlands, livestock, silos, ranches and others. Obiyo said the officers had received training on the protection of the citizenry from kidnapping, robbery and other violent crimes. “This will go a long way to help protect our local and foreign investments in agriculture. “It will give us more for export earnings and boost local industries for growth and offer employment opportunities to our teeming youthful population. “It is our utmost desire to provide effective and robust security coverage within Enugu State and its environs,” obiyo said. In a remark, Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, said the scheme provided for the arrest and prosecution of arms-bearing herdsmen or farmers. Ugwuanyi said the move was a worthy complement in the efforts of his administration for protection of the citizens from kidnapping, robbery and other violent crimes. The governor said the state remained one of the most peaceful and secure states in the country in spite of recent security challenges. He said there had been a decline in the number of clashes between farmers and herdsmen as well as other criminal activities. “As a government, we want to pledge our full support, cooperation and assistance to ensure the overall success of the Agro Allied Forces initiative in Enugu state,” ugwuanyi said.
