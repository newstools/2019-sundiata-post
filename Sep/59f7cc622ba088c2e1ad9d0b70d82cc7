By Ismaila Chafe Abuja – The Presidency on Tuesday announced the postponement of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting slated for Wednesday, Sept. 4. Malam Garba Shehu, the President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, confirmed this development in a statement in Abuja. Shehu stated that the decision to postpone the meeting was informed by the fact that all the memos earlier submitted to the Council for consideration had been returned to the various ministries. ”This action will allow ministers who were recently sworn in have their inputs in the memos sent by their predecessors in office. ”Similarly, the period is to enable the ministers, who are still taking briefs from bureaucrats in the ministries and familiarising themselves with their work space, have more time to contribute to discussions at the meeting. ”They will also utilise the period of the break to work towards the early preparation and submission of the 2020 budget estimates,” he further explained.
