YENAGOA – Madam Ogere Beauty Siasia, mother of former Super Eagle skipper and coach, Samson Siasia, has regained her freedom after spending over two months with her kidnappers. Reports just coming in from Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, on Sunday morning said that the 80-year-old has been released by her abductors. Since she was taken away at dusk from her house, her famous son had been begging the kidnappers to release her as he did not have the huge ransom they were demanding. He also appealed to both the federal and state governments to come to his family’s rescue. (News Express)
