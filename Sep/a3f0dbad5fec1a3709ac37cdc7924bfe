By Akeem Abas Ibadan – The Oyo State Police Command on Friday in Ibadan said it arrested six suspects for various offences ranging from murder to fraud. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Shina Olukolu, told newsmen on Friday that the feat was part of the breakthroughs recorded by the command. The News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) reports that three of the suspects allegedly committed murder while the remaining three were arrested for fraudulent activities. Olukolu also called on the people to be wary of the antics and fraudulent activities of criminals in the society. “Their modus operandi is premised on deceit, false prophecy, fake power of clairvoyance, dubious identification and outright lies with a view to taking advantage of their targeted victims who are usually vulnerable and young persons or minors. “Hence, do not allow strangers access to your premises under whatever guise no matter how plausible,” he said. The commissioner also cautioned residents to be conscious of their environment, and refuse unsolicited offer of assistance, saying it might be a ploy by fraudsters to defraud them. Olukolu assured that the police would continue to be on the look out for criminally minded individuals in the society and to deal with them in accordance with the law. (NAN)
