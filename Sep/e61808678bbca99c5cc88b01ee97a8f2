A Nigerian man known as Chief Justice Igwe on Facebook has decided to return to Nigeria after his sojourn in South Africa. Igwe was one of the supporters of former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar who vied for the post of the president of Nigeria with incumbent leader, President Muhammadu Buhari. As the results of the presidential election started trickling in the month of February this year, and it appeared that Atiku was trailing Buhari, Mr. Igwe fled the country for better opportunities abroad. He had no faith in Buhari, so he saw no reason why he should remain in the country. The young man who hails from the South-eastern part of Nigeria left for South Africa. “This elect results not interesting….finding my way off Nigeria now,” he posted on his Facebook account on the 26th of February, 2019. Events didn’t go as planned in South Africa due to the crises of xenophobia leading to vicious attacks on foreigners as well as their properties by locals. Mr. Igwe has now boarded a free flight heading back to Nigeria courtesy of Air Peace, after the Buhari administration facilitated the repatriation of hundreds of Nigerians living in South Africa as they fear for their lives. Igwe will be returning to Nigeria to deal with the Buhari-managed ailing economy which he fled from in the first place. Above is a screenshot of his Facebook post while leaving Nigeria and a recent one he made announcing his imment return home. Source
