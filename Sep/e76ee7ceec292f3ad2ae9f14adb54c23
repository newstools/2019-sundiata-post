Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Chris Ngige Minister of Labour and Employment, has said members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) cannot attack him outside Nigeria because he fed them and protected their interest when he was governor of Anambra state. Speaking during a function in Obosi, Anambra
State, Ngige further explained that was the reason the group welcomed him when
he recently travelled to the USA. “IPOB was registered by the late  President General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Dr Dozie Ikedife and other Igbos as a non-violent group. What is going on now in the group is not part of the work plan . I visited the United States of America recently, and I  was welcomed by IPOB members. “They knew I fed and protected them when I was
in office as governor. I have said it several times that Biafra cannot be
achieved the IPOB way. The Igbo should stop shouting marginalisation. They
should stand up and assert themselves to be counted. Nigeria belongs to all of
us. Equity favours the Igbo to produce the next president of the country,
but they must work hard and position themselves for it. “We should stop political sentiments.
Politicians don’t give power based on sentiment and emotion. President
Muhammadu Buhari has said he is favourable to an Igbo president. We must
support him and associate with the APC. Nobody will give you president of
Nigeria in your bedroom.”
