By Emperor Simon Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  Police have confirmed the arrest of sixty-two
suspected political thugs in Niger State following the violence that rocked the
Local Government primaries conducted by the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Public Relations Officer of the State
Police Command, Mr Abubakar Dan-Inna, confirmed this in a statement on Sunday. Three persons were said to have been killed in
Shiroro Local Government while there were reports of pockets of clashes among
party supporters in other local government areas during the primaries which
held on September 7. Dan-Inna explained that the suspects arrested
by the police in five local government areas were in possession of weapons and
deadly substances suspected to be hard drugs. Some of the items recovered from them,
according to him, included a vehicle loaded with machetes, daggers and knives. The Command’s spokesman noted that the
suspects have been charged to court for unlawful assembly, disturbance of
public peace, and for sponsoring thuggery in accordance with the state’s
Anti-Thuggery Law. He added that the Commissioner of Police in
the state, Abubakar Usman, vowed that the Command under his watch would not allow
disgruntled elements to continue to harass innocent citizens. Usman, therefore, warned those planning to
disrupt the forthcoming local government elections to have a rethink. “Anyone with any grievances in the conduct of the primary
election should seek redress in the court of law rather than resorting to
violence,” the police commissioner was quoted as saying.
