BENIN – The Edo State Police Command has commenced an investigation into the death of an operative of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Benin, the Edo State capital. Although investigations have not been concluded, it is suspected that the deceased, Williams Oyibogare, died of suicide because two bottles of a pesticide, Sniper, were found in his home located in the Giwa Amu area along the Airport Road. It was further alleged that a suicide note was found on his phone which the police have already recovered. Spokesman for the EFCC, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed Oyibogare’s death, but said the Commission was waiting for the police to conclude its investigation before making any further comment. “It is true that one of our operatives died. The Police have begun an investigation into the matter and we hope to hear from them soon. That is all we can say for now,” Uwujaren said. A colleague of the deceased said that Oyibogare recently returned from his annual leave looking emaciated. She, however, said it was too soon to make any conclusion. “He returned from leave recently. He looked pale and seemed to have lost weight. He may have died from an illness or it could also have been suicide but we cannot say for sure since we don’t live with him. Let us wait for the police to conclude its probe. An autopsy would be able to reveal the real cause of death,” she said. Speaking with our correspondent on the telephone, the Police Public Relations Officer, Edo Command, Chidi Nwabuzor, said the police would wait for the autopsy before making further comment on the matter. Nwabuzor said: “Investigations are on-going, and it would be too soon to make any conclusions at this stage; it is too early to make any pronouncements. Of course, there will be an autopsy to know the cause of death and inquire about what happened.” (New Telegraph)
