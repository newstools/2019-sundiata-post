Abuja (The Katsina State Government has revealed plans to negotiate the release of 20 of its indigenes, who were kidnapped by bandits and sold as slaves in Burkina Faso. According to
Guardian newspaper, the victims were sold to a human trafficker in Benin
Republic, who then resold them to another buyer in Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso
is notorious, in some circles, as a country of origin, transit and destination
for persons, mostly children, subjected to human trafficking, specifically
forced labour and prostitution. It was
gathered that the locations of the victims were discovered following an
interaction between Governor Aminu Bello Masari and some repentant bandits in
eight council areas of the state. The council
areas are, Jibia, Faskari, Danmusa, Kankara, Safana, Sabuwa, Dandume and
Batsari, and they share border with Rugu forest, a dreaded hideout for bandits. Special
Adviser to the governor on Drugs, Narcotics and Human Trafficking, Hamza
Borodo, confirmed the incident; adding that he would soon travel to Burkina
Faso to negotiate the release of the 20 victims. “Yes, I will be
traveling to Burkina Faso this weekend to negotiate their release, but I won’t
give you details until I return,” Borodo said
