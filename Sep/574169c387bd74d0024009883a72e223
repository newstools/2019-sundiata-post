The Edo State Police Command, yesterday, said it has uncovered and destroyed major flashpoints and hideouts of kidnappers and other criminal elements terrorising residents and motorists in the state. The State Commissioner of Police, Danmallam Mohammed, disclosed this to newsmen while parading over 100 suspects alleged to have been involved in various crimes ranging from armed robbery, cultism and kidnapping. Danmallam said the state has recorded rising cases of kidnapping, hence the move to raid their hideout in the forest leading to the arrest of some kidnap suspects and other criminal suspects. “In continuation of the investigation of the murder of three policemen at Ogba Zoo and the kidnap of the managing Director of the Zoo on 24th September, 2017, One Michael Ayigie, a key suspect in the mayhem was arrested by the command on 26th August, 2019. He confessed to the heinous crime and is helping with investigation. “In the same vein, three kidnappers who kidnapped three persons at different locations within Iyanomo and Obayantor were arrested by the command. They later killed one of the victims named Adeleke Adebare. “Also, two kidnappers were also arrested for allegedly kidnapping one Obasi Nnamdi Charles along Agbado Street in Benin City and whisked him to a unknown destination in his car and thereafter shot him in his head, after taking him to his ATM,” the Police Boss said.
