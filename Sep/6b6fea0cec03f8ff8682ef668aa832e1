Tel Aviv –  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be tasked with forming the new government, the president’s office says. President Reuven Rivlin’s office made the announcement after talks to form a unity government between Netanyahu’s Likud party and the centrist Blue and White party’s leader Benny Gantz failed. Netanyahu, whose party came out of last week’s general elections with a one-seat edge, now has 28 days to complete the task. (dpa/NAN)
