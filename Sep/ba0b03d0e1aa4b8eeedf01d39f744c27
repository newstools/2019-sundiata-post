Beijing – China’s Huawei on Tuesday confirmed that it had dropped a lawsuit against the U.S. government after Washington released telecommunications equipment it had seized two years earlier on suspicion of violations of export controls. The Chinese company, which was placed on a U.S. trade blacklist earlier in 2019, said Washington had returned the equipment in August after confirming that no export license was required. The U.S. accused Huawei of facilitating Chinese government spying and had put pressure on Western allies not to use the company’s technology. Huawei, however, denied espionage claims. The Chinese company had in recent time, become a major component of the U.S-China trade war, though relations thawed somewhat after the G20 in Japan, as both sides agreed to resume talks.
