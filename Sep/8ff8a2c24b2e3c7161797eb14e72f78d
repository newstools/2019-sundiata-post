Bayelsa – Luck has ran out on a suspected armed robber after he was shot by men of the Nigerian army. A dare devil armed robber has been shot by officers of the Nigerian Army. It was gathered that the the suspect is one of the four daredevil armed robbers who dispossessed a bank customer of about N1.5 million in Bayelsa on Monday. It was gathered that the hoodlums trailed the bank customer, said to be the Deputy Governor’s brother, to an office complex close to his filling station located at the Opolo axis of the Isaac Boro Expressway in Yenagoa. The robbers who wore masks accosted the victim as he was driving into the office complex, broke the back glass of his car and removed a small Ghana Must Go bag containing about N1.5m. However, soldiers passing by in a military van opened fire on the fleeing robbers. A bullet hit one of them on his stomach and he fell to the ground. The other three managed to get away with the money and varying degrees of bullet wounds. All exit routes around the area have been blocked by policemen and the soldiers to prevent them from escaping. The situation caused a heavy traffic congestion around that axis of the expressway.
