Herdsmen said to be of Fulani extraction yesterday killed three people at Hukke village, Miango District in Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State. Spokesman for Miango Youth Development Association, Mr. Lawrence Zongo, said in a statement yesterday that the two women and a community leader were killed. The attack came barely two days after a peace agreement was signed between the leaders of the Fulani herdsmen and Irigwe leaders organised by the Plateau Peace Building Agency to mark the International Day of Peace with the theme: “Climate Action for Peace, Promoting Healing, Forgiveness and Reconciliation,” at Miango Town Hall. “Today, 23/09/2019 by 8.15a.m., Fulani herdsmen killed three people at Hukke village of Miango District, Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State. “Two women and a community leader were killed. The attack was a surprise to us after we agreed to accept peace process by the Plateau State Peace Building Agency last Saturday. “Names of the decease are Mrs. Ladi Wuh (45), Mrs. Laraba Audu (36-year-old deaf) and Elder Musa Yevuh (40), community leader of Hukke,” Zongo said. He said the suspected Fulani herdsmen came for the attack from Funture village in Bassa Local Government Area. Zongo said they would continue to be peaceful and law-abiding. He, however, urged government to be more responsible in protecting lives and property of rural communities. It was learnt that the Miango people of Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State have since 2010 continued to suffer incessant attacks from gunmen. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Mathias Tyopev, could not be reached to confirm the attack. (New Telegraph) Source News Express
