… Calls For Punishment Of Sexual
Offenders By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) Regional Vice President for Africa, Chief Mrs. Victoria Awomolo SAN, has commended Ekiti State government for opening Sexual Offenders Register in the state. Awomolo gave
the commendation on Wednesday in an exclusive interview with Sundiata Post in
her Abuja office while condemning the increasing incidences of rape in the country. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria who noted that the rate at which cases of rape are recorded is now embarrassing, called for punishment of sexual Offenders. According to
FIDA Regional President, ”Gender violence particularly rape, is in the increase
now. Look at Nigeria, there is no day that passes without incidences of rape of
minors; rape of old women; by pastors, by fathers etc and you wonder why. “What will
push a 50-year old man to rape a 2-year old girl for example? At first they said
the women were dressing indecently. What is in the 2-year old girl even 6
months old baby that a man wants to touch her? What is attractive to a father in
his own daughter that he will rape her? The last one I read about two day ago
was that a man was having sexual affair with his daughter since she is age 9
and now she is 19. Why will a father do that to his daughter?” She asked. The FIDA Regional Vice President therefore
commended the First Lady of
Ekiti and the Attorney General of the state for opening a sexual offender’s
register where names of people convicted of any sexual offence will be registered
for life for everybody to know and to see.
