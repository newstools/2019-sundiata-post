Brussels –  The British government has not made any new Brexit proposals to Brussels, according to the head of the European Parliament, David Sassoli. “The UK has not proposed any alternatives, anything that is legally credible and workable,” Sassoli said, referring to Britain’s insistence on abandoning the so-called Irish backstop. Sassoli was speaking after a meeting with the leaders of the European Parliament’s political groups and chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, The EU is prepared to postpone the Brexit date again if Britain gives a good reason, he says – such as avoiding a no-deal Brexit, having a general election or extending article 50. “Unfortunately the signals we are getting aren’t indicating that there is any initiative that could reopen the negotiations. “That is not the way we see it. And we are unhappy about that,” he added.
