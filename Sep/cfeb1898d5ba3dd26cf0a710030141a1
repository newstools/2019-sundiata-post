•IPOB Leader Nnamdi Kanu AWKA – The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has hailed its members in Japan for the rousing welcome and support given to its leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, during the town-hall meeting held in Nagoya and Tokyo Japan between September 21 and 24, 2019. The group explained that the tour of Asia by its leader is a diplomatic overture as well as to rally the Biafran base for the restoration of Biafra within the shortest possible time, IPOB said the visit and town-hall meeting hosted in Japan brought completely the issue of Biafra to the knowledge and well informed of government and citizens of Japan. A statement on Sunday by IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Comrade Emma Powerful, said that Biafrans across Japan have been re-energised and powered with the message of hope and restoration. It noted that the visit did not only captivate Biafran audiences who attended the events, “but it has permeated the subconscious of every black African and Japanese who has come into contact with the message of redemption.” IPOB while commending the Japanese government and her citizens for the acceptance of Biafran people within the Japanese territory, said: “Biafrans across the far eastern part of the world have publicly pledged their moral and material support for Biafra restoration as piloted by IPOB. “Many more IPOB family meetings, influential individuals and diaspora organisations are queuing up to host our leader in various cities across Asian countries. We expect Biafrans and non-Biafrans alike to gather to welcome and listen to him preach the gospel of the restoration of Biafra at a town hall meeting.” “We promise to do all we can to restore Biafra at the earliest possible opportunity by the grace of Almighty God.” (News Express)
