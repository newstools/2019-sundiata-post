Joshua is confident ahead of the rematch and claims he knows some of the Mexican’ s weaknesses. Anthony Joshua has vowed to “expose” Andy Ruiz Jr in their world heavyweight championship rematch. Ruiz Jr shocked Joshua to win the IBF, WBA and WBO titles in June. But a second fight will take place in Saudi Arabia on December 7. Joshua is confident ahead of the rematch and claims he knows some of the Mexican’s weaknesses. “A little blip should not change you as a person.“You should stay consistent with who you are.“I can become familiar with him. I know what I’m in for. I know what I’m capable of. I know what he’s capable of.“I know some of the attributes he possesses, and some of the weaknesses. I have to go about exposing him a little bit more.“The first time I had him down [in the first fight], I could have been smarter. These little things you think about in your head.“Now I meet him eye-to-eye again and, subconsciously, the clock is ticking and I start thinking more and more about the fight,” Joshua told Sky Sports.
