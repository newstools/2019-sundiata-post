The second batch of Nigerians being evacuated from South Africa have arrived in Lagos. The 314 returnees and the Head of Immigration and Consular Matters at Nigeria’s Consulate General in Johannesburg, Mr. Anthony Ogbe, had boarded the Air Peace flight and left South Africa around 3:00 pm. They arrived at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport around 7:20 pm and are currently waiting to be profiled by the immigration. About 319 Nigerians were initially billed to return on Tuesday in the wake of xenophobic attacks in South Africa. But their flight was delayed as a result of the airline not obtaining a landing permit on time. Of the 319, four passengers were later dropped over documentation issues. Prior to their return, a first batch of 187 Nigerians had been voluntarily evacuated and profiled according to their states.
