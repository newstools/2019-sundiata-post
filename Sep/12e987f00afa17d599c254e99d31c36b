Abuja – A Nigerian pastor has told a rather interesting story about how a strange lady tried to seduce him at his hotel room. Dr Gospel Agochukwu, a Nigerian evangelist, has shared his encounter with a former “s*x worker” in Abuja. According to Agochukwu, a few years ago, the s*x worker knocked on his door with the intention of sleeping with him for money. He stated that he instead, spent few minutes preaching the word of God to the said lady and in no time, she started reeling in tears. Arochukwu added that the encounter changed the lady’s life as she quit prostitution and became ‘born again.’The lady is reportedly now married and based in London with her husband and child.
