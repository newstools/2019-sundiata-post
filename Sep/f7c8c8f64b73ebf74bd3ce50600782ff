Big Brother Naija housemates, Omoshola and Seyi have been caught on camera discussing about Tacha and what her exit from the house has done for the serenity and calm of the house. Recall that the Port Harcourt daughter was disqualified after engaging in a violent conduct with fellow housemate, Mercy. During their discussion, Omashola stated that Tachaâ€™s presence in the house was bad as the Port Harcourt first daughter lived off the negative vibe and she was indeed bad energy to them all and the show too. Omoshola also stated that the energy in the house turned from zero to one hundred and everyone suddenly became happy.
