GEJ was President for 5 years, there was no Niger Delta radio.. Buhari President, under 4 years has opened Fulani radio… Where do you think all of this is heading to. My people, these people don enter our 18. Let’s all adjust ourselves. I smell a truck load of wahala coming,” he wrote. Source: qed.ng
