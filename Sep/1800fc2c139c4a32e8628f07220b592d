Isiolo (Kenya) – Four Kenya Defence Forces (KDF), officers were killed on Monday in a road accident at a busy highway in central Kenya, the Police confirmed on Monday. Buuri Divisional Police Commander, Joseph Asugo, said the soldiers died, after a vehicle they were travelling in, was involved in a road accident on the Meru-Isiolo highway. “The driver of the vehicle carrying the KDF officers collided head-one with an oncoming private car at Matunda area, killing the officers on the spot,’’ Asugo said. He said four other people, including a man, his wife and two children, who were in the private car, sustained injuries and were admitted at a nearby hospital. The commander said they had since launched investigations into the incident. According to the National Transport Safety Authority, an estimated 3,000 Kenyans die in road accidents annually in spite of concerted efforts by the state and the private sector to promote safety on the highways.
