Photos and reports circulating online, on Wednesday, evening suggest that the brainchild behind the unsettling recent serial killings in Port Harcourt, capital of Rivers State, has been unmasked. Among those who shared the photo was Ibim Semenitari, a seasoned journalist who was at various times Commissioner of Information in Rivers State and Acting Managing Director of  the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Mrs. Semenitari posted on her Facebook wall: “This is the face of the alleged serial killer in Port Harcourt, Rivers state from the CCTV video. Faceboook name: Gracious David West”. Another post (not by Mrs. Semenitari) threw more light on the alleged serial killer. It said: “This same Gracious David West was an ex militant and a renowned armed robber that was rehabilitated by Opm church.. The church even helped him to secure a job in Federal university of Technology, Owerri. He continued in perpetrating crime and he was subsequently declared wanted by the police in June 2018. He is now part of the serial killer syndicate responsible for the death of over 13 young females in Port Harcourt.. Indeed the lord disappointeth the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.” (News Express)
