Abuja – An actress has opened up on the reason why she can’t get married after her relationship crashed. Nollywood actress, Sylvia Ukaatu, has revealed in a chat that her only regret in life was taking a blood oath with a former lover when she was just 18. She said that’s the reason she can’t marry. The actress said:“It all started when I was 18 years old. I fell in love, deeply in love. I was so carried away at that tender age. I was lured into taking a blood oath with my then lover.I never knew the repercussions behind such move. I was young, naive and in love. We played along. I was happy. I was eager to settle down. Then love became sour. I tried to walk away.I begged to be freed but the guy refused, so I kept to myself and started living life to the fullest. Even when he travelled out of the country, I had so many failed relationships without knowing what was behind it. Suitors were coming, but on the day of introduction, they would cancel without explanation. I waited for many years for him to come back. But he never did. I desperately wanted to start a family, but that wasn’t forthcoming.I tried so many relationships but they all failed. The guy finally came back last year and we spoke at length. I told him we should break the oath if he’s no longer interested in marrying me, but he ignored me.Then, a few months ago, my brother called me and said I should go and search for my fiancé on Facebook, that the guy just got married. I quickly rushed to Facebook and checked. I was shocked to discover that truly he just got married, but I laughed it over. Now, I can still feel the pains deep inside my heart. I want to warn the young ones out there.Love is not enough for blood oath. The guy deceived and used me. I ignorantly allowed myself to be caged for years. Let the youths learn from my experience.” Source
