The election of the Dr Orji Uzor Kalu representing Abia North senatorial zone has been nullified by the second panel handling National and State House of Asembly election petitions in Abia State. In a unanimous judgement delivered by a member of the panel, Justice I.P.C Igwe, the panel also held that the petitioner had successfully proved his allegation of substantial non compliance with the guidelines on conduct of elections. The panel noted that since all parties were in agreement that elections took place peacefully in all parts of the senatorial zone, the first respondent, INEC, failed in its duty to ensure that all polling unit were duly recorded in the relevant ward and local government result sheets. The tribunal frowned at the exclusion of over thirty thousand votes from Arochukwu local government area alone without INEC giving a good reason for the development, noting that the figure was much higher than the ten thousand votes with which the second respondent, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu, was leading the petitioner. It therefore ordered supplementary elections in all the affected areas within ninety days and the results duly collated and winner announced. In a reaction, counsel to Senator Mao Ohuabunwa, Mr Mike Onyeka hailed the judgement, noting that it had heightened his confidence in the judiciary.
