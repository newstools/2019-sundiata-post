Addis Ababa – The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) on Friday confirmed two aid workers have been killed in Ethiopia’s Gambella regional state. The deceased aid workers were working for the US-based Action Against Hunger aid group. In a press statement, UNOCHA Resident Coordinator for Ethiopia, Steven Omamo, condemned the attack on an NGO vehicle on Wednesday that left two aid workers dead. “The aid workers were supporting a stabilisation centre which provides emergency nutritional support for complicated cases of acute malnutrition in a refugee camp in the area before their deaths. “I strongly condemn any attack on humanitarian workers bringing much needed humanitarian assistance to people in need in Ethiopia. “Attacks on aid workers in clearly marked humanitarian aid vehicles constitute a violation of International Humanitarian Law.’’ Omamo called on the Ethiopian government to secure areas of humanitarian operations and ensure the safety of aid workers. He further said he was confident that Ethiopian authorities would arrest and prosecute those responsible for the attack. So far, no group or individuals have claimed responsibility for the Wednesday attack on the aid workers. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), Ethiopia is host to more than 401,000 South Sudanese refugees, with most of them housed in refugee camps in Gambella regional state. Ethiopia is the second-largest host of South Sudanese refugees after Uganda. (Xinhua/NAN)
