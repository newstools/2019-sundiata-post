Controversial actress and mother of one, Angela Okorie has again attracted the wrath of her fans after she dressed in a provocative way. This isnâ€™t the first time Angela is being involved in a social media controversy and this will certainly not be the last.Â The public figure who has over 2.6 million followers on social media has a way of posting sultry contents about herself on Instagram to irk her followers and this later generates some sort of buzz of her. She was recently at one of the top hotels in Benin City, Edo State where she made a video of herself wearing an outfit that exposed her body parts.Â This caused an outrage on social media with many fans accusing her of engaging in prostitution. She has risen to the defence of herself as she continues to fight dirty on social media. Prostitution appears rife in Nollywood and this has been traced to the reason why the actresses are very wealthy while most of their male counterparts wallow in poverty.
