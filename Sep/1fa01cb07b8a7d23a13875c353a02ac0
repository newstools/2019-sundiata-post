Abuja (Sundiata Post) – There were confusions in the camp of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kogi state on Tuesday as one of the governorship aspirants, Dr Victor Adoji, denied stepping down from the contest. Adoji in a statement by Abdulahi Usman Adeiza, on behalf of the Dr Victor Adoji Campaign Group (DVACG), said the report of him quitting the race was false and baseless. There were reports that seven of the aspirants, including Adoji, had stepped down for a former governor of the state Capt Idris Wada, as the party goes to the primary. Adoji, however, said he was still very much in the race as he was convinced of coming out victorious to be the candidate of the party. The statement read, “We write to debunk the devilish and wicked news making round the social media of the decision of Dr Adoji stepping down for other candidates ahead of the Kogi PDP gubernatorial primaries which will kick start any moment. “This news is, of course, coming from other opponents who already are afraid of his personality and momentum and have brought up this fake news to confuse our convinced supporters. “We are gaining grounds, moving from Local Government to Local Government and our delegates are in love with us. We are very prepared for the Primaries and shall come out victorious at the end”.
