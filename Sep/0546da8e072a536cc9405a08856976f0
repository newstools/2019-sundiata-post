By Ngozi Njoku Lagos – An estate agent, Yemi Ogunsanwo, on Monday, appeared before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court, Lagos for allegedly defrauding an accommodation seeker of N200,000. Ogunsanwo, 56, who resides in Ketu area of  Lagos, is facing a two- count charge of obtaining money under false pretence and stealing. He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecutor, Insp Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on July 27 at Elebiju Street, Alapere Ketu. Ihiehie alleged that the accused collected the N200,000 from one Mr Fatai Sadiq on the pretence that he would rent a self contained room for him, a representation he knew was false. “All efforts by the complainant to get back his money proved unsuccessful as the defendant kept giving him excuses. “He reported the case to the police and the defendant was arrested,” the prosecutor said. The offence contravened Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that section 287 prescribes three years jail term for stealing, while section 314 attracts 15 years for individuals found guilty of obtaining money under false pretence. The magistrate, Mrs Ejiro Kubeinje, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N100,000 with two sureties in like sum. Kubeinje said that the sureties should be gainfully employed with evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She adjourned the case until Nov. 7.
