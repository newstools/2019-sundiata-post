Punch Metro reports that a man identified as Ojo Daniyan has been arrested by the men of the Ondo State Police Command for allegedly committing arson and murder. Daniyan allegedly set his wife, Dorcas, ablaze at Irese Road, Akure, Ondo State, last Saturday, September 14, 2019 at about 11pm while she was asleep. It was gathered that before the incident happened, the victim and her husband had had a disagreement over the proceeds of a land she had sold. This raised suspicion that the husband carried out the dastardly act. A source said a few hours before the incident, Daniyan brought home a keg of petrol; and that, some hours later, a fire started while he was in the room with the deceased. “When the fire started, it was one of the neighbours that perceived the smoke coming out from the room. “We rescued the woman and rushed her to the Federal Medical Centre, Owo , where she died,” the source said. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr. Femi Joseph, who spoke with our Correspondent on Friday, said the suspect was in Police custody and that the Command had commenced investigation into the matter. Joseph stated, “We have arrested the husband of the deceased, he is undergoing interrogation; but he is still denying his involvement in the crime, but circumstantial evidence is showing that he knows one or two things about the incident. “We have commenced investigation into the incident.”
