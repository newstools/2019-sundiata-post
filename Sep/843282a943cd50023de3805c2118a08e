•Prof. Akintoye By Sola Adeyemo IBADAN – A Yoruba leader and eminent historian, Prof. Banji Akintoye, has identified a cabal in the Presidency, who are bent on turning the Yoruba into slaves in Nigeria, as those behind the current travails of Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo. Akintoye, who observed this on Monday at the House of Chiefs, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, venue of the event marking the 126th anniversary of the Kiriji War (the civil war that engulfed Yoruba land from 1877 to 1893), said the smoke from the fire on Osinbajo was visible to all discerning Yoruba sons and daughters. The Yoruba leader, who was fielding questions from journalists after a special public lecture he delivered on ‘Yoruba: Today, Yesterday and Tomorrow,’ said: “There cannot be a smoke without fire, although we don’t know where the fire is, but we can see the smoke all around. “Yoruba are in a terrible situation in Nigeria because all the travails Osinbajo is going through show that we Yoruba are now like slaves in this country. So, we need to dig ourselves out of it. “We have been hearing a lot of negative things about the Vice President in the presidency, but the important thing is for us to find out exactly what is happening. “All we are hearing is just like a smoke, but we don’t know where the fire came from so whatever that might be happening to him now demonstrated that whoever that is not part of the people who control the Federal Government of  Nigeria, is only allowed in the Federal Government on surveillance. So, the person can be kicked out whenever they like. “There are people among those controlling the Federal Government of Nigeria who have a lot of heavy questions to answer but they are protected by the powers that be.” While the event was chaired by another renowned historian, Prof. Bolanle Awe, also in attendance were the General Secretary of the Committee, Prof. Anthony Kila; Chief Lekan Alabi and Chief Segun Odegbami, among others. (New Telegraph)
