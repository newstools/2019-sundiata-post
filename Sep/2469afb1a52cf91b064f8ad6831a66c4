By Onyekachi Eze Abuja (Sundiata Post)  –  The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) said the latest request by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) for the bank accounts of justices of the Supreme Court, was aimed at blackmailing the lord justices who are billed to hear the appeal filed against President Muhammadu Buhari’s election. The coalition also
noted another request by one of the security agencies to mobile
telecommunication companies to furnish it with  the phone log of the
apex court justices and other listed Nigerians from August 1, 2018 to
September 10, 2019. In a statement Sunday
by its spokesperson, Ikenga Ugochinyere, CUPP said the attempt to add some
members of the National Assembly did not hide the real intention of government. It observed that no
member of the executive arm of government was listed in the NIFU letter, and
wondered whether there was no corrupt persons among the members of executive. “We would not have
been so surprised by this latest government action since the same
government had earlier ordered a midnight raid on houses of some judges
and also removed a sitting Chief Justice of Nigeria in a most
controversial manner. “The same government
sent security agents to lay siege on the National Assembly with a view to
forcing a leadership change,” the coalition stated. The CUPP expressed concern that these directives to invade the privacy of the justices as guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution “is coming at a time the coalition presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, is approaching the Supreme Court to contest the judgment of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal.
