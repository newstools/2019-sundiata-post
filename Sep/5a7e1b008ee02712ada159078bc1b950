Big Brother Naija housemate, Tacha, clashed with fellow housemate, Frodd, at dinner. The housemates were treated to a feast by Pure Bliss. Tacha and Frodd got into a heated argument while sharing the treat as housemates bickered over who got what. They eventually settled their differences while having work-out routines. Tacha is presently in the bad books of many of her competitors who feel she is quite rude. Khafi, Mike, Seyi, Omashola and Tacha are up for eviction this week. Source
