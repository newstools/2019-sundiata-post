Moghalu while using the opportunity to shade politician, reminded Nigerians of how he promised them the kind of asurance Davido had given to Chioma but they failed to accept it. ”I warmly congratulate @iam_Davido on his engagement with Chioma his fiancée & wish them a happy life together. In 2018/19 I gave Nigerians #Assurance similar to the one Davido gave his queen. One day we will have leadership that assures our future. Something New, Different, Bold,” Moghalu tweeted. Source
