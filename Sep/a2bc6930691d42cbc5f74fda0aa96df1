The rapper further called on Nigerians to stop violent attacks on businesses in Nigeria. According to him, violence will not solve the problem but rather heightens it. “This a very difficult time for everyone but violence is never the answer. “Attacking people or vandalizing businesses in Nigeria will not solve the problem, but will rather make things worse. “We are hurting our own selves! Please,” Falz added. Source
