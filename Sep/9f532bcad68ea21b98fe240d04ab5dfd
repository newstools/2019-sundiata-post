Colombo – Sri Lanka’s ruling party named its presidential candidate on Thursday, ending a power struggle among the leadership ahead of the November elections, party officials said. The Housing Minister, Sajith Premadasa, 52, was named as the candidate of the UN Party (UNP) in a unanimous decision. He was named in spite of party leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announcing his intention to contest the election. The newly announced candidate is the son of former president Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was killed in a suicide bomb attack by Tamil rebels at a May Day rally in Colombo in 1993. Premadasa carried out a major public campaign to be chosen by the party as its candidate for election. His closest rival will be the country’s main opposition candidate, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. He is the younger brother of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the current opposition leader in parliament and former president of Sri Lanka. Mahinda Rajapaksa’s presidency included the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009, which marked the end of the 26-year minority ethnic conflict in the north and eastern parts of Sri Lanka. Some 15.9 million people are due to vote at the presidential elections on Nov. 16.
