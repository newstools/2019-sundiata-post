Ibrahim Abdulazeez Iseyin (Oyo state) – A member of the House of Representatives, Mr Shina Peller, on Friday, urged the leadership of the National Assembly to call for an emergency session to address the challenges of attacks on Nigerians in some parts of South Africa. The lawmaker, who spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Iseyin said that the attack was “condemnable and unspeakable. “The long standing relationship between Nigeria and South Africa must be protected and not be allowed to be destroyed by unscrupulous elements. “I have always been received very warmly in South Africa. So, I am sure that majority of their citizens do not feel this way about Nigerians, but their government certainly needs to make decisive actions,” he said. Peller, who disclosed that the Speaker of the House, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila, was equally disturbed by the development, expressed the hope that the National Assembly would reconvene soon. “This is not time for inflammatory remarks. We must all unite against criminals and criminalities anywhere and everywhere. We are all one in Africa,” he noted. (NAN)
