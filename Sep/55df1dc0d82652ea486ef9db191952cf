By Sani Abdulrahman Kaduna – A Sharia Court ll, sitting in Magajin Gari, Kaduna State, on Thursday dissolved a 3-year-old marriage between one Halima Sa’idu and her Customs officer husband, Nura Rilwanu, over irreconcilable differences. The Judge, Murtala Nasir, said that since the couple had mutually consented to the divorce, the court had no option than to grant their request of dissolution of their marriage as efforts at reconciling them had failed. The Judge gave custody of their 2-year-old child, to his mother and ordered Rilwanu to pay monthly feeding allowance of N15,000 effective from August 30. The Judge held that Rilwanu must enroll the child in school when he reaches age three and ordered him to send the child two packages of cloths with at least four pairs of clothes twice a year. “The mother should allow the father to speak to his son from about 8: a.m to 5: p.m whenever he wishes. “The mother should register the child in an hospital before seven days where the father will take responsibility exclusively,” the Judge said. Earlier, the defendant, Nura Rilwanu, a custom officer serving  in Lagos State, through his counsel, M.B Yusuf, told the court that his client wish to forfeit the N50,000 he paid as bride price. “We are praying the court to order the complainant to give us custody of the child when she remarries and should not restrict our access to the child whenever we wish to see him”, Yusuf requested of the court. Responding to the plaintiff ‘s counsel, Bukola Ajao, acquiesced to the defendant’s request but urged the court to compel the defendant allow his client pack her belongings still in his possession.
