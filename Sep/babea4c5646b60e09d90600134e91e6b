KADUNA – The Northern Governors Forum rose from an emergency meeting in Kaduna on Thursday formally adopting the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) as the most effective means of ending the decades long clashes between landowners and herdsmen, effectively putting an end to the controversial Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) plan proposed by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture.The NLTP is the blueprint that was put in place by the committee headed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Chairman of the forum, Governor Simon Lalong, who announced the development to journalists at the end of the meeting, said the plan lays out a clear path for modernising pastoral activities.He said the northern governors also resolved to continue to adopt a sustainable and holistic approach towards tackling the security challenges in the region. “On Agriculture, the Forum was well informed about the National Livestock Transformation Plan and its disparities with the RUGA plan. It is expected that the plan would ensure resettling and addressing the dislocated populations in the key conflict zones to enable them become part of the agricultural modernisation process. “The Forum, therefore, adopted the National Livestock Transformation Plan which lays out clear path for modernising pastoral activities and encouraged other states not included as pilot states to endeavour to join the plan,” Lalong said.
