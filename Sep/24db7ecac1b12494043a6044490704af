Mum-of-two Helena Broadbent was rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries after she fell from a moving car in Kiwi Retreat, a suburb in Melbourne, Australia. The 32-year-old sustained life-threatening injuries during the fall and was airlifted to hospital where she delivered her baby via emergency cesarean. She died a short time after. The infant was transferred to Royal Women’s Hospital and remains in critical condition. Police believe that a 35-year-old man known to Ms Broadbent had threatened to assault her before she fell from the moving car. According to neighbour Ivan Sucic, a man left Ms Broadbent and her partner’s house before he “jumped in the car, slammed the door when he went in.”He said he heard the pregnant woman scream, and assumed it was at the same man. Minutes later, he saw the couple’s two daughters standing out the front of the home and a man in a dark hoodie running form the scene. The two girls are reportedly staying with their grandmother. Source
