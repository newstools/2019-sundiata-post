By Gami Tadanyigbe Gwagwalada (FCT) – Prof. Abdul-Rasheed Na’Allah, the Vice-Chancellor, University of Abuja, FCT, has urged  the Federal Government to invest in infrastructure development to  boost agriculture and reduce  poverty in the country. Na’Allah made the call on Tuesday in Gwagwalada, during the 3rd Samuel Osaigbovo Obemudia Memorial Lecture entitled “Revolutionising Agriculture For A New National Economy in Nigeria.“ Represented by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Administration), Prof. Sani Adam, Na’Allah said the objective of the lecture was to make meaningful contributions to the development of the country and humanity at large. “It is our considered position that, agriculture is not for food security alone, but also a sector that should take over from the energy sector. “Agriculture should lead all other sectors in the new national economic recovery as we all desire for our dear country’s development. “The government should prioritise and invest critically in the agricultural sector to reduce poverty and boost the economy of the country,” he said. Mr Festus Osaigbovo, the Liaison Officer, Edo, said that adequate policies would improve multi-demensional links to agricultural development and modernisation of the economy. Osaigbovo said in order to witness large and increased yield per hectare and per person, required distinct changes in all aspects of agriculture in the country. “Restructuring agriculture connotes pricing of inputs, intermediate and market based pricing of the entire value chain to ensure productivity. “Agricultural modernisation requires appropriate market-based credit and exchange rates as basis for instituting meaningful agricultural development. “It takes all of these efforts to revolutionise our current economic structure and improve the economy for national development,” he said.
