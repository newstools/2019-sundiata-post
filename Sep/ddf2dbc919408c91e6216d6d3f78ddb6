Collins Nnabuife Abuja (Sundiata Post)  –  As reactions continue to trail the presidential tribunal judgement that upheld President Muhammadu Buhari’s election, a Civil Society Organisation, Nigeria Youth Organisation (NYO) has called on Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to jettison plans to appeal the judgement, saying he should rather join forces with the administration to improve the economy. The organisation in a statement by the national
president, Alhaji Abdullahi Wali, in Abuja, said Atiku should accept the
verdict if the tribunal in faith as only God gives power. “We urge Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to accept the verdict of the tribunal in good faith as it is only God that gives power to whomever he pleases and we equally call on him to team up with President Buhari as he focuses on the enormous and herculean task of re-engineering the nation, fixing the economy, creating jobs for teeming population of unemployed youths, tackling corruption and insecurity headlong for a secured and prosperous Nigeria state,” he said. He also explained that the judgment has further
reaffirmed the confidence Nigerians have in the ability of President Muhammadu
Buhari to lead the nation and their decisions to re-elect him again to take
Nigerians and Nigeria to the next level. He further noted that the judgment is a victory
for democracy, rule of law and all Nigeria masses and youth that troop out in
their millions to cast their vote and defend it for the President during the
2019 presidential election with this judgment Nigerian should eschew
partisanship and rally round the President in his sincere quest to reposition
Nigeria. “We equally wishes to use this medium to
congratulate the Judiciary and the panel of jurists that sat through the case
in delivering this thorough verdict that was based on Principle of law in
Nigeria. “This verdict has also vindicated the
Independent National Electoral Commission which declared President Buhari, as
the winner of the March 2019 Presidential Election in accordance with the
mandate freely express and willingly given by Nigerians,” he said.
