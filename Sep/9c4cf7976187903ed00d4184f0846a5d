Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has said that he called for the boycott of 2019 elections because he knew that President Muhammadu Buhari would rig the elections. Mr Kanu’s comments follow the judgement of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal on Wednesday which upheld President Buhari’s election and dismissed the petitions of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate in the election, Atiku Abubakar. Kanu, in a tweet on Thursday, said he warned Nigerians ahead of time. I warned you all but you would not listen. When they vetoed the Electoral Bill & proceeded to illegally sack Onnoghen, sensible people knew it was game over. I ordered a boycott because I knew dictatorships always rig elections. My Jan 29, 2019 tweet below is a polite reminder. pic.twitter.com/OMjZCtimUF “I warned you all but you would not listen.
