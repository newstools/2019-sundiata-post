Berlin – Former Bayern Munich great Sepp Maier has criticised an alleged agreement that Schalke goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel would join the Bundesliga champions in summer. He said this could lead to unrest and would not help the young player. Schalke have confirmed that the 23-year-old Nuebel would leave in summer. The Bild newspaper has reported that Nuebel has agreed to a five-year contract in Munich, where Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is first choice and team captain. Maier told Tuesday’s edition of Bild that the 33-year-old Neuer, who has a contract until 2021, would likely continue to play for another three or four years. He added that Bayern Munich have enough goalkeepers, such as back-up Sven Ulreich who has deputised on many occasions. “The next unrest will happen for sure, I can not imagine that Manuel will like this,” Meier said. The 1974 World Cup winner also said he did not understand the motives of Nuebel who has been first-choice at Schalke for a year. Maier pointed out that Nuebel would most likely be confined to the substitutes’ bench at Bayern Munich if a transfer happens. “Nuebel is much too good to be on the subs’ bench. He must play and he wants to play, not just wait and train for three years,” Maier said. Former national goalkeepers Bodo Illgner and Jens Lehmann were also critical but Toni Schumacher, who spent his final season in Munich, had a different view. “You go to Munich when Bayern call,” Schumacher said, adding it would not harm Nuebel if he spends a season on the subs’ bench.
