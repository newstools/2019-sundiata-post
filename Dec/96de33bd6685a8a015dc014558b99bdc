Riyadh – The Saudi Press Agency (SPA) on Wednesday reported that Rockets fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels have targeted a hospital in the South Western city of Jazan but no one was injured. According to SPA, spokesman of Jazan’s civil defence department said, the Houthis fired Katyusha rockets on Tuesday, targeting a hospital and other civilian facilities nearby. The attack left no casualties but damaged the walls surrounding the hospital, it added. The Houthis have claimed several missile and drone attacks into neighbouring Saudi Arabia in recent months, which they say is a response to attacks by the Saudi-led coalition fighting them since March 2015. The coastal city of Jazan, close to the Yemeni border, has previously been the target of missile attacks claimed by the Houthis, who said they target military and vital facilities. The coalition was formed to counter advances by the rebels towards the Yemeni government’s temporary seat in the southern city of Aden. The Houthis took over the capital Sana’a and other areas in late 2014. The devastating power struggle between the Saudi-backed government and the Iran-backed Houthis has left Yemen, already one of the Arab world’s poorest countries, with a hunger crisis and massive damage to infrastructure.
