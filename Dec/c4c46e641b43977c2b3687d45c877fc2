LAGOS – A 22-year old man, Friday Udeme, who was arrested for having s*x with a 15-year old girl in Lagos insisted that the victim was his lover and they had enjoyed s*x several times before they were caught. P.M.EXPRESS reports that Udeme told the Police that they enjoyed the romp and that was why both of them kept it to themselves before the girl’s parents later knew and reported to the Police. The incident happened at Amodu Bello Street, Papa Ashafa area of Agege, where they reside. They were said to have secretly been having s*x and hid it from the neighbours over a period. However, when the lovers were caught, the matter was reported to the Police and Udeme was arrested and later handed over to the Gender Section of the Police Command for further interrogation. The Police found the suspect culpable because of the age of the victim. The suspect was later charged before the Ogba Magistrates Court for defilement which attracts several years of imprisonment if he is tried and found guilty before the Court. The prosecutor, Supol Benson Emerhi, asked the Court to refer the matter to the DPP for advice since the matter involved a minor. The Presiding Magistrate, Mrs. O. Sule-Amzat, did not take his plea or grant him bail after the prosecutor moved the motion for the DPP’s advice. Udeme was remanded in prison custody pending the outcome of DPP’s advice. The matter may be transferred to the High Court if the DPP’s report finds Udeme culpable and recommends that he should be tried for defilement as alleged by the Police.
