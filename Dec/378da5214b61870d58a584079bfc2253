– The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar
Malami, has said that the he will not take unilateral decision without recourse
to the rule of law concerning the release of the Sahara Reporters Publisher,
Omoyele Sowore. Malami stated this in
response to Falan’s demand that he directs Department of State Service (DSS) to
release Omoyele Sowore from custody. The Minister who disclosed
this in a statement Monday night signed by his Special Assistant on Media, Umar
Gwandu, said such will amount to a unilateral decision as the case of the
#RevolutionNow protests convener and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare, was
still in court. Sowore’s lawyer, Femi Falana, had demanded that Malami take action on the continued detention of the two accused. His call followed Malami’s order to the DSS to hands-off the trial of the case to his office. But Malami said the
action doesn’t mean he could free Sowore at will. Malami said: “When
parties submit their issues for determination to a court of law, they lack
exclusivity of decision over such issues without recourse to the court.” “We remain guided by
the established tradition and will not take unilateral decision without
recourse to the rule of law,” he added. Sowore has remained in
detention following his re-arrest by operatives of DSS at the Federal High
Court in Abuja on December 6, 2019.
