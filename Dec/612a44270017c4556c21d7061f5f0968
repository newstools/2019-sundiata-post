Saudi Arabia – Anthony Joshua has highlighted the role of Islam in his life in the build-up to his victory over Andy Ruiz Jr. in Saudi Arabia on Saturday night. According to Independent UK, Joshua became a two-time world heavyweight champion with a unanimous points victory over Ruiz in an incredibly tense rematch. Ruiz stunned the world when he knocked out Joshua back in June, but this time around the Briton boxed sensibly behind his jab, outpointing the Mexican-American to reclaim his IBF, WBA and WBO titles. And after his victory, Joshua credited the role Islam has played in his life. “[It played a] big role,” Joshua said, when asked what role Islam plays in his life by Seconds Out.“My Uncles went to Mecca and prayed for me. So it plays a big role. If a Muslim man comes to me and wants to put his blessings upon me and pray for me, I’m going to respect that person.“If a Christian man, a Buddhist, a Jewish man came to me, I would appreciate their devotion to their religion.“And Islam is a great religion. It has helped a lot of people. So for my victory, of course there was a lot of Muslims praying for me, and a lot of my supporters who are Muslims praying for me, and it all leads into a positive direction. And thank God we got the victory.”
