Istanbul – The Turkish presidency on Monday sent a motion on deploying troops to Libya to parliament for approval, state news agency Anadolu reports.Lawmakers are expected to vote on the authorisation motion, which was signed by President Recep Erdogan, on Thursday in Istanbul.Recently, Erdogan said the vote would likely take place between Jan. 8 and 9.It is expected to pass, as Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has a majority in parliament along with its far right ally, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).Erdogan has said that the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli had requested Ankara to send its troops in the face of an offensive from rival forces.Lawmakers from the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) said they will oppose the motion, after a meeting with Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.CHP deputy chairman Unal Cevikoz said Turkey must give priority to a diplomatic solution in Libya.In November, Turkey and the GNA signed two controversial agreements, on military cooperation and delimiting maritime boundaries.Libya’s internationally recognised government is battling for power against a rival administration based in the east and led by Khalifa Haftar.
