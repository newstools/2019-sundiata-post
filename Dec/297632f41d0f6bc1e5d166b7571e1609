Tehran – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday said Iran’s resistance against U.S. pressures “will force Washington to change approach towards Tehran. “The Americans have no choice but to change the path they have been treading. “We will compel them to do so too through resistance and perseverance,” Rouhani made the remarks in Kuala Lumpur of Malaysia. He said that the U.S. maximum pressure campaign against his country would not last for a long time. “Washington’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and its subsequent imposition of anti-Iran sanctions have benefited no side,” Rouhani said. Iranian President noted that in the meantime, Iran has been able to turn the U.S. sanctions into opportunities through resistance. (Xinhua/NAN)
