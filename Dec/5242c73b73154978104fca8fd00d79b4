Department of State Security (DSS) has returned the Editor-In-Chief/Publisher of NewsDiary online, Danlami Nmodu back to his family. The DSS had asked Nmodu to report in its Abuja office for interrogation over a story published on the online platform over which a rejoinder was also published. The media world, especially the online publishers under the auspices of Guild of Corporate Online Publishers (GOCOP) panicked when the news of the invitation of the editor in chief filtered in. However, Nmodu later sent a message across to his colleagues that he had been asked to go back home to enjoy his freedom. He wrote: “I want to thank all of you for your prayers. I have been allowed to leave DSS HQ after interaction on the story. Thank you all.”
