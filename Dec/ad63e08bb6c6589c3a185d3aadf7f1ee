By Yemi Adeleye Lagos – The Zone RS2 Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), comprising Ogun and Lagos States, on Tuesday in Lagos, urged travellers to always caution erring drivers. The Zonal Commanding Officer, Mr Samuel Obayemi, who gave this advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said travellers should not sleep and be passive while on board. According to him, travellers during the season must join hands with the FRSC officials to bring down road traffic crashes and fatalities. The FRSC commander said: “Passengers should not be allowed to be driven to death. Most of our passengers are passive while on board from one point to the other’’. “As somebody, who has paid commercial drivers to move from one place to another, there is the need for you to be on the look out on the way the driver is driving’’. The FRSC commander said that commuters must be cautioning their drivers anytime they noticed dangerous overtaking, overloading and speeding on the highways. He urged passengers to use the free toll lines to report erring and recalcitrant drivers, especially to marshals and officers on the highways. Obayemi said that the public should take note of the FRSC Emergency Toll Free line 122 or 0700CALL as well as the CUGs of Commanding Officers on the FRSC’s official websites in case of emergencies. The commander, who urged motorists to be patient and adhere to speed limit on the road, said that long distance journey drivers must rest at regular intervals to guide against stress and fatigue capable of causing accidents.
