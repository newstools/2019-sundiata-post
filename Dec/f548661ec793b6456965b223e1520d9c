Popular Nollywood actor, IK Ogbonna, has turned down a â€˜toto-rial classâ€™ from a female fan on Instagram.Â It happened that the actor shared a video of Burna Boy along with some guys dancing and he said he desperately wants to learn the dance step. He added that he is ready to pay if need be.Â Well, a female follower of the actor accepted the offer but wanted some thing more.Â While reacting to the actorâ€™s post the female fan asked him to come forward for a tutorial which was intentionally misspelt as toto-rial. The actor then replied swiftly that he does not want toto-rial clarifying that he wants only a dance practice. See their exchange below:  I wonâ€™t lie I want to learn this dance â€¦ Biko I will pay ðŸ’° A post shared by  Ikechukwu Mitchel Ogbonna ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ (@ikogbonna) on Dec 19, 2019 at 7:23am PST Source
