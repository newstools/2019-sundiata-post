Lagos â€“ Cardi B wore the signature Nigerian green-white as she thrilled her fans in Lagos Saturday night. Her colour choice at Livespot X Festival at Eko Atlantic further reinforced some of her positive views about Nigeria, that she has likened to her dadâ€™s Dominican Republic. Some commenters said the American rapper has demonstrated that she is proud of Nigeria, even more than some Nigerian singers. And whatâ€™s more, she and her dancers put up an electrifying performance.
