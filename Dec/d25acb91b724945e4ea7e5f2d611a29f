Bangkok – The coronation of Chief Maha Vajiralongkorn would be officially concluded on Thursday with an elaborate parade of boats on Bangkok’s main river. The Royal Barge Procession involved 2,200 oarsmen who were expected to paddle 52 barges along the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok. It is the last phase of Vajiralongkorn’s coronation after he was officially crowned in a May ceremony. Vajiralongkorn was expected to sit with his new Queen Suthida on the largest barge that features a figurehead shaped as a mystical swan. Suthida was named queen in May just days before Vajiralongkorn was crowned. According to a palace statement, Vajiralongkorn also named an official consort in July but dismissed her three months later for showing a lack of loyalty and making efforts to elevate her status to that of Suthida’s. The royal barge procession was initially scheduled to take place in October but was postponed to Thursday. The ceremony, also called the Royal Procession by Water, is meant to reflect old Thai ways of life that historically used boats as a major means of transportation. The traditional ceremony was supposed to provide Thais with a rare chance to catch a glimpse of their new monarch. However, since inheriting the throne from his late father Bhumibol Adulyadej, Vajiralongkorn had sought greater control over the monarchy’s finances and placed more army units under his direct command. Vajiralongkorn reportedly spent the major part of his life in Germany where he had a villa on Lake Starnberg in Munich. Thailand’s monarchy is protected by strict lese-majesty laws under which critical commentary of the monarch is punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
