 ABUJA – The Department of State Services (DSS) has debunked claims that one of their personnel was responsible for the alleged killing of a man in Alor community of Anambra State, on Christmas Day. There were reports that an operative of the DSS attached to a prominent man in the community, had shot at a cow, which had attempted an escape. However, it turned out to be a missed target, as the bullet was said to have hit certain Mr. Nnaemaka Nnabuenyi, who died on the spot. But, the DSS has said preliminary enquiry indicated that a member of a local vigilante group may have been responsible for the tragic incident. Spokesperson for the DSS, Dr. Peter Afunanya, who offered the clarification in a statement, Friday, maintained that handling of arms in the Service was guided by strict control procedures and measures. It was against the backdrop, that he said no operative could have fired such a fatal shot, under such circumstance. “The attention of the Department of State Services (DSS) has been drawn to a false story making the round that its staff, on 25th December, 2019, at Alor Community, Anambra State ‘while targeting a cow that was running away’, shot a native instead,” Afunanya said. He regretted that some media platforms had “carried this erroneous story”, insisting that, “it is not true that a DSS operative was responsible for this act.” (New Telegraph)
