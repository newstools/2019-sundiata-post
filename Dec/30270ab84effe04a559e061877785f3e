By Adebosoyin Akinyemi Lagos – An Ebute Meta Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Monday granted bail to a 29-year-old man, Abe Kayode charged with conspiracy, murder and membership of a secret cult. Chief Magistrate T.J. Agbona granted Kayode bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties, after his arraignment by the police. Agbona granted the bail following a request by the defendant’s counsel, Mrs O. B. Otighi. He ordered that the case file should be forwarded to the state Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) for advice, and adjourned the case to Jan. 23, for mention. Otighi had prayed the court to grant her client bail to enable more investigations into the case and pending the advice of the DPP. The police charged Kayode with conspiracy to commit murder, murder and membership of a secret cult, contrary to Section 233, 222 and 41 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The police charged the defendant with the murder of one Mr Oloyo Adewunmi at 9:00p.m. on Nov. 18 at Lekki, lagos State. The Investigating Police Officer (IPO), Mr Shola Adeniyi, however, said that the defendant and the deceased were attacked by Aiye confraternity and the deceased was shot on the chest. The IPO told the court that because of the inconsistency in the defendant’s statement, the deceased’s brother thought that the defendant murdered the deceased. The Prosecutor, Insp. Raphael Donney, had requested the court to remand the defendant. (NAN)
