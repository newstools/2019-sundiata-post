 •Late Senator Uwajumogu More facts have emerged on how the Senator representing Imo North Senatorial District, Rt. Hon. Benjamin Uwajumogu, died. As earlier reported by Sundiata Post and some other media, Uwajumogu, a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), died earlier today, Wednesday, December 18, 2019 in his Apo residence in the Nigerian capital. A former Speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly, he was aged 51. A close friend of Uwajumogu this evening told News Express of the circumstances surrounding his sudden death. The source said: “He had a habit of coming downstairs between 7:30 and 8am. This morning, his sister and other family members waited in vain for him to come downstairs as usual. “They became apprehensive, went upstairs, knocked on the door and repeatedly called his name but there was no answer. “When they eventually gained entry, they found him slumped in the bathroom. He was rushed to a nearby hospital but was confirmed dead on arrival.” The source described Uwajumogu’s death as tragic and shocking, saying that there was no indication that he was sick when they last met. “He looked full of life when we recently met,” the source said. “We exchanged banters and he told me that he wanted to settle down and focus on his job as a Senator after the hard battle he fought to actualise his mandate.”
