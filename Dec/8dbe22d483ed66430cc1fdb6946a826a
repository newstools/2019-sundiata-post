By Masara Kim  Suspected kidnappers on Sunday invaded the home of a renowned broadcast journalist, Mr. Dan Kwada, located 500mtrs to the Plateau State Government House, Little Rayfield, Jos. Armed with assorted guns of various capacities, the kidnappers, tied up Mr. Kwada’s security man after forcefully gaining access into the house at about 8pm. Their target was unknown but the AIT reporter was out of town when they invaded, it was learnt. Attempts by his wife to reach government securities failed, but the invaders fled when she rang an emergency alarm. “They kept firing in the air as they retreated, but still kidnapped an 11year-old girl few blocks away,” Mr. Kwada told MK news. It was the third kidnap incident in the Little Rayfield-Gura Topp street in six weeks. A lawyer and military residents had fallen victims last month, MK gathers. Despite its proximity to the State Government House, the street, residents say, has witnessed series of other crimes of late, often with no security intervention. It used to be the access route to the Government House but the nearest Police outpost is over 1000mtrs away. Officials recently installed streetlights across the State capital but none was installed in the street. Observers blame the neglect on the protracted political rivalry between the present Governor, Simon Lalong and his predecessor, Jonah Jang. The ex-governor is said to mostly use the street to get to his house, some 3kms away.
