Brighton (UK ) – Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Aaron Mooy both broke their goalscoring ducks for Brighton and Hove Albion who returned to winning ways with a 2-0 home win over Bournemouth on Saturday. Jahanbakhsh, who was given his first start of the season, repaid Graham Potter’s faith in the midfielder for the English Premier League (EPL) fixture. He scored as early as the third minute with a fierce, low strike into the far corner. Bournemouth had a couple of chances to equalise in the first half. But Brighton defenders Dan Burn and Lewis Dunk were on hand to make last-ditch blocks as the home side went into the break 1-0 up. Brighton right back Dan Burn then thought he had scored his first goal for his club, too. That was when he put the ball in the back of the net during a scramble in the box. However, VAR disallowed it for a marginal offside call when the set-piece was taken. Mooy capped a man-of-the-match performance by doubling Brighton’s lead in the 79th minute when he latched on to Leandro Trossard’s pass. He took two sublime touches to set himself up for a curling shot that beat goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. The win, Brighton’s first at home in four games, lifted them up to 13th in the standings. Bournemouth remained in 16th —- two points above the relegation zone —-after their seventh loss in nine games.(Reuters/NAN)
