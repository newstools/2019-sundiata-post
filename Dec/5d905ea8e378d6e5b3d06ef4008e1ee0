By Uchenna Inya ABAKALIKI â€“ A 17-year-old boy, Ojoko Friday of Ndinwampfu village, Igbeagu community, in Izzi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, has been beheaded by suspected warlords while coming back from farm in the area. The deceased was a SS3 student of Noble Secondary School Ndiechi Igbeagu in the local government. The people of Igbegu community and their neighbouring Ukelle, Yala Local Government Area of Cross River State have been at war over boundary matters with many killed and property worth millions of naira destroyed. But recently, youths from both communities came together to make peace after several failed efforts by government and the security agencies to put the conflict under control. Unfortunately, the peace moves may now have been threatened sequel to the beheading of the school boy. The village head, John Ede said on that fateful day, Master Friday Ojoko was coming back from the farm with his parents and siblings on December 7 when the unknown assailants ambushed them.
