By Chinedu Adonu Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Group under the auspices Team of Detecting Agency for Government Reform Initiative, TDAGRI, has advocated for registration of prostitution work as a business in Nigeria. The leader of
the group, Hon, Nebeck Eziora made this proposal in a press release titled,
“Nigeria in the Era of New Political Invention” stressing that prostitution
should be recognised and registered as a business for it to serve as an extra
revenue earner for the country. While regretting
what he called, general interlocutory indecency exposure caused by
prostitution, he also suggested for a law to regulate prostitution activities
in the country. Eziora also
prescribed a number of other ways to regulate, including that: whoever wishes
to be a prostitute shall obtain a renewable form from Cooperate Affairs
Commission, or any other agency, as may be determined by government, with three
referees including Traditional ruler of her community, her village head and
Parent, among others. According to
Hon, Eziora, a copy of proposed bill has been forwarded to National Assembly
for consideration. “The team of
Detecting Agency For Government Reform Initiative led by Hon, Nebeck Eziora
from Nkwe in Awgu Local Government Area, Enugu State proposed for consistory
court before the National Law Maker. “The
establishment of the law will checkmate general interlocutory indecency
exposure prostitution in Nigeria and it will become a registered business. “Prostitution
does worse than stealing but prostitutes say that prostitution is better than
stealing. “A new law shall provide requirement that can qualify prostitution works in Nigeria”, he said. Culled from Vanguard
