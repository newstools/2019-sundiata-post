A Nigerian woman has been accused of absconding with the money contributed to her as Ajo after she used it to organize her wedding. Ajo is a contributory thrift saving scheme among a group of people. It means that a group of people come together to each put an agreed amount of money into savings each month, then at the end of every month, someone in the group then takes all the money saved for that month, which is subsequently rotated among all the group members throughout the period of the monthly contribution. According to an Instagram user, @finest001 who shared the sad story, the accused lady failed to pay the money despite being given enough time to do so. When confronted, she decided to block one of those that complained to her on social media. @finest001 while sharing the story wrote: “Hi everybody please I don’t do this but this lady right here deserves it all after collecting ajor to do wedding now she refuse to pay back people’s money 5M have giving her enough time to pay back up till now Tosin (Adebayo deborah olusanya) refuse to pay and blocked me good Nigerian e shanumi 😭😭😫😫😫🙏🏻this is people’s money @mrsnefa @nefawears I called her hubby,sister in law sent a message to them all to help me beg.
