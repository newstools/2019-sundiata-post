By Ijeoma Okigbo Abuja – Officials of the International Shooting Sports Federation (ISSF) will visit Nigeria before the end of January 2020, Lonsdale Adeoye, president of the Nigeria Shooting Sport Federation (NSSF), said on Friday. Adeoye told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja that the visit by the international body would involve an inspection of facilities which would help facilitate the provision of more equipment. “An official of the ISSF is currently on a tour of some African countries and will visit Nigeria before the end of January 2020. “They will also inspect the facilities we have and hopefully provide us with more. We are expecting them anytime soon,’’ he said. The retired Army Brig.-Gen. said the NSSF was also advocating for the creation of the continental Shooting Para-Sport Association secretariat in Nigeria. Adeoye said this was necessary due to the high number of shooting para-sport athletes in the country. (NAN)
