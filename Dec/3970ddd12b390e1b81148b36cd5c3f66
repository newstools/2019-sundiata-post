By David Adeoye Ibadan – Mrs Dolapo Dosunmu, the Oyo State Director of the National Orientation Agency(NOA), has implored Nigerians to imbibe the spirit of unity in order to promote peaceful coexistence.

The NOA director spoke on Thursday in Ibadan during the 2019 National Prayer/ Christmas Carol organised by the agency. According  to her, Nigeria is passing through a troubling time in the security and economic spheres. She, however, expressed optimism that the challenges would be over soon. ” I have no doubt that God in whom we put our hopes will move us out of the woods and replenish us with all good things of life both as individuals and as a nation.. “While it is a common knowledge that our beloved country is trying to tide over its challenges at this defining moment, let us be assured that they are not insurmountable, ” she stated. The director further called on parents and guardians to raise their children and wards according to “God’s word and not the world’s wisdom.” In her remarks,  the wife of a former governor of Oyo State, Mutiat Ladoja, urged Nigerians, especially the rich in the society, to always remember the poor. She emphasised that giving the less privileged a sense of belonging was an act of godliness and implored Nigerians to endeavor doing what would be beneficial to mankind.
