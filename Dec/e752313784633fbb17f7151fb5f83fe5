By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Nigerian military has revealed why
Dapchi schoolgirl, Leah Sharibu and some aid workers abducted by Boko Haram
have not been rescued. Acting
Director Defence Information, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu disclosed that
those abducted by Boko Haram in the Northeast have not been rescued because
troops are cautious not to put their lives in danger. Nwachukwu
made the disclosure while addressing journalists in Abuja during the Defence
Headquarters Coordinated Joint Operations. The acting
director also stated that Boko Haram terrorists only used the abductions to
raise funds to support their illicit activities. Nwachukwu,
however, assured that troops would not relent until they rescue all those held
captive. According to
Nwachukwu: “Troops of operation Lafiya Dole troops have been treading
cautiously because these people are all in the hands of the terrorists and any
reckless move may result in their annihilation by the terrorists just to ward
off the troops. “It is a very
complex and risky operation but the troops are working day and night to ensure
that they are rescued”. Sharibu was
among the over 100 students kidnapped by the terrorists at the Government
Girls’ Science and Technical College Dapchi,Yobe State, on February 19 2018. The terrorist sect,
however, refused to release Sharibu after setting others free due to her
refusal to denounce her Christian faith.
