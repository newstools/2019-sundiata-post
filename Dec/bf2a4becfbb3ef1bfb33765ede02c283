Popular social media influencer and former musician, Tunde Ednut, says most of the ladies who say they canâ€™t date a broke guy have broke fathers. Speaking via his official Instagram page, Ednut added that any lady who dates a guy because of his financial status is not different from a prostitute. He cautioned ladies with such thought, adding that most rich men today started their journey from somewhere.
