Ilorin – A Kwara state High Court sitting in Ilorin on Monday has convicted one Enoch Oluyode to six months imprisonment for offences bordering on internet fraud and other related frauds. The presiding judge, Mahmood Abdulgafar, sentenced Oluyode after finding him guilty of the one count (amended) charge levelled against him. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Ilorin Zonal office secured the conviction of Oluyode. “That you, Enoch Oluyode (Alias: John Donnna) sometime in October attempted to cheat by impersonation, when you pretended to be one John Donnna, a white Caucasian, via Gmail account: johndonna777@gmail.com “In that guise, communicated with one Colin Wilson through ‘Hangout with Colin Wilson’, a representation you knew to be false. “Thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 95 of the Penal Code and punishable under Section 324 of the same law,” the one-count charge read in part. The convict had earlier pleaded not guilty during his arraignment, but later entered into a plea bargain agreement with the EFCC. Delivering judgment on the matter, Justice Abdulgafar said the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. He ordered that phone recovered from the suspect be forfeited to the Federal Government, while the sentence is without an option of fine.
