According to the Igbo apex socio-cultural organisation, respecting the existing zoning formula which has produced many governors including the present one is the best way to sustaining peace in the state and reduce high cost of elections. The Ohaneze through its state chairman, Mr. Damain Okeke-Ogene, made the call at a ceremony to mark the third anniversary of the present officers of the organisation held at Nakan, Orumba North local government area. Ogene said, if all political parties pick their candidates from Anambra South, it would further consolidate the gains of zoning formula as a permanent policy in Anambra political system. He called on governor Willie Obiano to support the policy as a beneficiary of the arrangement to peacefully produce the next governor from Anambra South. “We have no doubt that governor Obiano as beneficiary of the arrangement will support the shift of power to Anambra South senatorial district,” he said. According to Ogene, zoning arrangement has brought stability to the political system of the state and has equally reduced cost of elections, especially when compared to what is happening in other states of the federation. He said the zoning has the support of the traditional rulers, women and youth organisations as well as town unions in the state and must be sustained. “With the victory of Governor Willie Obiano in the November 2017 governorship election, Anambra North has taken its eight years slot. The state is warming up for another gubernatorial election in 2021 and the slot will move to Anambra South for the next uninterrupted eight years,” he stated. (Daily Trust)
