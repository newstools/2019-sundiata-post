Kuwait City – Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on Tuesday signed agreements to divide the Neutral Zone between the two countries, the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported. “The agreements were inked by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Ahmad Nasser Al-Mohammad Al-Sabah and Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud,’’ KUNA said. Meanwhile, a memorandum of understanding to resume joint oil production along the border was signed by the Kuwaiti oil minister and the Saudi energy minister. Both sides commended the deals as a landmark achievement. The Neutral Zone is an area of 5,770 square km along the Saudi-Kuwaiti border. The two countries suspended production of the jointly run oil fields Khafji and Wafra in the zone over four years ago, a move that cut the global daily oil supply by some 500,000 barrels or 0.5 per cent.
