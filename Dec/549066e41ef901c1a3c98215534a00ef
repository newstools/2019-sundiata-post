The magistrate, Mrs A.M Olumide-Fusika, gave the order after the defendant, who was charged with stealing, pleaded guilty to the charge. She adjourned the case until Dec. 30 for facts and sentence. The prosecutor, Insp Ben Ekundayo, earlier told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Dec. 11 at 8 p.m. at Obalende South West, Ikoyi, Lagos.
