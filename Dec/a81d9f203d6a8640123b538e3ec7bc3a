•Duncan Mighty WERRI – The Imo State Police Command has said that music star, Duncan Mighty, earlier reported to have been abducted by gunmen, was arrested by the command over allegation of fraud following a petition written to the police.According to a statement signed by the Police Public Relations Officer, Ikeokwu Godson Orlando, a Superintendent of Police, investigation into the fraud is on-going.The statement said the fraud had to do with a contract Duncan Mighty entered with the Imo State Government during the tenure of Ex-Governor Rochas Okorocha and which the music star never executed. According to the statement, when he was asked to refund the money he allegedly collected, he agreed but up till the time of his arrest early Saturday morning (today) Duncan Mighty had not refunded the money.The full statement reads: ARREST OF DUNCAN MIGHTY OVER A CASE OF FRAUD TODAY 14/12/19 operatives of the command arrested popular music artist DUNCAN MIGHTY on an allegation of FRAUD.This followed a petition written by an upcoming rap artist M2, who claimed that the Imo State Government led by Owelle Rochas Okorocha, through the office of the SA on Entertainment, entered into a deal with DUNCAN MIGHTY to manage, promote, arrange collaboration with other top artists and sign M2 under YOUNG WEALTH record label owned by Duncan Mighty. As a result an agreement was reached with a fee of ELEVEN MILLION NAIRA (N11,000,000) was paid to him. However, since collecting the payment he refused to fulfill his own part of the deal.Sequel to the petition, the artist was arrested, and he affirmed having such an agreement and collecting the fund, but said he can only refund the money if the contract is terminated, he was then released on bail on self recognition. Consequently, a letter was reviewed by the representative of the former Governor, terminating the contract to enable him refund the money, and since then he absconded, and all efforts made to reach him proved abortive.In view of the above, a warrant of arrest was issued that led to his arrest at the early hours of this morning.SP IKEOKWU GODSON ORLANDOPOLICE PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICERFOR:THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICEIMO STATE POLICE COMMAND
