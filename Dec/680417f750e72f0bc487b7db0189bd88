As a convict, he has lost the right of presumption of innocence guaranteed under section 36 of the 1999 Constitution as amended. If the Court of Appeal upholds his appeal against the sentence and conviction in the Federal High Court, he regains his freedom and the conviction stands quashed in the eyes of the law. If the Court of Appeal dismisses his appeal, he continues to serve the sentence and is also entitled to proceed upstairs on a further appeal to the Supreme Court. (i) if he dies while serving the sentence and before the expiration of the term of the 9th Senate imto which he was elected. (i) If under the circumstances clearly prescribed in section 69 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria as amended, he is recalled as a Senator by his constituents. A recall process is tedious anyway but but it is a legal option. (ii) If under section 68(f) of the 1999 Constitution as amended, his seat as Senator is declared vacant by the Senate President on the ground that he is unable to attend legislative sittings for a minimum period allowed by the Nigerian constitution. In invoking this power, the Senate President must be mindful of the caveat erected under section 68(3) of the 1999 Constitution as amended dealing with absence “without just cause.” Don’t do the crime, if you can’t do the time. •Obiaraeri is a professor of law
