By Gabriel Agbeja Abuja – The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) has predicted poor visibility over most parts with dust haze conditions of visibility range of 2km to 5km over northern and central states on Saturday. NiMet’s weather outlook on Friday in Abuja further predicted likely early morning mist and fog over coastal belt within the forecast period. “For Northern region, dust haze condition with visibility range of 2 to 5km is expected over this region throughout the forecast period. “ Day and night temperatures are expected to be 28 to 35 degree Celsius and 13 to 22 degree Celsius respectively. “ For central states, dust haze conditions with visibility range of 2 to 5km are expected to prevail over the region throughout the forecast period. “ Day and night temperatures are expected to be in the range of 27 to 36 degree Celsius and 12 to 19 degree Celsius respectively, “ it said. According to the agency, hazy conditions are anticipated over the inland cities of southern states within the forecast period with possibilities of early morning mist and fog over the coastal belts. NiMet envisaged today and night temperatures of the region to be 32 to 36 degree Celsius and 17 to 25 degree Celsius, respectively. Mist is simply the atmospheric phenomenon that is formed by tiny vapour which gets suspended in the atmosphere on the surface of the Earth which causes errors in visibility. It is much lighter when compared to fog which is much thicker and denser. Mist also lasts for a shorter duration compared to fog, it is also wet particles but haze is dry particles. ( NAN)
