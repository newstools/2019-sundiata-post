By Oboh Linus Lafia – An NGO, Save Humanity Advocate of Nigeria (SHAN), has called for more attention to rural dwellers in the sharing of democracy dividends so as to give them a sense of belonging. Mr Ori Patrick, President and Founder of the NGO, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Friday in Lafia. “The people at the grassroots deserve a better deal from their representatives because they give a bulk of the votes. “The people at the grassroots are the pillars of democracy, but they are always neglected by people they have voted into offices. Such neglect is not good. “It is these poor rural dwellers that bear the brunt of poor representation and unfavourable policies of government. Such situation plungs them into abject poverty,” he fumed. He decried the absence of jobs and basic social amenities such as electricity, good roads and water which, he said, had slowed down economic activities at the grassroot. He said that SHAN was established as an advocacy group and mouth piece for the people at the grassroots in order to hold their leaders and representatives accountable. According to him, the group has facilitated scholarships and grants from Unique Foundation for 350 indigent students in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions. “We have engaged and interfaced with some NGOs to facilitate grants and scholarship for grassroots people to boost their small scale business. “Our sole goal is to save and lift the people from abject poverty by standing as a bridge and a voice that will link them with the realities of life,’’ he said.
