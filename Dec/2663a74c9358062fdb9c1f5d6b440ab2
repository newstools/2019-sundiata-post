The Biafra Nations Youth League (BNYL) has condemned the attack on former President Goodluck Jonathan’s residence by unknown gunmen on Tuesday. Reacting to the attack in a statement issued later yesterday, the Chief Press Secretary of the group, Richard Odung, said that youths in Bayelsa have decided to allow themselves to be used for politics while wondering why there is always a do-or-die approach to politics in the Niger Delta, especially in Bayelsa State. The group suspected that the loss of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) which Jonathan was accused of sabotaging led to the attack. The BNYL Spokesman said: “I think it is the suspicion that Jonathan sold his party out to APC when he visited Buhari that is leading to this nonsense some of our youths who have decided to allow themselves to be used as political thugs.” He hinted on the reasons the Niger Delta have not been able to progress in terms of development and unity enhancement, saying: “To us, we feel that lack of understanding of what politics is all about is why we cannot record progress and unity in the South-South, in 2019 they were ready to die for Jonathan, but today they are after him, Politicians knows where they meet, they create problems for personal interests.” Odung also drew the attention of the group that threatened the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) over attack on Chibuike Amaechi, adding: “The group which called itself Concerned Niger Delta Group should first educate themselves, unite their people before coming out publicly to exhibit their stupidity. “The truth is that some of our South-South politicians especially in riverine Rivers State and Bayelsa are using these their political militants disguising as freedom fighters to haunt themselves for selfish moves.” (News Express)
