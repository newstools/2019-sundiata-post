Two suspects, who attacked the Managing Director of Maersk Nigeria Limited, Gildas Tahouo Tahouo and killed his wife, Benedicta, have given reasons for robbing their boss leading to the death of his wife. A report by PM Express revealed that the incident happened at Lugard Avenue, Ikoyi area of Lagos, where the victims reside with their family. The suspects, Olamide Goke and Ade Akanbi, have been arrested and detained at the Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, SCIID, Panti, Yaba, Lagos where they were being interrogated. The suspects have confessed and revealed that they decided to rob the family because they had begged them for money in the past but they refused. Hence, they conspired and attacked the couple which eventually led to the death of the wife. Gilders was stabbed along with his wife but the wife was unlucky as she died from the injuries while Mr. Gilders, a Cameroonian, who operates an international shipping company alongside his Hungarian wife, Benedicta was badly injured and rushed to an undisclosed hospital where he is being treated. The main suspect, Goke, an electrician at Lugard Avenue, Ikoyi, where Gilders resides, had tricked the couple to gain access into their premises before they struck. But they met their waterloo when the Lagos Police Boss, Hakeem Odumosu, led a team of officers to the scene of the robbery and arrested two suspects. The suspects will be charged to Court after the conclusion of investigations, for murder which attracts life imprisonment if they are tried and found guilty before the Court for the alleged offence.
