Lusaka – Zambian Vice-President Inonge Wina said on Friday that plans for the re-launch of the national airline were still active. The Zambian vice-president said the government was determined to ensure that the national airline was re-launched. Speaking in parliament while answering questions from lawmakers who wanted to know the current situation with regard to the launch of the national airline, the vice-president said the government was sorting out technicalities before launching the airline. Some stakeholders have asked the government to halt plans for the re-launch of the national airline until the country’s economy improves. Earlier, the Centre for Trade Policy and Development, a local trade and development think-tank, advised the government to halt the re-launch of the airline due to the current financial constraints the country was facing and the struggling economy. Zambia has had no national airline since 1994 when its airline, Zambia Airways, was liquidated. In 2018, the government entered into a partnership with Ethiopian Airlines for the commencement of the national airline for Zambia. (Xinhua/NAN)
