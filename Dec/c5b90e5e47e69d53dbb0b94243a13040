In a chat with Inside Nollywood, Ms. Elom warned those who are guilty to desist from the act or face the consequences. “Whatsoever a man soweth so shall he reap and whatever goes around comes around!

It is good to add another chapter in your life but I just wish time could slow down because there are so many things I would like to achieve before I turn 30. I am also very thankful for what I have achieved and accomplished at this age. I have learnt a lot too; to be more patient, tolerable and not give a reaction to every situation. In 2019, I found love. I learned to invest more and live unapologetically. I have also found happiness and peace of mind,” she added.
