Police PR officer, Dolapo Badmus has finally unveiled her daughter’s face. Recall that she recently gave birth to a baby girl and has taken to instagram to announce the good news to the world. In her words: “I faced my fear and my fear feared me! My baby Anike Aliona with her natural lace wig….she’s the latest addition to my family! Does she really look like me?!”. The beautiful and elegant looking police officer who is the zone 2 police public relations officer (PPRO) is well known for condemning both fraudster and whoever supports fraud. She’s also popular for dissing Naira Marley in the most subtle way. Some time ago, she took to Instagram to state that the only “Naira” she knows that exists and stands legal is the Nigerian currency, and that any other thing that has the “Naira” attached to it is fake. She just welcomed a baby girl and friends have taken to instagram to celebrate her on the birth of her daughter.
