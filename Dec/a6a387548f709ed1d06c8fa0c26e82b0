By Olajide Idowu Ilesa (Osun) – A cleric and Grand Mufti of Yorubaland, Abdullateef Adekilekun, has advised Muslim faithful to uphold the tenets of Islam rather than incite violence against adherents of other religions. Adekilekun spoke at the 26th annual National Islamic Training Programme organised by the Muslim Congress in Ilesa, Osun. According to him, whosoever is inciting Muslims against others to spark religious intolerance is not a real believer. He said that Muslims should not attack people of other religions but extend friendship and love to them for development and peace in the country. The grand mufti, who spoke on the theme, “The Muslim Family, Fortifying the Structure,” described the family as the foundation of every society. “Building a strong family is equal to building a solid society; participants must train their children in strong Islamic teachings,’’ he said. Dr Lukman AbdulRaheem, the President of the Muslim Congress, said that participants drawn from Oyo, Osun, Ondo and Kwara were expected to implement knowledge gathered from the training to contribute to national development. “Every year, we bring Muslims together for spiritual development, intellectual enhancement as well as networking. “This year, we chose a theme that reflects the issue of the family as it affects us as an organisation and individuals. “The family is an important sub-structure in the society and if it is weak, the super structure (economy, politics, government and others) will not function effectively. “Today, people talk about problems in the country but as Muslims, Allah made it very clear that the foundation of the society and even the super structure is the family,’’ he said. According to AbdulRaheem, if the family is well planned, the children would be responsible members of the society. (NAN)
