By Tukur Muntari Kano – Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has felicitated with the Christian faithful across the country, urging them to express love without boundaries to foster peaceful co-existence among Nigerians. This is contained in a statement by the company’s Head, Corporate Communications, Mr Ibrahim Sani-Shawai and made available to newsmen in Kano on Tuesday. “Christmas means a lot for many religious groups across the globe and in all, love, tolerance, peace and unity are needed, if we must move forward as a nation. “We must leverage on the love that comes with this season to unite against the evil that fights our collective peace and unity in our various societies to make Nigeria safer. “One of the challenges we have to grapple with as a nation is the issue of hate for one another or showing boundary, love, where people that belong to your tribe or religion deserve your love while others do not. “We must love beyond the boundaries of our differences to make our societies peaceful. With this kind of love, forgiveness will not be difficult and so with tolerance. “We need this rebirth as citizens to make the world know that Nigerians can be an example of a nation that is linguistically and ethnically diverse,” yet peaceful. The statement quoted Dr Jamilu Gwamna, the Managing Director of the Company, as also appealing to youths to use the season to have an attitudinal rebirth that would impact positively on our identity as a nation that fears God and poised toward greatness. “The youths are the leaders of tomorrow and they must rid themselves of any act that dehumanises our collective identity,” Gwamna said.
