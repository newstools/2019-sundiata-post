An armed group that kidnapped humanitarian workers in North-Eastern Nigeria in July 2019 has claimed it killed four hostages. An international aid agency, Action Against Hunger said this on Friday. “Action Against Hunger condemns these latest killings in the strongest terms and deeply regrets that its calls for the release of the hostages have not been acted upon,” it said. The group was abducted near the town of Damasak in the northeastern region where Islamist insurgents operate.  (Reuters)
