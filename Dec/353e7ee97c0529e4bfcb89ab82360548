By Aderemi Bamgbose Igbokoda (Ondo State) – The Nigerian Navy Forward Operating Base (FOB), Igbokoda, has arrested six oil thieves operating in two boats laden with several drums of adulterated diesel on Ondo coastline. Commodore Danjuma Ndanusa, the Commanding Officer, FOB, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Igbokoda, Ilaji Local Government Area of the state. Ndanjsa said that the suspects and the seizures would be handed over to the appropriate security agency for prosecution. “We arrested six suspected oil bunkerers with two boats laden with several drums of unspecified quantities of adulterated diesel for defying our stern warning that our waterways are not a safe haven for criminals. “We will hand them over to the appropriate security agencies for prosecution. “We assure law abiding citizens and legal businesses of security of lives and property in the riverine areas and waterways,” he said. He warned marine criminals to desist from their nefarious activities as the waterways in the state would no longer be safe for them. The commanding officer also commended the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice-Adm. Ibok Ette-Ekwe Ibas, for approving the delivery of five additional gunboats to the base. He said that the delivery of the gunboats was timely and would boost the capability of the personnel in fighting maritime crimes in the state in line with the navy’s strategic guidelines.
