Suspected bandits have kidnapped three people from the staff quarters of Government Science Secondary School, Dutsin-ma, Katsina State. The bandits reportedly invaded the school’s staff quarters, on Tuesday evening to perpetrate the act. It was gathered that when the bandits stormed one of the staff quarters, they abducted the wife of one of the members of staff, her sister and her daughter. The spokesman for Katsina Police Command, SP Isah Gambo, confirmed the development. He said, “The incident is true. We have, however, got a lead that will assist us in tracking down the hoodlums. “The bandits struck in the evening of December 17 (Tuesday), and our men immediately mounted roadblocks around the town. “The bandits must have come from the stretch of the Rugu forest around the town. “Those abducted include a member of staff’s wife, her sister and her daughter. But we are working towards rescuing them.” Source
