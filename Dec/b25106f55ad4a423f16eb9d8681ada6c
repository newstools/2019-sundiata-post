Today on your favourite celebrity dishing out some of their personal but controversial opinions, former Big Brother Naija reality TV star, Khloe says she can’t marry a man that doesn’t have at least three cars, two houses and the list goes on and on.
The reality TV star made this known via her Instagram page on Thursday, December 12, 2019. In a very lengthy post, Khloe said it’s her personal decision as she doesn’t plan to bring into the world kids who won’t enjoy all the good things of life. “So last night at dinner I was having a conversation with the girls and I said I can’t MARRY a broke man that doesn’t have at least 3 cars, 2 houses, and 2 stable businesses …. so it got online and people are insulting me … 1. That’s my wish, not yours. 2. I repeat I’m not bringing a child into this world if my husband and me are not financially stable. 3. It’s me that knows what I went through growing up and I don’t wish that for my children. 4. I have half of these things, so why should I go lower. 5. It’s none of your goddam business what I wish for,” she wrote.
