The Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has sentenced a former Abia State Governor, and current Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, to a maximum sentence of 12 years imprisonment for N7.65bn fraud, among other multiple sentences ranging from 3 years to 5 years on 27 counts. The judge also ordered that Slok Nigeria Limited (Orji Uzor Kaluâ€™s company) be wound up and its assets forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria. The development is already generating a lot of reactions on social media. Take a look. Attention please( taps ðŸŽ¤): ORJI UZOR KALU IS A THIEF. This is no hate speech,please. A court of competent jurisdiction says so. Shout it very loud before appeal upturns it. Please, donâ€™t get too excited about the Orji Uzor Kalu conviction. Until the Supreme Court convicts him, I wonâ€™t get carried away. We have been through this road before. Seat is automatically vacated. It is turn by turn for the criminals, their turn is coming ahead Orji Uzor Kalu. Joshua Dariye. Jolly Nyame.I wonder who is next to join the growing band, "Their Excellencies, The Convicts". You can decamp to APC all you want but the long arm of the law will still catch up with you. Goodbye Orji Uzor Kalu. Actions have consequences I hope Babachir David Lawal also get convicted one day.Orji Uzor Kalu gets 12 years imprisonment https://t.co/Z5TbgcG5SG
