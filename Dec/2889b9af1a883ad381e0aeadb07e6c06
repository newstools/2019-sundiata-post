By Muftau Ogunyemi Akure – Dr Olusegun Mimiko, the immediate past Governor of Ondo State, has enjoined Christians to remember the needy in the society during the Christmas celebration. Mimiko said this was the only way to accord proper meaning to the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. This is contained in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, John Paul Akinduro, on Tuesday in Akure. “As we celebrate the birth of Christ with families and friends, let us remember the needy. “We must uphold the very values Jesus taught and embodied by sharing with others and caring for those on society’s margins, the sick, the poor and the hungry,” he said. Mimiko, who said that the celebration of Christmas should be seen by all as an opportunity to share and exhibit love for one another, admonished Nigerians of all backgrounds to continue to live in harmony with one another. “We have lived together in unity and solidarity throughout history, we must find strength in our diversity and continue to accommodate one and another regardless of our political, religious and ethnic affiliations,” he said. While wishing Christians in Ondo State and the country at large a merry Christmas, Mimiko urged them not to forget the lesson of love as one of the ideals of the season. (NAN)
