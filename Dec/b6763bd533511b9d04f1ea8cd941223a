The 72-hour ultimatum followed US Congress approval in a resolution of an Act, authorising President Donald Trump and US Department of Defence to force Biya to comply. The announcement was made yesterday in a YouTube video, monitored in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital. According to the video, the US Congress Act, said, “President Paul Biya has 72 hours to pull the military from the Union Treaty Territory of Cameroon.” Other facilities to be evacuated by Cameroonian military include four airports in the occupied territory, to be monitored by U.S military intelligence in Chad, Nigeria, Central African Republic and Gabon. It warned, “Failure to comply will face the wrath of U.S. military authorities,” urging Biya to release all detained citizens of LA du Republic Cameroon. It has also been reported that 24 councils of Borno, Adamawa and Taraba States in Nigeria are carved out for the new state. According to UN workshops coordinator and chairman, Steering Committee, Prof. Martin Chia Ateh, Cameroonian military pullout was to actualise the State of Cameroon by the United Nations (UN) on July 10, next year. (Leadership)
