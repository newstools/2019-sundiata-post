Damascus – At least three people were killed on Monday in an overnight Israeli missile strike on positions of the Syrian capital Damascus, a war monitor reported. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the Israeli missile strike targeted areas between the Sayyidah Zaynab area and the Aqraba area near the international airport of Damascus. The watchdog group said the targeted positions probably belong to Iranian-backed militia groups. It also noted that the three people killed were non-Syrian nationals. However, the state-run SANA News Agency said the Syrian air defences intercepted some Israeli missiles. “People in the capital heard the sound of powerful explosions as a result of the firing of air defenses that were triggered by the missile attack. “The air defenses intercepted hostile targets fired from inside the occupied territories. One of the missiles fell in the town of Akraba in Damascus countryside,“ SANA said. Meanehile, so far, Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria against Iranian targets and convoys of transporting weapons to Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Lebanese militia. However, in 2019 alone, more than 17 Israeli attacks took place against targets in Syria, the latest of which occurred on Nov. 20, when several Israeli missiles targeted sites in the oSuthern and South-Eastern outskirts of Damascus.
