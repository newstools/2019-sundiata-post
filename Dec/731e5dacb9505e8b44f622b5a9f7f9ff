By Blessing Odega Jos – Most federal and state civil servants in Jos have yet to resume work after the Christmas celebration. A correspondent of News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) who visited the State and Federal Secretariats in Jos on Friday reports that the work places which usually witness heavy human and vehicular traffic recorded low activity. This was because most workers had yet to resume work after the public holiday. At the state secretariat, the various offices where opened with very few staff available but security guards and cleaners were seen carrying out their duties. A civil servant at the state secretariat, who pleaded anonymity, told NAN that most workers have yet to resume as they had travelled out of the state for Christmas. The scenario was similar at the Federal Secretariat as  most ministries were opened with very few staff reporting for duty. Business activities had, however, resumed at the city’s business hub on Ahmadu Bello way as people were seen transacting businesses, while banks had long queues of customers. (NAN)
