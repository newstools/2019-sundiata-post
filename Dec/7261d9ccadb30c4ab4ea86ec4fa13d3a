By Deborah Akpede Ikeja – A 25 -year-old driver, Oguntayo Ojo, was on Friday docked at an Ikeja Magistrates’ court, Lagos for alleged stealing of a motorcycle valued at N 218,000. Ojo, who resides at Ipaja, Lagos, was arraigned on a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing, which he denied committing. The Magistrate, Mrs B.O Osunsanmi, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N50,000 with one surety who should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The prosecutor, Insp. Ezekiel Ayorinde, told the court that the defendant and one other person still at large committed the offences on Nov. 14 at Ipaja, Lagos. Ayorinde said that the defendant stole the motorcycle belonging to Mr Rafiu Waheed. He said that Ojo obtained the motorcycle from the complainant, with a promise to remit money to him weekly. “After few days, the defendant claimed that the motorcycle had been stolen where he parked it. “The complainant reported the case, leading to the arrest of the defendant,” the prosecutor said. The offences violate sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that section 287 stipulates three years imprisonment for stealing, while section 411 prescribes two years for conspiracy.
