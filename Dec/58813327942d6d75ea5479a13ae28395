Chairman of Warri South Local Government Area, Dr. Michael Tidi, has felicitated with the people of Warri South Local Government and other well-meaning Nigerians on the celebration of Christmas today, Wednesday, December 25, 2019. He said in his Christmas message that “the birth of Jesus Christ should remind everyone of the need to re-dedicate our lives to God, show love to one another and express goodwill at all times.” Dr. Tidi noted that “God expects everyone to emulate His teachings of divine love, irrespective of ethno-religious differences.” He added that the practice of God’s love would lead to greater peace, unity of purpose and even development across the country. The Warri South Local Government Chief Executive pointed out that the journey into the incoming decade would be positively fruitful if Nigerians genuinely practise divine love and embrace ethno-religious tolerance.
