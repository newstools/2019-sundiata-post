The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has launched 14-day special emergency operation on roads in South-East, which is code named “Operation Eagle Eye”. The South-East Zonal Coordinator of NEMA, Mr Fred Anusim, officially flagged-off of the operation at Ninth Mile Corner near Enugu on Tuesday. Anusim said that “Operation Eagle Eye” was all about the safety of all road users this yuletide; adding that NEMA would not leave any stone unturned to ensure that all stakeholders play to the rule of obeying traffic regulations. “We have stationed three operational vehicles strategically in major road corridors and the vehicles will also conduct periodic patrols. “NEMA has already deployed 25 field staff for the operation in major road corridor in South-East and put its well-equipped intensive care ambulance on alert for any rescue. “The operation will last from Dec. 24 to Jan. 6,” he said. The NEMA coordinator explained that the operation was also meant for NEMA to quickly respond to anybody or group in any emergency situation on major roads across the zone. He noted that due to high volume of traffic during the yuletide, it had become necessary that NEMA staff stayed on major roads daily to attend to incidents of emergency and other issues affecting Nigerians travelling this period. According to him, NEMA is also assisting other first line response agencies involved in road and emergency duties this yuletide. Anusim said that NEMA would also beam its searchlight on tanker drivers, who in recent time drive recklessly and make the roads unsafe for smaller vehicles. “We will ensure that they are disciplined and give due respect to other road users this Yuletide,” he said. Representatives of various emergency and road management agencies both at Federal and state levels attended the flag-off. (News Express)
