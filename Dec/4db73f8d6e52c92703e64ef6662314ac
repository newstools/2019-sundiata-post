By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ The Presidency On Wednesday reacted to a newspaper Publication to the effect that it will henceforth address President Muhammadu Buhari by his military rank of Major General, saying that the decision in itself is another testimony to free speech and freedom of the press which present administration has pledged to uphold and preserve. Sundiata Post recalls that Punch had on its editorial today said it will henceforth address President Muhammadu Buhari with his military rank of Major General. Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity), Femi Adesina gave the reaction in a statement made available to Sundiata Post said in full: A newspaper says it will henceforth address President
Muhammadu Buhari by his military rank of Major General. Nothing untoward in it. It is a rank the President attained
by dint of hard work before he retired from the Nigerian Army. And today,
constitutionally, he is also Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. All over the world, just as in our country, a large number
of retired military officers are now democrats. It does not make those who did
not pass through military service better than them. Rather than being pejorative, addressing President Buhari by
his military rank is another testimony to free speech and freedom of the press,
which this administration (or regime, if anyone prefers: it is a matter of
semantics) has pledged to uphold and preserve. Femi Adesina Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity)
