By Anita Eboigbe Abuja, – Nigerian board game reviewer Precious Wonah has played a record-breaking 100 board games in less than a year. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that this makes Wonah the first known Nigerian to have achieved the feat in the board game industry. Wonah, known professionally as Boardgame Presh, is a game tutor at Nigeria’s first board games-only café, NIBCARD Games café and started the journey in April. She told NAN that she started out of her love for all things board games shortly after the café was opened. Wonah said she discovered her uncanny talent for learning games fast and being able to teach others to play with simple terms. According to her, it is a hobby and the best part is that her love for board games has drawn others to the industry. NAN reports that the simplicity of her reviews, shared online, has got more people curious about the benefits of board games. Describing the feeling of hitting 100 board games, she said, “It feels amazing, exciting and fulfilling! At first, there was no goal as to how many board games I can play. “I just wanted to learn, play and teach board games. But sometime in May, I realised I had played over 60 board games! And it felt fulfilling. “So I made a plan to play at least, 100 before the African Board Games Convention 2019, and here we are! “It is not just that I can play these games but that I’ve been able to interest and introduce people to modern board games. “This means increased awareness in Nigeria. I hope to do more, come 2020,” she said. She said she had played 100 board games, including ‘Splendor’, ‘Azul’, ‘Machi Koro’, ‘Homia’, ‘Safe Journi’, ‘Luku Luku’. The board game reviewer also said that she played and reviewed ‘Sherriff of Nottingham’, ‘Wan Wan Touch’, ‘Code names’ and ‘Stone Age.’
