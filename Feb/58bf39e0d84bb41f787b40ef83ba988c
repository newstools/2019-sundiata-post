By Olayinka Owolewa Ilorin – Gov. Abdulfatah Ahmed of Kwara has disowned campaign posters circulating in parts of the state promoting him as the Kwara South Senatorial Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governor spoke via a
statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Communications,
Dr Muyideen Akorede. Ahmed described the posters as fake since they were not approved,
sanctioned nor sponsored by him as he was no longer the PDP Kwara South
Senatorial candidate. He said that he stood by his earlier decision to concede the PDP
Kwara South Senatorial ticket to the incumbent, Senator Rafiu Ibrahim,
in the interest of equity and fairness. Ahmed added that he subsequently formally withdrew from the
Senatorial race in full compliance with the provisions and processes
specified by the Electoral Act. Ahmed said that on the basis of that decision, he had since
campaigned for Senator Ibrahim and could, therefore, not have authorised
the fake campaign posters. He accused the opposition party, All Progressives Congress’
candidate, of masterminding the circulation of the fake posters in a
attempt to cause confusion. He reiterated that the PDP was poised for victory at all levels in the forthcoming general elections.
