By Ismaila Chafe Abuja – President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over of loss of lives during a stampede at the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign rally in Jalingo, Taraba, on Thursday. “I
always feel very sad and distressed when ordinary Nigerians who love me
and our party because of what we stand for and have done, make personal
sacrifices by taking the pains to show their support, end their lives
tragically,” the president said in a statement in Abuja. Malam
Garba Shehu, the president’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and
Publicity, in a statement, said the president made his feelings known
when he reacted to reports of the tragic death of some APC supporters
due to the overwhelming crowd at the Jolly Nyame Stadium. President
Buhari, who expressed appreciation over massive support he had been
receiving all over the country, however, called for restraint on the
part of his supporters to avoid such tragic incidences, and improved
crowd management at rally grounds. “I
want them to stay alive and witness the dividends of purposeful
governance that the APC administration will unfold when they renew our
mandate,’’ he said. While
commiserating with the families of the victims and the APC family, the
president prayed Almighty God to grant peace to the souls of the
departed, and speedy recovery to the injured.(NAN)
