By Mohammed Lawal Zaria – The National Cotton Association of Nigeria (NCAN), Kaduna State chapter, on Saturday pledged to produce 15,000 tonnes of cotton in the 2019 farming season. Its Acting Chairman, Alhaji Auwalu Wappah, said this in an interview
with journalists at the ongoing 2019 Cotton Farmers Capturing Exercise
in Zaria. He said producing such number of tonnes was possible in view of
recent encouraging move and support from government, adding that members
of the association are prepared for the task. The chairman said the programme is powered by the Anchor-Borrower
Programme in collaboration with Nigeria Incentive Based Risk Sharing
System for Agricultural lending (NIRSAL). “We have about 15,000 registered members but it is expected to have
nothing less than 10,000 farmers to actively take part in the programme. “The NIRSAL/CBN are to supply all the necessary inputs for the farmers as well the funds to execute the farming accordingly. “Of the 23 Local Government Areas of Kaduna State, 17 engaged in
cotton farming, while 15 are now taking part in the programme except
Kachia and Zango Kataf who are yet to register their members,” he said. He advised cotton farmers across the state to make use of the golden
opportunity to benefit from the programme before it runs out. While assuring members that their welfare was one of the topmost
priorities of the union, Wappah enjoined them to be peaceful and low
abiding to benefit more from government policies and programmes.
