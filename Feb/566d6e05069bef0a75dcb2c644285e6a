Brussels – An EU top diplomat has called on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to allow convoys of trucks carrying food and medical supplies into the country. “The refusal of the regime to
recognise the humanitarian emergency is leading to an escalation of
tension,’’ Federica Mogherini said in a statement on Sunday. Deadly clashes erupted on Saturday
on the Venezuelan border as Maduro’s forces blocked entry of aid
arriving from Colombia and Brazil. Report says Maduro regards the aid as a pretext for a U.S. military intervention. “We strongly call on law enforcement
and security bodies to show restraint, avoid use of force and allow for
the entry of aid,’’ Mogherini said on behalf of the EU’s 28 member
states. Many European capitals recognise Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim President. The EU is however urging Maduro to hold free and fair election as soon as possible. Maduro has presided over a massive
economic crisis, with annual inflation running to millions while over 3
million Venezuelans have fled abroad. He was declared the winner of an election boycotted by most of the opposition in 2018.
