By Yakubu Uba Yola – The Public Complaints Commission (PCC) office in Adamawa said on Wednesday that it resolved 114 of the 453 complaints before it in 2018. The State Commissioner of the PCC, Mr Manassah Michael who disclosed this in a statement in Yola, said the remaining pending cases including those forwarded from 2017 would be investigated to conclusion. Manassah said the commission had last year created both public and private sector investigation divisions to facilitate it work. “The public sector division handles and investigates complaints lodged against government establishments and its officials, while the private sector division handles and investigates complaints lodged against private organisations and its officials. “The creation of these divisions became necessary to bring about more efficiency in the delivery of the commission’s services as mandated in the PCC Act,” Michael said. He explained that some of the complaints received in 2018 included: under-payment of salaries, wrongful termination of appointment, unlawful confiscation of land, non-payment of retirement benefits and non-payment of gratuity. Others are dispense error by ATMs, illegal deductions of money from account, prolonged electric power outstage, non-payment of contributory pension and non-payment of welfare benefits. The commissioner identified lack of cooperation and delays in responding to its letters of inquiry by organisations as the major challenges affecting its speedy dispensation of complaints. “Inadequate funds too constituted a constraint to achieving the set target for the year. “I wish to take this opportunity to appeal to those whose rights have been trampled upon or denied not to take the law into their hands but approach the commission for redress, as its services are rendered free of charge,” Michael said. He said the commission had five offices across the state sited in Yola, Mubi, Gombi, Numan and Ganye town for the public to reach out with their complaints.
