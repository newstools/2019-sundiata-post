By Aderogba George Abuja, – The Citizens Advocacy for Social and Economic Rights (CASER) has urged Nigerians who suffered losses or hardships because of the elections postponement to sue the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Mr Frank Tietie, the Executive Director of CASER, a Civil Society
Organisation (CSO) made the call on Sunday in an interview with the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN). NAN recalls that INEC had on Feb. 16, a few hours to the Presidential
and National Assembly Election, announced new dates for the general
elections in Nigeria. According to Tietie, whether INEC postponed the elections in national
interest or not, it is immaterial to Nigerians who suffered losses and
untold hardships as a result of the poll shift. He said such legal actions would to teach INEC and other institutions
or agencies of government a lesson to be serious and not take citizens
for granted. “Furthermore, that INEC and the government have failed to give
sufficient explanation with apology that is generally satisfactory is
unacceptable. “Therefore, this action of INEC must be visited with an unprecedented
exemplary damages awarded by the courts against the commission and
possibly the government, on account of the unnecessary hardships
Nigerians had to go through before they could cast their votes. “CASER urges Nigerians not to accept such dereliction of official state duty,” he stressed. Tietie said that CASER, through its Strategic Public Interest
Litigation Secretariat, would connect with potential litigants with
competent spirited lawyers for the purpose of ensuring justice for
citizens who suffered from the postponement.
