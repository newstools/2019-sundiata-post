When parts of the country are drenched in oceans of blood, Buhari is clueless. When Boko Haram murders civilians and soldiers alike, he is toothless But when his continuity in Aso Rock is threatened, he is suddenly ruthless Nevertheless, if he had signed the Electoral Act, which provides for
on-the-spot electronic transmission of election results, there would be
no need for ballot boxes and no threat of snatching them. But Buhari is a violent, murderous old thug and a monster of depravity who is irredeemably stuck in the dim past. No nation deserves that sort of disaster of a man as president. Source: Facebook
