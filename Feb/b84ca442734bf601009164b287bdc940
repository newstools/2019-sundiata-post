JOHANNESBURG â€“ A bailout for struggling South African state utility Eskom could reach as much as 150 billion rand ($10.79 billion) over 10 years, a senior National Treasury official told Reuters. The Treasury said on Wednesday that it would provide Eskom with 69 billion rand of financial support over three years. But Ian Stuart, a senior official at the budget office, told Reuters that Treasury had included in its national debt-to-GDP projections a further 23 billion rand of annual support to Eskom after that three-year period. The final amount of support would depend on factors including economic growth, demand for electricity and the rate of reorganisation at Eskom, Stuart said. ($1 = 13.8955 rand) (Reuters)
