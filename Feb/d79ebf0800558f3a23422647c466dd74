By Adaeze Iroha Lagos – A 28-year-old unemployed man, Taiwo Ogunmodede, who allegedly broke into a real estate firm and stole N1.6 million from, on Monday appeared in a Yaba Chief  Magistrates’ court in Lagos. Ogunmodede, whose address was not provided, is charged with two counts of burglary and stealing. The prosecutor, Sgt. Modupe Olaluwoye, told the court that the
defendant on Oct. 24, 2018 at 2 a.m. broke into a real estate firm at
Mile II Estate in Lagos, belonging to Mr Babatunde Shittu. Olaluwoye alleged that the defendant stole an Infinix Note 5 phone
valued at N102, 000 and N1.6 million cash that was locked in the
complainant’s office desk. “My Lord, a neighbour saw the defendant running away from the office
at 2 a.m. and called the attention of the security guard to it. “When the guard went to check the office, he noticed that it had been
broken into and he reported the matter at the police station,” she
said. The offence, she said, contravened the provisions of sections 287 and 307 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 307 stipulates seven-year jail term for the offence of burglary. In her ruling, Magistrate Oluwatoyin Oghere, admitted the defendant
to bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two responsible sureties in like
sum. Oghere ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed and show
evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned until May 15 for mention.
