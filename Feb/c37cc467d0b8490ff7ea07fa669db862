By Harrison Arubu Abuja – Nigerian media practitioners rose from a two-day meeting in Abuja on Saturday with the declaration of Feb. 14 as the National Media Peace Day. The theme of the maiden event, coming two days to the 2019 general
elections, is: “Nigeria Media Peace Day: Think Election, Think Peace”. Practitioners from the print, broadcast and the new media signed the
declaration, read by the President of the Nigeria Union of Journalists
(NUJ), Mr Christopher Isiguzo, and geared toward promoting violence-free
2019 elections. The News Agency of the Nigeria (NAN) reports that the meeting was
organised by Search for Common Ground (SFCG), an international
non-governmental organisation committed to ending violent conflicts
globally. Expressing apprehension about the proliferation of of small arms,
thuggery, hate speech and fake news ahead of the elections, the
participants called on media practitioners and political actors to
exercise caution. The meeting also drew attention to the fate of persons with
disabilities and other vulnerable groups participating in the
electioneering process. They urged relevant authorities, including election management
bodies, to provide all the facilities needed for them to exercise their
franchise. The participants further enjoined all stakeholders and actors in the
process to put Nigeria first in all their actions in the build-up to the
2019 general elections and beyond. They pledged to disseminate news items, feature stories, analysis and
talk shows that would promote peace as a prerequisite to development.
