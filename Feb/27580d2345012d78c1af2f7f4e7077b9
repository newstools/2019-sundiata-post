By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu – The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to further extend by two days the deadline for collection of Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs). NANS National Public Relations Officer, Mr Bestman Okereafor, who
made the appeal in Enugu on Sunday, said that the association wanted an
extension of the deadline for collection to Wednesday, Feb. 13, 2019. “This appeal is basically to enable students who registered in campus
environments but could not collect their PVCs for three months, due to
the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strike,’’ he said in a
statement. Okereafor said that it would be unfair to disenfranchise millions of
students who did their Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) in polling
centres located in their schools or host communities of their schools. “The attention of the apex students governing body, NANS, has been
drawn to a statement credited to INEC as regards the deadline for the
collection of PVCs scheduled to end on Friday, Feb. 8 but extended
nationwide to Monday, Feb. 11. This will include Saturday and Sunday. “NANS considers this decision for PVC collection extension as a very
good one but passionately appeal to INEC to consider further extension
of PVC collection to Wednesday, Feb. 13. “This is to enable Nigerian students who registered in campus
environments but could not collect it three months ago due to the ASUU
strike to do so,’’ he said. According to him, further extension to Feb.13, will enable students
as major stakeholders to pick up the PVCs to exercise our franchise.
