By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Former Minister of Aviation and
chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party, Femi Fani-Kayode has reacted to the
postponement of the presidential election by the Independent National Electoral
Commission, (INEC). Apparently referring to President Muhammadu Buhari,
the former minister who took to his twitter handle @realFFK said “Postpone the
election as many times as you like, you are on your way out! And after
you have been unseated you will be bundled to the International Criminal Court
at the Hague to answer for mass murder, ethnic cleansing, genocide and crimes
against humanity. Glory halellujah! Recall that the presidential election was scheduled to hold (today)
Saturday, 16th February, but surprisingly, the Independent National
Electoral Commission (INEC) announced the postponement around 3am this morning
on account of logistics. Sundiata Post recalls that prior to the postponement, there
were reports from some journalists and the some stakeholders that there the
election materials have not arrived some states and that there were instances
where electoral materials meant for a particular state were taken to different
state. However, the postponement election by the INEC has attracted
wide condemnation demanding for explanations as to the reason why the election
was postponed given that the commission has repeatedly reiterated its
preparedness to conduct election.
