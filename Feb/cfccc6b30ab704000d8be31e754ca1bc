Moscow – Russia and Turkey’s defence ministers on Monday agreed on the need to take what they called decisive measures to stabilise the situation in Syria’s Idlib province during talks, Russia’s RIA news agency cited a joint statement as saying. Russia, an important Syrian government ally, and Turkey brokered a
deal in September to create a demilitarised zone in the Northwest Idlib
region that would be evacuated of all heavy weapons and jihadist
fighters. However, the area has been the site of continued hostilities with
Russia saying that militants who used to belong to the Nusra Front group
are in control of large swaths of territory. “A joint statement published after the talks between the two defence
ministers in Ankara spoke of `the need in particular to take decisive
measures to ensure security in the Idlib demilitarised zone’,” RIA
reported. (Reuters/NAN)
