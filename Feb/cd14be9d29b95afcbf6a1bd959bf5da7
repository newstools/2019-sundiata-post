Mr Hamma Kwajaffa, Director-General, Nigeria Textile
Manufacturers Association, commended the  manufacturing sector’s
contribution to VAT, saying there was a correlation between economic
growth and VAT revenue.
He said that increased contribution of manufacturing
sector to VAT, especially in the fourth quarter of 2018, was driven by
consumer spending during Christmas season.
Kwajaffa urged the Federal Government to improve
infrastructure support, fiscal incentives, financing, anti-smuggling
activities and implementation of the executive order on patronage of
locally produced goods.
He said that doing these would boost the sector’s performance and invariably its contribution to VAT and Gross Domestic Product.
Similarly, Mr Muda Yusuf, Director-General of the Lagos
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), urged the government to create a
better environment that would reduce cost of production and make
manufacturers more competitive.
Yusuf said that government should expedite action to
address infrastructure problem, especially power which, he said, was a
huge challenge to the sector.
“Review some of the high tariffs on their inputs to
increase their profitability and revenue contribution to government as
well as company income tax to boost reinvestment and compliance to tax
payment.
“If the environment is conducive for them through
concessions, they will create more jobs. Aside the revenue benefits,
there is also the social benefits for the society.
“Government can look at the regulatory environment which
most manufacturers complain is too harsh; many of the regulators are
like revenue-generating agencies on their own,” he said.
He urged the government to review the cost of fund for manufacturers and evolve better mechanism for long-term financing.
Also, Mr Taiwo Oyedele, Tax Leader,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, West Africa, said that the Federal Government
would require more reliable data on who the VAT payers were.
“According to reports, only three per cent of the
taxpayers in the VAT net contributes 97 per cent of the revenue, which
means a lot of companies that ought to be paying VAT are not in the tax
net, while some are there, but are not remitting,” he said.
Oyedele said that VAT improvement in 2018, compared to
other years, was reflective of the increased efforts of the Federal
Inland Revenue Service to increase tax compliance among taxpayers.
