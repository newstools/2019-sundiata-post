The group urged INEC to “Ensure that it raises public confidence and trust in its operations. “It has to work within the newly stipulated timelines, to deliver credible, free and fair elections. “The group urged INEC to take advantage of the postponement to review
its logistics deployment management. It also urged  that all logistics
