By Philip Dzeremo Adikpo – A lawmaker in Benue, Mr Joseph Boko, representing Kwande West state constituency, who completed his defection from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at a grand rally in Adikpo, on Thursday said he would work for the party’s victory at the polls. Boko, was sworn in as a member of the 8th Benue Assembly on Feb.12,
after a protracted legal battle that traversed courts of different
judicial jurisdictions. He had been unlawfully substituted by the party and had been a
frequent litigant in courts for three and a half years in search of 
justice. The lawmaker renounced his membership of the APC  after his inauguration as an assembly member. At the rally on Thursday,  Boko said he left the party because of the
shoddy manner he was treated and the deceit of its leaders. He commended Gov Samuel Ortom for supporting him to reclaim his
stolen mandate in the state legislature and pledged to work for the
victory of the party at the polls. Former governor of the state and a senatorial candidate, Mr Gabriel
Suswam, commended Boko for his doggedness in fighting to reclaim his
mandate. He urged the people to support all PDP candidates in  the polls. Governor  Ortom commended Boko for defecting from the APC to the PDP. He said all that he lost would be restored and urged him to work with PDP leaders in the state to retain power at the polls. Ortom urged the people to support the PDP Presidential candidate,
Abubakar Atiku, to win the presidency saying ” Atiku will make life
better for all of you”. Ortom, who owes many months of salaries to civil servants, said under
Atiku’s presidency, he would have enough funds to clear all salary
arrears and make life better for the people.
