launched the framework on access and participation of the PWDs. “The document, apart from the inclusion of the PWDs in all aspects of
the electoral process, also aimed at reducing the barriers they face as
voters, aspirants, candidates, party officials as well as staff within
the commission. “The framework is basically to meet the aspirations of citizens in line with international best practice “So, this forum, therefore, aims at increasing your knowledge about
the electoral process and provisions made by the commission for PWDs to
participate during elections,” he told the PWDs at the meeting. The REC explained that the commission had simplified voting process on election days for PWDs. “ We have introduced sign languages and written instructions at

persons living with albinism, pregnant women and even the elderly, are
given priority on election days,” he said Pai said that ad hoc staff had been trained and instructed to give special attention to the PWDs on election days.
