By Auwalu Yusuf Birnin Kudu Daura – Gov. Aminu Masari of Katsina State on Friday commended the management of Daura Community College of Arabic and Islamic Studies over judicious utilisation of the N66 million donation to the school. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the college offers
diploma programmes and is affiliated to Ahmadu Bello University. Masari who paid an unscheduled visit to the school, said he was marveled at the quantum of structures built from the donation. “What the management committee is doing with the donations collected
through appeal fund to develop the school is excellent; I have no doubt
that the money collected had been judiciously used. “The quality of additional classrooms, lecture halls, library
complex, laboratories and administrative block so far executed is worthy
of emulation by government agencies and schools of equal status,” the
governor said. The Deputy Provost of the college, Malam Lawal Mai’adua, said the
college used the N66 million donation to construct 14 classrooms,
administrative block, two spacious lecture halls, library, and
laboratories for Biology, Physics and Chemistry, without compromising
quality. He also said in spite of the quantum of projects executed with the N66 million donation, “we are yet to exhaust the amount.” The deputy provost said what remained to complete the projects were
the installation of electrical fittings, provision of furniture and
renovation of students hostels. Alhaji Ado Magajiyar-Karkarku, the project supervisor, appreciated
all those who donated for the projects and urged them to visit the
college to see what has been done with their donations. He however solicited for more donations to enable the college
construct a 1,500 capacity lecture hall and additional administrative
block.
