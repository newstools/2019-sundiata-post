By Uwumarogie Peter Gombe – Mr Alhassan Yahaya, Zone E Vice-President, Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), has advised journalists to rely on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for results of the forthcoming general elections. Yahaya, who gave the advice during an interview with the News Agency
of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Gombe, also urged newsmen to be
conversant with the extant electoral laws in the discharge of their
duties. According to him, announcing results that have not been declared by
INEC is a crime and a dis-service to journalism, a profession, he notes
prides on accuracy and objectivity. “I call on journalists to rely on information from INEC during the
forthcoming general elections. Do not rely on social media report or
anybody or organisation other than INEC. “The commission is the only body mandated to announce any election
result and that must be respected, as any violation is against the
ethics of journalism. “We must not use what we have heard during voting to influence our
reports, but wait patiently on INEC to give the figures to be
announced,’’ he said. “As journalists, our job is to educate, enlighten and sensitise
Nigerians with the accurate and factual news report; in doing that, we
must be objective and not partisan.’’ Yahaya also called on journalists to be aware of the dangers of fake
news as well as the credibility of news report, appealing that they
should not be used as purveyors of fake news. He also urged security agencies to always collaborate with
journalists and other stakeholders for the success of the planned
general elections.
