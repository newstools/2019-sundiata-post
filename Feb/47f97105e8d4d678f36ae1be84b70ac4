No fewer than 10,000 members of the National Association of Nigerian Prostitutes, NANP, on Tuesday stormed Abuja, the nation’s capital ahead of the February 16 presidential and National Assembly elections. The group vowed to mobilize its members across the country for the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Confirming the development to DAILY POST Tuesday evening, Secretary General of the group, Sandra Efosa, said they settled for Atiku after studying his policy documents carefully for several weeks. Efosa said under the current government, their ”bed-to-wealth” has suffered low patronage due to harsh economy. “Hi Bro, just entered Abuja with my President, Madam Tamar Tion and 10,000 other members ahead of the presidential election to declare our support for Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. “We shall be mobilizing our members across the country to work for the election of the PDP candidate. I shall let you know of our next step,” Efosa said in a message sent to our reporter on Whatsapp. When prodded further if the association would be declaring ”free sex” like they did in 2015, Efosa said, “of course, that is our tradition but I will issue a comprehensive statement on why we settled for Atiku having endorsed Bukola Saraki earlier,” she added.Source:
