Enugu â€“ Prince Lawrence Eze, the embattled All Progressives Congress (APC) Senatorial Candidate for Enugu East says he has appealed the judgement nullifying his candidature by a Federal High Court, Enugu. Eze told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in a telephone interview in
Enugu on Tuesday that he had directed his lawyer, Ferdinand Ukwueze to
immediately file an appeal. NAN reports that the court on Tuesday sacked the candidate on the grounds that he was not properly nominated for the contest. The court ruled that the plaintiff, Mrs Adaku Ogbu-Aguocha who came
third in the APC primary election held on Oct. 2, 2018 was the rightful
candidate. The court presided over by Justice Buba Ibrahim ruled that
Ogbu-Aguocha should take over since Uchenna Ezemba who came second in
the party primary stepped down for Eze. Ogbu-Aguocha filed a suit challenging the decision of the party to
field Eze whom, she said, never contested and was not a member of the
party as at the time of the primary. She, among other reliefs, prayed the court to declare her the duly
elected candidate of the APC since Ezemba, who emerged winner of the
primary election, withdrew from the race. The court however, directed the APC to forward the name of the
applicant to the third respondent, Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC) as the recognised candidate for the senatorial
district without further delay. NAN reports that Eze is the second APC candidate sacked by a court as
the former governorship candidate; Ayogu Eze lost the ticket to
factional candidate, Mr George Ogara following a similar reason. (NAN)
