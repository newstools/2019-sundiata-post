By Yemi Adeleye Lagos – Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) have surfaced at  the Lagos State Collation Centre for the Presidential Election, situated at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) headquarters office, Yaba. The  10 officials  entered INEC premises before 10:00pm on Saturday
night and sat under the canopy erected for the collation of Presidential
results across the 20 local government areas of the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the operatives, who
were wearing their aprons with EFCC inscriptions sat quietly awaiting
the commencement of the final collation exercise in the state. The operatives were seated and  fully at alert at the collation centre. Their mission was not clear. Speaking to NAN, a staff of the commission, who preferred anonymity,
said that in his many years of service in the commission, the operatives
of EFCC had never  participated in  elections’ result collation. Another official of the commission, who would not want his name
mentioned in print suggested that the operatives were on ground to
tackle the menace of vote selling and buying. Meanwhile, collations of the Presidential and National Assembly
elections are ongoing in many centres and no results from any local
government areas of the state has reached the final state collation
centre in INEC office. However, the venue was  scanty as at 12:00 midnight with some
journalists and many security agents going in and out of the premises. The final collation for the Presidential elections in the state may be delayed till Sunday morning. NAN reports that many Registration Area Collation Officers in the
Lagos Mainland Federal Constituency collation centre situated at St.
Agnes Primary School, Birrel in Yaba, next fence to INEC office, were
still busy with the exercise.
