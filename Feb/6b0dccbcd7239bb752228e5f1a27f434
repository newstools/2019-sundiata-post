By Olawale Jokotoye – Political parties in Ogun have called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to lift the embargo on campaigns  ahead of  Saturday’s polls. The Chairman of the Ogun chapter of the Inter Party Advisory Council
(IPAC), Mr Arabambi Abayomi, made the call in Abeokuta on Monday in an
interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). NAN reports that after the commission failed to hold the Presidential
and National Assembly elections scheduled for  Feb. 16, INEC had
declared that no political party was allowed to re-open campaigns. But the IPAC chairman insisted that the electoral law provided that campaigns could go on till 24 hours to the elections. He since the elections  were postponed by INEC, the parties should not be made to suffer for the commission’s lapses. Abayomi stressed that the political parties needed to re-double their
efforts, sensitise and re-mobilise their members and supporters to
enhance their chances of winning the elections. He argued that extending the campaign period would be to INEC’s
advantage as such review would enable the political parties to  boost
the morale of the electorate who might have been discouraged by the
postponement. According to Abayomi, there will be serious apathy and low turnout at
the polls on Saturday except the parties are allowed to reach out again
to their members and supporters. (NAN)
