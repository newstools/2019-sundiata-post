By Shehu Danjuma Katsina – Gov. Aminu Masari of Katsina State has tasked wealthy individuals to introduce mechanism that would improve the living standard of the less privileged persons in the state. Masari stated this while receiving 333 motorcycles and 10 saloon cars
donated by Col. Abdul-Aziz Musa Yar’adua (Rtd.) to support the campaign
programme of President Buhari and the governor, on Saturday in Katsina. ”The rich persons should remember that their brothers and sisters
they left behind at home need their assistance  that will lift their
condition of life. ”The Katsina Government is ever ready to collaborate with any person
to undertake any project that have direct bearing on the lives of
ordinary folks in the state,” he said. The governor said that the state government cannot do everything to
the common man alone, adding, “that is the reason rich individuals must
come in to assist the local people.” Masari said that he was happy with the donation, advising those to be allocated the vehicles not to sell them, but maintain them to improve their lives as the items would be used for only three weeks during the campaigns. Earlier, Yar’adua said apart from the vehicles, he also support
“the two campaign organisations with 15,000 T-shirts and 15,000 face
caps because I share the same ideology with President Buhari and Gov.
Masari. ”As a card carrying member of the great APC, I am ever ready to give my support and assistance so that common man will smile.” In his remark, APC leader in the state, Alhaji Dahiru Mangal, commended Yar’adua for the donation.
