By Thompson Yamput Pankshin – Rep Timothy Golu (PDP/Plateau), on Sunday said that President Muhammadu Buhari would “graciously hand over power”, if he loses the Presidential election, contrary to speculations to the contrary. Golu, who represents Pankshin, Kanke and Kanam Federal Constituency,
told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Kanke, that he had known
Buhari as a man of integrity “for a very long time”. “The President Muhammadu Buhari I know is a man of integrity and if
he loses this election, I am sure he will pack his things and go home. “I believe Buhari is a man of integrity that will not toy with the
will of the people. Many people that know him and are close to him will
tell you that if the man loses today, he will leave. “If somebody has done that to him, definitely he, too, can do it to
another person. Buhari has seen it all in life. There is nothing he
cannot do if he is convinced that Nigeria will be better for it.” On the status of Nigeria’s
democracy, he said that Nigerians were getting wiser and more eager to
be part of the democratic process. He commended INEC for conducting a credible, transparent and
successful elections “to the surprise of the international community”. Mr David Paradang, PDP candidate
for the Plateau Central senatorial seat, expressed happiness over the
smooth conduct of the polls, but advised INEC to ensure that every vote
was counted so that the peope’s wish would not be subverted. “Failing in an election puts losers in a bad mood, but once the process is transparent, the loser’s pains will be lessened. “There is always another opportunity once there is life. The society
must move forward. No politician will deliberately want to cause crises
for the fun of it,” he said.
