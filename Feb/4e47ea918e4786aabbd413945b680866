Awka – The Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) has decried the destruction of some of its electricity installation by the petrol tanker fire accident which occurred in Awka, Anambra, on Saturday. Mr Chukwuemeka Ezeh, Head, Communication Department, disclosed this to the News agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Awka on Monday. Ezeh said the inferno gutted a transformer and feeder pillars near
Anambra Governor’s Lodge and affected the Enugu-Agidi 11KV line. He expressed sadness over the sudden power cut to some parts of the
capital territory and assured that engineers of the company were already
working to restore supply. The company however, commiserated with those who lost their loved ones and property in the fire. “The fire incident was an unfortunate one. “It affected our Enugu-Agidi 11kv line, through Amawbia round about. “One of our transformers and feeder pillars got burnt and the aluminum conductor feeding the governor’s lodge burnt down. “Our men could not restore supply to our customers immediately, but
we were able to restore supply this morning, with the exception of our
customers and the governor’s lodge feeding from the burnt transformer. “Efforts are however, ongoing to ensure the remaining areas are restored. “We appeal to our customers affected by this development for patience
and understanding while we work at resolving this issue,” he said. NAN reports that the Anambra Police Command confirmed that no fewer
than seven persons died, while about 13 vehicles were burnt in the
accident.
