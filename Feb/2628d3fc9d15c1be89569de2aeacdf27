By Mohammad Tijjani Kaduna, – The Police Command in Kaduna State said on Friday that it would deploy no fewer than 12,500 of its personnel to beef up security during Saturday’s  election across the state. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Yakubu Sabo, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kaduna. Sabo also said that the police would be supported by other agencies
including Immigration, Prison, Customs and NSCDC to provide conducive
environment for a peaceful election. He said the command had carried out threat analysis, based on which
identified flash points would be effectively policed to ensure safety of
voters and other citizens. The command spokesman stressed that adequate security measures had
been put in place to tackle those who planned to disrupt the elections,
assuring all voters of adequate security. On alleged deployment of members of community vigilante service for the election, Sabo said there was no such plan. He noted that the Commissioner of Police, Ahmad Abdur-Rahman, had
made it clear that local security guards would not be involved in
security duties during the elections. “It is only the Police and other constituted security agencies that
will be involved in security during the election in the state, no
vigilante will be allowed to partake in the provision of security during
the election,” Sabo said. The PPRO appealed to the electorates to assist security agencies with useful information that would ensure peaceful elections. “This call is equally extended to the political class; no thug should
be used to disrupt the electoral process and citizens are obliged to
inform the securities with information where such occur for prompt
intervention.”
