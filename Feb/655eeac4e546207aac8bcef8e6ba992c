By Ojonugwa Felix Ugboja The increasing rate of criminal activities by bandits, herders and other elements in the Northwest of Nigeria has led to the death of no less than 120 people in January alone. According to the figures by GO7 Media, these deaths show a worrisome pattern where bandits and kidnappers storm communities, usually with little resistance. The deaths also include those (criminals) whom were tracked and killed by the Nigerian military troupe. According to author and activist, Chidi Odinkalu, “As #NigeriaDecides2019 approaches, it’s becoming increasingly impossible to distinguish structural violence from political or election-related violence. Whatever it is, with over 120 killed, the number, scope & frequency of killings in NW #Nigeria alone in Jan 2019 was staggering.” Nigeria has few days from now to decide in the polls, and security, especially with the current situation will be a major part of the decision making for many of them.
