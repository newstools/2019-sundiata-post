(Sundiata Post) – The Chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof
Yakubu Mahmud has informed that the postponement of the presidential and National
Assembly elections was to prevent staggered election. Prof Mahmud said
had the election been allowed to continue, it would no longer be a general
election but would have amounted to staggered election which will not occur
well for the country and the process. The INEC chairman,
who took responsibility on behalf of the commission for the postponed election,
rolled out some issues that led to the decision by the commission. He disclosed
this at the World Press briefing at the International Conference Centre in
Abuja which also serves as the collation Centre for the elections. According to
him, delay in delivering ballot sheets and electoral materials to some areas occasioned
by bad weather which hindered the supply of materials as well as destruction of
Permanent Voters Card (PVC), and burning its offices and cubicles accounted for
part of the reason for the postponement. Details
