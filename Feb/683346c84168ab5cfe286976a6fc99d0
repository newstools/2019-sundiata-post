By Uchenna Eletuo Lagos – The Nationally Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) said that it would henceforth picket truck drivers involved in bribing their ways to loading point at the Apapa Port. Chief Remi Ogungbemi, NARTO President gave the warning in a chat with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Saturday. Ogungbemi said with the completion
and return of trucks to the Apapa Wharf Road and the continued traffic
gridlock on the road, it was time the association looked elsewhere for
solutions. “With the completion and use of the
Apapa Wharf Road, expectation was high that gridlock would disappear,
instead the problems remain. “Fingers have continued to point at
truck drivers that bribe their way through and in most cases the
disagreement that such cheating may cause particularly for those on the
queue. “Some drivers who may want to
prevent such sharp practices use their trucks to cause obstruction that
may take a whole day to resolve,” he said. According him, if the truck drivers are made to be orderly, it would go a long way in stopping the traffic. He said henceforth, driving documents of drivers caught disrupting lanes would be seized for a period of time. He also said that those operators
who were in the habit of collecting money to aid such disorderly
practices would be reported for immediate action. He, however, regretted the near
collapse of haulage and transporting business in the ports and its
negative bearing on the nation’s economy. He also assured of NARTO’s efforts to work with other stakeholders to make the port user-friendly (NAN)
