By Aisha Gambo Kaduna – The National Orientation Agency (NOA) on Wednesday took voter education to Kawo Motor Park in Kaduna to sensitise the public against vote-buying and vote-selling. Zubair Galadima-Soba, the agency’s Coordinator in the state said that motor parks were central because they
have different categories of people coming in and going out, thereby making it veritable location for sending messages. The coordinator said “motor parks are central because they form a great proportion of the country’s population. “People transit from one place to another across the country; and it is one of the surest ways of conveying messages. “So, we believe this message will go across the 23 local government areas of Kaduna State and beyond.” Galadima-Soba urged the electorate to resist vote-selling no matter how “juicy” because the act amount to
sale of citizens’ rights. He advised politicians to avoid vote-buying, stressing that “anyone caught would face 12 months
imprisonment or N100,000 fine, or both.” Mr Hassan Ibrahim, the Secretary, National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in the state, described
the union as a major stakeholder in the election process, especially in the area of transportation of election materials
from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) office to polling units. He said “we would continue to sensitise our members against vote-buying and vote-selling, and to vote for
candidates of their choice. “We must be very careful with dubious politicians who deceive innocent voters and collect their cards, especially
the aged and the illiterates and give them meagre amount of money in return.” The secretary added that the union would not encourage vote-buying and selling and anyone caught would be dealt
with. (NAN)
