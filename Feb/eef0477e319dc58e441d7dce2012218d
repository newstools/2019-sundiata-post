By Ifeoma Aka Enugu – The Special Adviser to the President on Justice Reform, Mrs Juliet Ibekaku and APC candidate for the Enugu West Senatorial District has rejected the result of Saturday’s election for the zone. “I reject the result announced by Enugu State Independent National
Electoral Commission (INEC) in its entirety and will contest it,’’
Ibekaku told a news conference on Tuesday in Enugu. “I call on well meaning Enugu people that have evidence that will assist us to please do so.’’ She alleged that Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly
elections in Enugu State were fraught with irregularities and outright
hijacking of ballot boxes and ballot papers. Ibekaku said that apart from the non-use of smart card readers, there
was indiscriminate thumb printing of ballot papers by individual who
disguised as INEC officials, adding that there was also vote buying. She, however, assured her supporters in the zone that their votes would count. Ibekaku said she had joined the state chapter of All progressive
Congress (APC) in “rejecting the outright stealing of the people’s votes
by Sen. Ike Ekweremadu and his thugs who disguised as INEC officials.’’ Ibekaku accused Ekweremadu of snatching ballot boxes because of his desperation to return to the Senate for the fifth time. She also alleged that the Deputy Senate President deployed the
“people’s stolen wealth to brazenly compromise electoral officials,
using thugs’’. She said the PDP in Enugu and Ekweremadu “presented the sad past
where results of elections are written in the bedrooms of local
government chairman’’. She thanked the people of Enugu west senatorial zone for their support throughout her campaign and during the election.
