Warsaw – European Commission experts began an investigation into tainted Polish beef on Monday amid a food scandal sparked by the discovery of illegal practices at a plant in north-eastern Poland. Pawel Niemczuk, head of Poland’s veterinary inspectorate said the
Brussels delegation would analyse the situation on the ground for five
days in cooperation with Polish authorities. The investigation would target local veterinary authorities and
slaughterhouses, and report back in a month’s time, a commission
spokeswoman in Brussels added. An investigative report by Polish broadcaster TVN24, shown in
January, found that sick animals were being slaughtered in secret at a
plant in north-eastern Poland, and the meat being distributed and sold. The meat was “presumably unfit for human consumption,” the commission wrote in its food safety alert database. According to Polish authorities, approximately 9.5 tons of the
tainted beef has been circulated in Poland and other EU countries. The commission has said at least 15 countries are affected. The Polish police and public prosecutor’s office are also investigating the case. The plant has been closed and the meat is being traced and removed from the market. Poland’s Agriculture Minister, Jan Ardanowski has called the scandal
an isolated case and announced stricter controls at slaughterhouses,
including the introduction of 24-hour video surveillance. The EU has been shaken by several food scandals in recent years,
including the detection of an insecticide in millions of eggs in 2017
and the use of undeclared horse meat in food preparations in 2013.
