By Franca Ofili Abuja – Mr Daniel Agada, a constitutional lawyer and public affairs analyst, says ballot box snatching is an offence under the country’s  laws. Agada told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja that death was definitely not the prescribed penalty. He said that Section 33 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic
of Nigeria, 1999 (amended) provides for derogation from the right to
life. “Very worrying is the fact that such a blanket directive may be
selectively misapplied by some of our overzealous law enforcement agents
in contrivance with agents of the government. “Some trigger-happy law enforcements agents in Nigeria may even kill
innocent Nigerians and accuse them wrongly of ballot box snatching.
There exist a plethora of instances in this regard,’’ he said. President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday warned those planning to snatch
ballot boxes during the elections should avoid such act as anybody or
group caught doing that would be seriously dealt with by security
agents. He advised that the president should have directed all security
agencies to apprehend all electoral offenders and deal with them
according to the law. “You can talk tough without necessarily endangering the lives of your subjects,” he said. (NAN)
