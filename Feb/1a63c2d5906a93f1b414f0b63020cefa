By Monday Ijeh Abuja – The Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, says President Muhammadu Buhari has built prosperity foundation for Nigeria in his first four years in office. Fashola said this on Friday in Abuja at a town hall meeting organised by the “FCT to the Next Level Task Force”. He urged participants at the meeting to support the re-election bid
of Buhari adding that, his second term would witness tremendous
prosperity since the foundation was already in place. “This election is not about Buhari, it is not about APC, it is about
our children, it is about the future, it is about the fact that you
cannot change something without experiencing some discomfort “If you want a better life, you have to go through some level of discomfort. “You must not vote for those that will give you money today when in 16 years, they did not build infrastructure,” he said. Fashola urged the electorate to also vote for the APC senator and the
house of representatives candidates in the FCT to ensure that the party
was in control of the territory. He said that the anger of the opposition against Buhari was that he
stopped the importation of goods that could be produced in the country. According to him, the idea is to reduce pressure on our foreign exchange and create employment for Nigerian youths. The Minister of FCT, Malam Muhammad Bello, said the APC led Federal
Government had achieved a lot in ensuring security of lives and property
in the territory. Bello urged all Nigerians to vote for the APC to sustain the good
work it had started, adding that voting for the opposition would amount
to selling all government assets. (NAN)
