By Abubakar Ahmed Gusau – The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Zamfara, Alhaji Sani Shinkafi, on Wednesday confirmed that he has ejected all displaced persons taking shelter in his houses in Shinkafi for voting the APC in Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections. Shinkafi made the confirmation in Gusau at a news conference
organized by a coalition of some political parties in the state
protesting against the elections. “I have asked all the IDPs residing in my Shinkafi houses to immediately pack out because they are not serious in life. “These are people who had to leave their villages due to insecurity
caused by a government that could not provide such basic necessity to
them, yet they went and sold their votes at the last elections trying to
bring back the same gang,” he claimed. According to him, in spite earlier advise to the displaced persons
“to vote out those who failed them in the past years”, they still did. He claimed that the Internally Displaced Persons allowed themselves
to be bought over during the election by “the people who failed them.” Shinkafi said the coalition would not support the Resident Electoral
Commissioner (REC) and all security chiefs in the state to handle the
March 9, governorship and state assembly elections. “This is because we have no confidence in them and their ability to
be fair and just to us,” the APGA governorship candidate added. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the coalition is
comprised of the PDP, APGA, ACCORD, NRM, APP, ADC, NPP, DPP and YPP.
