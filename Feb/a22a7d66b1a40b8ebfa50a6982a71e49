Party (SDP), Olu Falae has resigned his position and also said he has decided
to quit politics. Responding on why he decided to quit politics and stepped down as Chairman at
this point in time, Falae cited health challenge as a major reason for his
action, TVC reports. Recall the Social Democratic Party (SDP) on Thursday announced its withdrawal
from the Feb. 16, presidential election due to what it described as long delay
experienced in tresolving party’s presidential tussle between two of its
members. The
party has also adopted President Muhammadu Buhari as its candidate. According to
NAN, the decision was part of the resolutions of the National Executive
Committee (NEC) meeting of the party in Abuja on Thursday. The NEC said, “We cannot campaign, we cannot do anything because of the
protracted legal issue and we feel that it is impeccable to technically
withdraw from the presidential election. “We want to
focus on the National Assembly, Governorship and State House of Assemblies
election for which we have fielded candidates across the country. “We are,
therefore, adopting the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential candidate,
President Muhammadu Buhari, as our preferred candidate for the Feb. 16
election.”
