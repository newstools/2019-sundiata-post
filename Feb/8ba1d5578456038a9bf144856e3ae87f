(NAN) in Abuja on Monday that Johnson-Sirleaf would be back to Nigeria
on Thursday. “You are asking of the observers; they were given the option of staying, most of them are staying. I do not know if some left. “I do not think the delegation is without her, she is probably returning with her delegation on Thursday.” Bara-Hart said that there were four members in her delegation from different parts of the region. NAN reports that the United Nations, Commonwealth, European Union,

supportive of the electoral process as INEC worked to implement its new
timeline. The missions also added that they would continue to closely observe preparations across the country. (NAN)
