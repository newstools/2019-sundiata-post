By Oluwabukola Akanni Ibadan – Mrs Adekemi Opatunde, the Senior Special Assistant to   Gov. Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State on Community Relations, says there is no truth in claims of using roadshow to manipulate voters. Opatunde made the clarification while addressing journalists on
Wednesday in Ibadan during the week-long campaign roadshow organised by
the governor’s wife, Mrs Florence Ajimobi. According to her, the roadshow, which include distribution of food
items, among others, is an appreciative gesture to people for their
support to Ajimobi-led administration since inception. “The roadshow is not a vote-buying, rather, we are trying to
appreciate the good people of state for their support in the last eight
years. “It also provides us with the opportunity to engage the people and
sensitise them on our plans in the next four years,’’ he said. Opatunde, while lauding the initiative of the governor’s wife,
described her as an exceptional and kind woman who has good intention
for people and the development of the state. She said that the senatorial ambition of the governor was a step in
the right direction, given Ajimobi’s experience and intellect. According to her, his election as a senator, representing Oyo South
Senatorial District, will attract further development to the state.
