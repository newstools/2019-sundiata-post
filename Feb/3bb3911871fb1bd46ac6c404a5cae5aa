Enugu – Security agencies on Wednesday beefed up security at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Enugu State headquarters in Enugu ahead of the Feb. 16 Presidential/National Assembly elections. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the heavy deployment of
security agencies personnel must be a fall out of the recent fire
outbreaks in INEC offices in Abia and Anambra, which are neighbouring
states to Enugu State. NAN correspondent, who visited the INEC headquarters in Enugu,
observed the arrival of a truck-load of mobile policemen, about 30
personnel, well-kitted and armed at INEC headquarters in Enugu. There was also deployment of an Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) in front of the office with stern looking mobile policemen. NAN also observed increased numbers of personnel of other sister
security agencies such as the Department of State Security and Nigeria
Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC). Reacting, the Commandant of NSCDC in Enugu State, Mr Steve Amoga,
told NAN that the increased number of security personnel to INEC offices
would ensure adequate security in all the commission’s offices in the
state. “Security agencies in the state have decided to provide additional
personnel in all INEC offices both at the headquarters and council areas
in the state. “We are now to provide 24/7 security to INEC office, its personnel as well as election materials. “It is a clear indication that we are out to support INEC to succeed
as well as ensure that electoral materials are secured,’’ Amoga said.
