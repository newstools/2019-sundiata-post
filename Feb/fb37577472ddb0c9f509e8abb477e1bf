By Funmilola Gboteku Lagos, – The Managing Director of Jumia’s Hotel and Flight Services, Mrs Omolara Adagunodo, on Friday urged the Federal Government to grant tax break to businesses in the hospitality industry. Adagunodo said that this was necessary because the hospitality
industry would contribute more than it is currently doing to Nigeria’s
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the economy, if granted tax break. She recalled that in 2017, the Federal Government released a list of
27 companies to enjoy the Federal Government tax break under pioneer
status and the hospitality sector was missing. “We encourage the Federal Government to include the hospitality
sector in the pioneer status so that the sector can also enjoy its many
benefits. “The hospitality sector is currently faced with an avalanche of
taxes: Registration of Hospitality Premises, Stamp Duty, Nigerian Social
Insurance Trust Fund (NSIT) and Industrial Training Fund (ITF). “Others taxes are: National Pension Commission (PENCOM), Nigerian
Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC), Value Added Tax (VAT), Pay As
You Earn (PAYE), and Company Income Tax, among others. “The Travel and Tourism sector accounted for 1.9 per cent of total
GDP as a direct contribution and 5.1 per cent as total contribution to
GDP in 2017. “In monetary terms, Travel and Tourism contributed N2.29 billion to
the GDP as a direct contribution and N6.20 billion as a total
contribution to the GDP, ‘’ Adagunodo said in a statement. She said that the sector directly generated 1.2 million jobs, which
was about 1.8 per cent of total employment and rose by 4.7 per cent in
2018 to 1.27 million. Adagunodo noted that the total jobs created both directly and
indirectly were 3.3 million, which was 4.8 per cent of total employment. “This percentage GDP contribution will significantly increase as
these businesses will invest the money on boosting service delivery and
overall improvement in the quality of business, ‘’ she said.
