T  The Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) has
ordered both the Inspector General of Police and the Director General of
the Department of State Services (DSS) to arrest of the suspended Chief
Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen. Delivering a ruling of the three-man tribunal, chairman of the CCT,
Danladi Umar, ordered the security agencies to produce Onnoghen at the
tribunal, on Friday. He dismissed the objection raised to the application for the issuance of the arrest warrant and ordered that “I want to see the defendant in the dock on Friday” ‎The CCT made the order following an application by the lead
prosecuting counsel, Mr. Aliyu Umar (SAN), who said the consistent
absence of the CJN from the CCT was a violation of provisions of the
Administration of Criminal Justice Act. Umar, who anchored his application for Onnoghen’s arrest on section
6(1) of the Practice Direction of the CCT, also opposed the call on the
three-man tribunal by the lead defence counsel, Chief Adegboyega Awomolo
(SAN), to hear all pending applications. He maintained that by virtue of section 396(2) of the Administration
of Criminal Justice Act 2015 no objections could be raised by the
defendant until he took his plea. The prosecuting counsel said Onnoghen having not taken his plea, the objection by him could not be heard. (Daily Sun)
