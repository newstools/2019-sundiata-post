By Victor Adeoti Osogbo – The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) on Monday said N10 million substandard and expired goods were confiscated and destroyed in Osun in 2018. Mr Jerome Umoru, the SON Coordinator in the state, disclosed this in
an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Osogbo. Umoru said the substandard goods were confiscated by SON officials
during the raid of some supermarkets and major markets in the state. He said items confiscated included consumables, used tyres, cables and gas cylinders among others. The SON boss said some of the confiscated goods were burnt in collaboration with the state environmental agency. Umoru, who expressed worry over the influx of expired products into
the market, said the organisation would not relent in enforcing
standards and standardisation of products in the markets. He urged consumers to always check for the manufacture and expiry dates of products before purchase. Umoru also warned those selling fake and expired products to desist
from the act, adding that the organisation would not relent in ensuring
the safety of consumers in the state. “We are sustaining our enforcement and compliance activities in the
state to ensure that expired goods in markets are reduced to the barest
minimum,’’ Umoru said.
