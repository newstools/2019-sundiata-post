Bogota – Tons of humanitarian aids sent from the U.S. to Venezuela are being held up on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao after Caracas closed air and sea routes to the island, Venezuelan and Colombian media reported. “No aid delivery will leave Curacao for Venezuela by force,” the daily El Universal quoted the island’s authorities as saying on Friday. The aid, which has been donated by Venezuelans living in the U.S., will be kept in storage until the government in Caracas gives it the green light to enter, the statement added. The news came as a stand-off intensified between opposition leader, Juan Guaido, whom dozens of countries have recognised as Venezuela’s interim president, and President Nicolas Maduro, whom Guaido is pressuring to resign. Guaido wants to bring in aid for hundreds of thousands of people who, he says, are at risk due to food and medicine shortages. Maduro wants to prevent the arrival of the aid, which he regards as a plot to disguise a U.S. military intervention. Curacao has been established as one of the hubs through which aid is set to be transported to Venezuela. The main aid collection centre is in the Colombian border city of Cucuta, while another one is being set up in Brazil. In addition to closing sea and air routes to Curacao, Maduro has sealed the long land border with Brazil and said he is also considering a closure of the Colombian border. The opposition, with the cooperation of several of Venezuela’s neighbours, wants to start bringing aid into Venezuela on Saturday, but it is not clear how they intend to do so. The Venezuelan army has blocked the Cucuta route by placing cargo containers on a border bridge there. (dpa/NAN)
