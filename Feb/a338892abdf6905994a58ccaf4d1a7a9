Beirut – The U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Elizabeth Richard on Tuesday expressed U.S. concerns over the growing role of Hezbollah in the new cabinet, the National News Agency (NNA) reported. “The U.S. has a very big concern over the growing role of Hezbollah,
which is not under the control of the government,’’ said Richard during
her visit to Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri. “Such state of affair does not contribute to stability and is fundamentally destabilising,” she added. The U.S. ambassador also highlighted her country’s constant support
for Lebanon to better deal with the inflow of a great number of Syrian
refugees. “We are also ready to help the country in building a capable and
respected military that protects its citizens under the sovereign
control of their elected leaders and in addressing a range of difficult
economic issues,’’ Richard said. (Xinhua/NAN)
