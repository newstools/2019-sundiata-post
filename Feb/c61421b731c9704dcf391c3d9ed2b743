Bogota – Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday rejected plans to send international humanitarian aid into his country as a “political show,” while preparations to deliver food and hospital supplies past soldiers guarding the border continued. The aid deliveries would be a disguise for a U.S. military
intervention in Venezuela, Maduro told broadcaster RT, warning that
imperialism only “causes deaths,” as happened in Afghanistan, Iraq,
Libya and Syria. Opposition leader, Juan Guaido, who has been recognised by many
American and European countries as Venezuela’s interim president, has
requested aid as his power struggle with Maduro has intensified. The U.S. has pledged 20 million dollars and Canada 53 million
Canadian dollars (40 million dollars), while the EU earmarked an
additional 5 million euros (5.7 million dollars) in aid. The EU had
already provided 34 million euros in 2018. The Venezuelan army has so far not responded to calls from the
opposition and American countries to side with Guaido and to allow the
entry of aid. Guaido has said that the aid will initially enter through Colombia and Brazil. The Colombian border city of Cucuta is preparing to receive aid
supplies coming from the capital, Bogota, according to local media
reports. Colombia is tackling “the necessary tasks for the aid to reach the
Venezuelan people,” Foreign Minister, Carlos Trujillo said late on
Tuesday after meeting his U.S. counterpart, Mike Pompeo, in Washington. U.S. National Security Adviser, John Bolton, meanwhile, met Brazilian
Foreign Minister, Ernesto Araujo at the White House, where they
discussed the logistics for the aid. (dpa/NAN)
