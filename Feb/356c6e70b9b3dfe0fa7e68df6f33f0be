By Moses Omorogieva Lagos – Police in Lagos said they had begun investigation into a case of rape reported against two friends, who allegedly took a 23-year-old girl to a club and raped her. Spokesman of the command, CSP Chike Oti, said in a statement on
Tuesday that the suspects, who had been apprehended took the victim to
Dallankester Hotels, Lekki, Phase One, on Friday. According to Oti, unknown to the victim that the duo had ulterior
motives, while at the club, they mixed the young woman’s drink with a
substance that made her weak and almost unconscious. ”Satisfied that the drug was beginning to affect the victim, they
quietly left the club with her to Dallankester Hotels in Lekki, owned by
the father of one of the suspects named Don-Chima George. ”At the hotel, they took turns to rape her. As if that wasn’t enough, they videoed the abuse. ”When the victim woke up from the induced sleep, she confronted the suspects who denied having carnal knowledge of her. ”Not satisfied, she placed a call to her elder brother complaining that she had been violated. ”The brother immediately invited policemen from Maroko Division led
by the Divisional Police Officer, CSP Isah Abdulmajid, to the scene. ”On searching the suspects, the DPO recovered their phones and went
through their video recordings where he saw a video of the suspects
sexually abusing the apparently unconscious victim,” he said. Oti said the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Edgal Imohimi,
had directed the Gender Section of the command to investigate and
prosecute the suspects to serve as deterrent to others. (NAN)
