By Benson Ezugwu Calabar, – The Cross River Government has approved N8.5 billion for the provision of electricity in over 400 communities across the 18 Local Government Areas of the state. Dr Jake Otu-Enyia, the Director-General of the State Electrification
Agency (SEA) made this known on Tuesday in Calabar during a visit to his
office by Mr Ayodele Adegoke, the State Coordinator of the National
Youth Service Corps (NYSC). He said that procurement processes had since commenced for the project. “This is in line with the Cross River State Executive Council’s
approval of 100 per cent electricity coverage across the state,’’
Otu-Enyia said. He said the current administration in the state had done well by
improving the electricity sub-sector including the direct intervention,
in the provision of electricity materials worth over N30 million in over
30 communities. The director-general, however, promised to send a team of engineers
to carry out a survey to ascertain the capacity of transformers required
by the NYSC Orientation Camp in Obubra Local Government Area. Otu-Enyia said he would communicate same to the governor for assistance. Earlier, the state coordinator of NYSC had requested for an
electricity transformer for the state’s NYSC permanent orientation camp. According to him, the camp had been in darkness for decades, hence the appeal for the state government’s intervention.
