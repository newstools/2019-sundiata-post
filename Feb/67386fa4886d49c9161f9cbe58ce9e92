By Ibrahim Kado Gombe – Mr David Markson, Coordinator National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Gombe State, has appealed to the general public to treat Corps members on duty during the forthcoming general election with respect. Markson made the plea in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Gombe. He said the corps members were young Nigerians posted for a special
national assignment; hence they should be protected against any attack. “I urge you to treat these corps members as your children and to protect them in the course of discharging their assignment. “Most of them don’t know the nooks and crannies of the communities
like your children who are serving in the other parts of the country,”
he said. He also appealed to the traditional and religious leaders to continue
to sensitise their people on the need for violence-free election to
attain credible results. “So I want to appeal to traditional rulers, religious leaders,
political parties and all the stakeholders to please take care of these
corps members and continue sensitising people on peaceful elections. He said the corps members were in the state to contribute their own
quarter to the development of the state and the country at large. According to him, over 4,000 corps members are to participate in the
election duty as presiding/assistant presiding officers and have been
trained by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
