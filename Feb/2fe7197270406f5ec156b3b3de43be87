By Joy Odigie Benin – The National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) says no fewer than 20,000 pupils in Edo will benefit from the Home Grown School Feeding Programme (HGSF). Ms Osayuwamen Aledeshelu, NSIP Focal Person in the state, made this
known on Wednesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
in Benin. Aledeshelu said 1,000 pupils in Uhunmwode Local Government area were
currently benefiting from the feeding programme inaugurated a month ago
in the state. “We are starting with two local government areas of Orhionmwon and
Uhunwonde. We target to feed over 20, 000 pupils in the state. “For now, our pilot school is Eyean Primary School in Uhunmwode and
pupils from primary one to six in the school are enrolled in the
programme,’’ she said. Aledeshelu said that the Ward Development Committees in the two local
governments would ensure monitoring of the programme to allow for
transparency and accountability. “We have an independent structure made up of environmental health
officers, agricultural officers and members of the ward development
committees to ensure the programme is properly managed and children eat
healthy foods,” she said. Aledeshelu added that over 30 farmers were currently linked to the feeding programme.
