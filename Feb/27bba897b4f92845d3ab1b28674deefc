By Yakubu Uba Hong – The Adamawa Governorship candidate of African Democratic Congress (ADC), Sen. Abdul-Aziz Nyako, has promised defectors from other parties to ADC greener pasture if he emerges as governor. Nyako made the promise on Saturday while receiving some defectors
from All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and
Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Uba Ward of Hong Local Government
Area. Nyako said the greener pasture would not only extend to them as
active participants in his election but the entire people of Adamawa who
would witness the revival of free healthcare, education, mechanised
agriculture and empowerment programmes. Also speaking, the State Chairman of ADC, Alhaji Yahaya Hammanjulde
promised the defectors equal treatment in ADC and full sense of
belonging. Hammanjulde lauded what he described as the popular acceptance of the
party at the grassroots and assured the people of full commitment by
the party’s candidate not to betray their confidence when elected. He pointed out that Sen. Nyako who is the serving senator
representing Adamawa Central Senatorial District had proved his worth as
a senator and would not fail as a governor. Hammanjulde noted that former Gov. Murtala Nyako did not fail the
people of Adamawa as a governor, saying that his son, Abdul-Aziz would
not fail them as well. “Already, his father, Murtala Nyako, whose tenure as governor of
Adamawa is always remembered will nostalgia is serving as a guarantor
that will ensure Abdul-Aziz performed when elected,’’ Hammanjulde said. Earlier, the party chairman in Hong Local Government, Malam Isa
Galadima, said the people of Hong were convinced that Abdul-Aziz, who is
their senator, would deliver as a governor if elected.
