By Millicent Ifeanyichukwu Lagos – Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos State governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says his administration will promote sports at all levels if elected by the people. Sanwo-Olu said this at a session with the Lagos State Chapter of
Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) on Wednesday at the SWAN
Secretariat, National Stadium, Lagos. ” We need to be creative in sports because honestly, Lagos has an
issue with space; we perhaps have to embrace more indoor sports and
multifaceted sports ground that can cater for multiple sports. “As part of the policy for recreation and Land regeneration and Town
Planning, we will ensure that private developers create sports grounds
at a minimum number of units of housing. “I will try my best to engage minds who have brilliant ideas to help
but can’t have access to the government for the needed support and see
what we can work out,” he said. Mr Debo Oshundun, Chairman of SWAN, Lagos Chapter, said it was a
tradition in the association for governorshp candidates of various
political parties to have such sessions to unveil their vision on
sports for the state. Oshudun said that Sanwo-Olu approached the body on the need to hold the session, to enable him to interact with SWAN members. “We had such visits from Musliu Obanikoro, Babatunde Fashola and
others, so what Sanwo-Olu did is expected and he has been able to tell
us what his sports vision is for Lagosians. “This is the reason for this forum and same forum is open for any
party candidate that wants to approach us like Sanwo-Olu did,” he said.
