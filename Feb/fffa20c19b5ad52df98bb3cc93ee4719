By Emmanuel Oloniruha Abuja – Former Minister of Information, Prof. Jerry Gana, has expressed concern about the recent fire incidents at offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in some parts of the country. Addressing newsmen in Abuja on Wednesday, Gana said the incidents might affect the credibility of the general elections. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
reports that INEC, had on Tuesday confirmed that 4,695 card readers
meant for Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections were
destroyed by fire at its office in Awka, Anambra. NAN further reports that in last 12
days, INEC offices in Isiala Ngwa and Qua’n Pan Local Government Areas
of Abia and Plateau respectively were razed by fire. Gana, a presidential aspirant under
the Social Democratic Party (SDP), said Nigerians were becoming “deeply
concerned and very fearful that the forthcoming elections may be
seriously compromised’’. While noting that no democracy could
function properly without credible elections, he urged INEC to do
everything within its powers to ensure the polls were free and fair. He also urged President Muhammadu
Buhari to address the alleged interference of security agencies in the
electoral process to guarantee the survival of the nation’s democracy. He said “We must not forget that
democracy was achieved on the sacrifices, labour and intense sweat of
patriotic Nigerians. Some had to pay the supreme price to restore
democracy in Nigeria. “This is why it becomes extremely
important that we, both the young and the elderly, must not sit by and
watch our democracy derailed. Never Again!’’. To this end, he urged Nigerians to come out en mass on Saturday and exercise their franchise without fear of intimidation. (NAN)
