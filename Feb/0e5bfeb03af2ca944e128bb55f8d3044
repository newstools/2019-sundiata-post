By Aisha Cole Lagos – The National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) has appealed to boat operators to desist from travelling on waterways after 6 p.m. in line with its safety guidelines. The NIWA General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Mr Tayo Fadile, made the
appeal while commiserating with Lagos State Government over a boat
mishap on Saturday at Bayeku in Ikorodu, Lagos State. “The boat which took off in the evening of Saturday from Okeranla in
Ajah heading to Bayeku in Ikorodu ran into a heap of a dredged sand and
capsized. “The Area Office of NIWA in Lagos, when contacted, immediately
deployed the water ambulance boat with the search and rescue team to the
scene of the mishap and the team were able to rescue 17 passengers
alive and three dead bodies. “We will like to appeal to the general public, especially waterways
users, to strictly adhere to NIWA safety guidelines, especially for boat
operators to stop traveling in the evening after 6 p.m.,” Fadile said. According to him, we were reliably informed by NIWA Lagos Area Office
that a 20-passenger boat owned by Mr Kasali, a member of Association of
Tourist Boat Operators and Water Transport of Nigeria (ATBOANTON) had
capsized. He, however, said that NIWA would continue to encourage boat
operators to do the right thing and reduce the incessant boat mishap on
the waterways by adhering to safety regulations as stipulated by NIWA.
