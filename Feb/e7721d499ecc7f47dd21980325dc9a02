By Naomi Sharang Abuja – The Federal Government has approved visa fee waiver for accredited observers and monitors of the nation’s upcoming general elections. Comptroller-General Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Mr Muhammad
Babandede, announced this in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday. He said that the waiver was sequel to the re-scheduling of the
general elections to Saturday for Presidential and National Assembly,
from Feb. 16, and March 9 for Governorship and House of Assembly, from
March 2. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) gave logistics
and operational problems as reasons for postponing the polls. Babandede said that waiver was in consideration of the plight of
accredited observers and monitors who were caught-up by the re-scheduled
elections. He urged all affected individuals and organisations wishing to extend
their stay or travel back to their countries and return for the next
elections to visit NIS Visa Desk at INEC Headquarters. “The desk officers will attend to those requiring extension of their visas issued Gratis (No Fee Charge). “This provision became necessary to afford those affected, the
opportunity to travel out or return without violating the immigration
provisions that relates to entry and exit with valid visa and document.”
