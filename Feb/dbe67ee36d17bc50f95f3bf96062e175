By Ijendu Iheaka Aba – The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has raided 30 hard drug black spots in Abia and arrested 39 persons in the last three months. Mr Bamidele Akingbade, the commander of the agency in state disclosed this to newsmen in Aba on Tuesday. He said that the raid and arrest of the suspects took place between
Dec. 2018 and Feb., adding that those involved included 34 males and 5
females. He listed towns raided to include Umuahia, Aba, Ohafia, Arochukwu and Isiukwuato areas of the state. He said drugs ranging from cannabis, skonk cannabis, cocaine, heroin and other psychotropic substances were found on them. Other things found on them, according to him are stimulants and
depressants like tramadol, rophenol, diazepam, benelyn and codeine. He said the agency also recovered eight locally-made single and double barrel guns and one pistol from one the suspects. He said the command initiated the raid across the state with the
intention to keep the state safe prior to the upcoming general
elections. “The action of the command is hinged on the premise that the line between violence and drug is thin. “We have observed in the past, most of the past violent behaviours
that characterised past elections have not been unconnected with the use
of drugs. “We could safely say that it is not impossible that some politicians
may be planning again to induce our youths into violence in order to
make them susceptible to violent behaviours. “They may want to foment troubles during campaigns and elections by making hard drugs freely available to them,” he said. He said those caught with the banned substances had been arraigned in
courts while one case involving fire arm recovery had been transferred
to the police for further investigation. He said other cases involving drug abuse had also been properly
documented and suspects counselled and released to their parents and
caretakers.
