The governor said that his administration remained resolute in boosting the growth of small scale industries in Abia and the nation at large. He said  that under his watch, the state would continue to initiate more schemes and priviledges that would yield increased participation of the people of Abia in small scale enterprise. He described the people of Bende as key players in the small scale manufacturing sector of the Abia economy.
