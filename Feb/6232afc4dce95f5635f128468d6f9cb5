PDP has rejected the results of last Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections being announced by INEC. . . The party’s National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, who addressed a press conference in Abuja, described the figures being announced by INEC as incorrect and totally unacceptable. . . He alleged that the current administration “colluded” with INEC and security agencies to manipulate results from polling units across the country. . . “Our collation centres have the original results from all the polling units in the country. That is from where are going to reclaim our results,” he said. . . “The results are incorrect and unacceptable to our party. Officials of the APC working with INEC have decided to alter results to affect our people. This must now be resisted by every well-meaning Nigerian. . . INEC must live up to its responsibility. They are under pressure. We have the facts and when the time comes, we begin to release them.” . . Secondus added the PDP will update Nigerians “as time goes on” regarding their decisions in other states yet to be announced.
