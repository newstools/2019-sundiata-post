Berlin – More than two-thirds of Germans are in favour of a complete ban on advertising for tobacco products, a study released on Monday showed. Sixty-nine per cent of respondents to a survey commissioned by the
German Insurance Association (said they would favour a ban, while only
27 per cent said they were against it. A slightly smaller majority of 58 per cent said they would welcome a
ban on alcohol advertising, with 36 per cent of respondents against it. A majority of 75 per cent said they would welcome higher taxes on tobacco and 59 per cent said the same for alcohol. The survey included a representative sample of 1,003 people over the
age of 18, who were interviewed by the Forsa research institute between
Feb. 4 and  Feb. 8. In Germany, a debate about advertising harmful substances has been continuing apace for several years. Under the previous government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, an attempt
to enshrine a ban on tobacco advertising in law failed due to
opposition from her conservative bloc.
