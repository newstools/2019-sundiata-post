All this anti-INEC gra-gra by Oshiomhole and the APC is the predictable tantrum of a rejected political group. They wanted a staggered election, which is easier to manipulate. The INEC chairman instead postponed the entire election, which threw a kink into their plans. The INEC chairman that is still their man and in is bed with them suddenly does something reasonable under international and local pressure to mitigate his incompetence and Oshiomhole is foaming at the mouth. Now he says he is willing to swear on the Qur’an to make the claim that INEC is colluding with the PDP. I thought Oshiomhole was a Catholic, albeit a converted one. If you must swear, and if you’re sure of your silly allegation, why not swear on the Bible, the holy book of your religion? When a man is going down, sometimes he can’t even remember his own name let alone his religion.
