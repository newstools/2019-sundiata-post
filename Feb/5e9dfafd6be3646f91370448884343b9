By Rita Iliya Minna – Mrs Theresa Arokoyo, Coordinator of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Niger, has urged security agencies to synergise for peaceful elections in the state. She made the call during a dialogue session on “Peace and
Violent-Free 2019 General Elections’’, organised by the National
Orientation Agency (NOA) in Minna on Monday. Arokoyo, who was represented by Mrs Mary Eghieye, Assistant Director,
Corps Inspection and Monitoring in Niger, called for cooperation of
stakeholders and the general public to shun violence during and after
the elections. She noted that peaceful and violence-free elections would enable corps members to discharge their duties freely. Arokoyo appealed to security agencies to make adequate provisions of
security for corps members at various polling centres and urged corps
members to be non-partisan during the exercise. Earlier, Alhaji Aliyu Mohammed, the Director of NOA in Niger, called
on the general public to shun acts capable of disrupting the conduct of
elections in state.
