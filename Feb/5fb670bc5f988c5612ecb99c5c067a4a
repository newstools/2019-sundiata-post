By Isaac Aregbesola Abuja – The U.S embassy has denied a tweet credited to U.S. Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, where he reportedly gave negative comment about the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. The Embassy, in its twitter account @USEmbassyAbuja, accessed by the
News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja, said such statement
should be regarded as fake news. The tweet, which the embassy classified as fake news read: “I
personally refused to meet him or have anything to do with him (Atiku). “I am really surprised that an individual indicted by the United
States of America of huge corruption is being considered for Nigerian
president…U.S. Secretary of State, Michael R. Pompeo” The embassy said such statement in either facebook or received via WhatsApp should be regarded as fake. “FakeNews Alert! If you have seen such manufactured content on
@facebook, or received it via @WhatsApp. Please communicate that it’s
fake news,” the embassy stated. (NAN)
