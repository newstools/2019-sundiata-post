By Zainab Oyekan Jos – Mr Joseph Ari, Director-General, Industrial Training Fund (ITF), has called for a review of  the curriculum in Nigeria’s schools to meet current challenges. “There is the need to review the curriculum in schools to ensure more
focus on the development of basic skills to meet present and future
challenges of globalization. “As a nation, our curriculum was faulty from the beginning; too much
emphasis was placed on paper qualification rather than skills
acquisition. “We have graduates of engineering who are unable to handle simple
machines. They know the theories but lack basic skills knowledge,” Ari
told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Thursday in Jos. The ITF boss suggested that more attention should be paid to
empowering people with relevant skills right from the kindergarten
stage. “Our curriculum must be restructured to meet the needs of the
country; we must strive to reduce poverty by encouraging skills for
income generation. “Young Nigerians need a curriculum that will encourage high participation in technical and vocational education,” he said. He said that the ITF had carried out a research and found two gaps –
skills in metals and solid minerals industry and skills on the
agro-allied industry. “As a nation, we cannot grow without skills. Practical skills remain
the greatest thing and will always be relevant if we must make progress
as a nation because without skills, you cannot achieve anything,” he
explained. He, however, said that imparting skills was capital intensive. “Imparting skills is capital intensive, but the ITF, with the support
of the Federal Government, has made huge progress in providing skills
across the country,” he said, and commended the efforts of state
governments in the training of the youths.
