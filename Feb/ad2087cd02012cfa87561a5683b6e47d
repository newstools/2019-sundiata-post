Washington – U.S. President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, will be sentenced for bank and tax fraud on March 8, according to a court filing posted on Thursday. This was just days before he is due to be sentenced in a separate case for lobbying violations. Manafort, 69, could spend the rest of his life in prison for charges
stemming from his work as an international political consultant and
lobbyist. He is one of the first people in Trump’s orbit to face criminal
charges stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation
into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Mueller is urging a federal judge in Virginia to impose a prison
sentence of up to 24 years and a fine of up to 24 million dollars, after
a jury found Manafort guilty of trying to hide millions of dollars. Manafort trying to hide millions of dollars he earned as a consultant
for pro-Russian leaders in Ukraine, and lying to banks to secure loans
to fund his lavish lifestyle after that income dried up. Manafort is also due to be sentenced on March 13 in a parallel federal case in Washington. He pleaded guilty in 2018 to conspiracy against the U.S. for conduct
that ranged from money laundering to unregistered lobbying and admitted
to witness tampering as well. But U.S. Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled last week that he violated
his plea deal by lying to prosecutors, which removes their obligation to
ask for a lighter sentence. Legal experts say he faces up to a decade in prison for those crimes.
In the bank and tax fraud case, Manafort has until March 1 to submit a
filing arguing for a lighter sentence to U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis
in Alexandria, Virginia. Mueller’s office will be able to file a reply to Manafort’s memo by March 6. Russia denies meddling in the election. Trump has said there was no
collusion between his Republican campaign and Russia, and has labeled
Mueller’s investigation a witch hunt. (Reuters/NAN)
