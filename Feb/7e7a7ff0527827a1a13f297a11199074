By Dorcas Elusogbon Ile-Ife (Osun) – The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has urged the Commissioner of Police in Osun, Mrs Abiodun Ige,  to ensure a peaceful atmosphere during the conduct of the general elections in the state. The monarch, Ojaja II, spoke in Ile-Ife, Osun, on Wednesday, when
the Commissioner of Police paid a courtesy visit to his palace. He welcomed the Commissioner to the ancient city of Ile-Ife, saying
that everybody recognised Osun as a state of virtue where people behave
well. Oba Ogunwusi advised her to maintain the state’s security
architecture and help maintain the peace during the upcoming general
elections in the state. The first class traditional ruler appealed to residents of the state
to support the new Commissioner in all ramifications, to enable her to
succeed in her assignment. Earlier, the Commissioner, Mrs Ige, consented that Osun was distinct
among other states in terms of peace as she had been informed. Ige said that the security personnel would do everything possible to maintain law and order in the state. She pledged to work diligently with all honesty in order to sustain
peaceful co-existence across the state before, during and after the
general elections.  (NAN)
