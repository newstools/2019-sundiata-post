By Nefishetu Yakubu Benin, – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is yet to commence collation of the results of presidential election nearly 24 hours after voting ended in the state, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. NAN reports there was no activity at the state INEC office on Ikpoba
Hill, except for the presence of some journalists waiting for the
commencement of the exercise, as well as security personnel. A senior INEC officer told NAN that while only the presidential
election result would be collated at the headquarters, the National
Assembly election results would be collated and announced at designated
collation centres in the three senatorial districts. NAN reports that stakeholders, including politicians and security
chiefs had commended the peaceful conduct of Saturday’s presidential and
national assembly elections across the 18 local government areas of the
state. Meanwhile, collation of national assembly election results was in
progress in the three districts of Edo South, Edo Central and Edo North.
