By Shuaib Sadiq Kaduna – Barely three days to the deadline for the collection of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Tuesday, said 333,610 PVCs were yet to be collected in Kaduna State The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Alhaji Kaugama Abdullahi,
made the disclosure to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kaduna. Abdullahi said INEC had registered 3,932,492 voters in the state,
with 3,598,882 PVCs already collected leaving a balance of 333,610 PVCs
yet to be collected as at Monday, February 4. The Commissioner said that the distribution of the PVCs was going on
in all INEC offices across the 23 local government areas in the state
and would terminate on February 8. Meanwhile, the Resident Commissioner said INEC had created 8,012
Voting Points within the existing 5,102 Polling Units in the 255 wards
to ease voting in the state. According to him, many of the polling units were congested, with some
having more than 2000 voters, a situation that necessitated the
creation of the voting points to ensure that eligible voters exercise
their franchise with ease. “ The maximum number of voters in each Polling Unit (PU) is 750
persons, that is the reason why we created the voting points within the
PUs for smooth exercise.”
