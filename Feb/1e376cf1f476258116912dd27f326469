Olusola Oke Akure – The Chairman of Ondo state chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Ade Adetimehin, has described the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari, as a robust victory for economic and infrastructure development in the country. He stated this in a statement by Mr Alex Kalejaiye, the state publicity secretary of the party, on Wednesday in Akure. “The re-election of Buhari for a second term, against all odds,
affirms the acceptance of the APC, and acknowledgment of his
performance.
“I have no doubt that with his re-election, Nigeria will be taken to the
next level of economic prosperity, infrastructure development, and
political stability,” he said.
He described the coming of Buhari and his deputy, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo,
as divine arrangement for the emancipation of the country once invaded
by political holocaust.
The chairman commended Nigerians for voting for integrity, sincerity and
development, rather than falling for orchestrated propaganda and
massive deceit.
“We also appreciated the good people of the state for standing by the
party, and urged them to vote for the party in the forthcoming state
House of Assembly election.
“I acknowledge the fact that the party made some political blunders in
the state in the just-concluded election, but those wrong steps will be
corrected in the upcoming election,” he said.(NAN) By Nicholas Dechi Makurdi - A Benue-based businessman, Mr Terlumun Nahanga, said social programmes initiated… By Yakubu Uba Yola - The Director, Field Operations of President Muhammadu Buhari Campaign Organisation,… Abuja (Sundiata Post) - There were wild jubilation in Zaria, Kaduna State on Wednesday over…
