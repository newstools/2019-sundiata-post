Rome – Aleksander Ceferin has revealed first details of a new UEFA streaming service and hopes to build bridges with FIFA after his re-election as president of the European football governing body. The 51-year-old Slovenian was elected for a four-year term by
acclamation as the only candidate standing at the 43rd UEFA congress in
Rome on Thursday. “Thank you once again for placing your trust in me, I am both touched
and honoured,’’ Ceferin told delegates from the 55 member-nations. “We are fully aware that a revolution is underway, and are in the
process of agreeing historic partnerships with the world’s leading
companies in this field,’’ he said in reference to a digital platform
called OTT. Commercial partner Alibaba could be involved in what Ceferin said were “new football technologies or joint e-commerce projects.” He took charge of UEFA in 2016 to complete the term of previous
president Michel Platini who was banned for receiving a disputed
payment. As UEFA president Ceferin is also assured of a vice-president post within world governing body FIFA. The two organisations have clashed recently over FIFA president
Gianni Infantino’s ambitions for a new global Nations League and a
revamped Club World Cup. “We will be a source of constructive ideas for FIFA, rather than one of opposition. “We are ready to work with the world governing body to ensure that
football remains the world’s number one sport, and that Europe continues
to lead the way,’’ Ceferin said. He also encouraged a European bid for the 2030 World Cup after coming
editions in Qatar (2022) and the U.S., Mexico and Canada (2026)
