D Abuja (Sundiata Post) –
National spokesperson of the , Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP),
Imo Ugochinyere has alarm over alleged plot by the Department of State Services
(DSS) to arrest him any moment from now. Ugochinyere made the
allegation at a press conference in Abuja, on Thursday. According to him, the
plan was to arrest him and keep him away until after elections because he was
in possession of copies of asset declaration forms of some top government
officials, including that of the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Ibe
Kachikwu. He said he had earlier
been approached on the need for him to reduce his opposition to the government. Ugochinyere said, “It is
important that the world takes note of this. Just about two hours ago, I was
informed the DSS had perfected arrangements to arrest me any moment from now. “It is important that I
tell the world the reason behind this move. I have been approached by people in
government to reduce the level of my opposition to government, but I cannot
betray the trust of the people. “The problem is that
they are aware that the opposition parties are in possession of asset
declaration forms of key members of the administration, especially that of the
Minister of State, Petroleum, Ibe Kachikwu. “What they want to do is
to stop me from releasing those documents.” Ugochinyere claimed that
a review of the forms showed that the affected ministers did not make full
disclosure in their assets. He claimed that the
government did not want such documents published because that was the same
reason cited to suspend the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen. Source: Daily Post
