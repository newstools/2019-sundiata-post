By Fortune Abang Yola, – Dr Kechi Ogbuagu, President of Conversations for Change (C4C), an NGO, has urged Nigerians not to be deterred by the postponement of elections, but vote on Saturday to avoid voter apathy. Ogbuagu, who gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Yola, said that the postponement of the
Saturday Presidential and National Assembly election was unexpected. She, however, decried the attitude of some Nigerains who she said
usually abstain from voting during election, reminding them that such
attitude would not promote democratic growth and the development of the
country. “Nigerians need to come out enmasse and cast their votes for candidates to enable them choose leaders of their choice. “Voting is the only power you have  to enthrone good leaders and bring about good governance in the country. “Not voting can have negative impact because your vote will not
count; so you must come out and cast your vote to move the nation
forward. “If that is done, it will become easy to follow up electoral
processes and also if election has been rigged or not,” Ogbuagu said. The President of the NGO described voting as the fundamental right of every citizen from 18 years and above. NAN reports that INEC announced the shift in date for the polls,
barely five hours to commencement of the elections over logistics and
operational problems.
