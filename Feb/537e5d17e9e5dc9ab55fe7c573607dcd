By Joseph Edeh Abuja – A former Commissioner of Police, Mr Lawrence Alobi, says intelligence gathering and sharing is vital in tackling insurgency. Alobi in an interview with News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Abuja, said information management
was also crucial to the fight against insurgency. He added that intelligence gathering would enable the military to penetrate various insurgents’ cells across the country. “ These Boko Haram elements have
international link and intelligence sharing will go a long way in
breaking their strongholds,“ he said. Alobi said that if the military
formations were fortified, the insurgents would be unable to carry out
attacks, adding that an attack on the military was an attack on the
nation. He said that the insurgents were known to carry out attacks on soft targets where they won’t meet any resistance. Alobi said that capacity building for personnel of the military would go a long way to help the military fight insurgency. On the performance of the police, he said that training and modern technology would enable the police to perform optimally. He said that the 21st century policing was technically-driven and as such police personnel to be trained. “If the police are trained, they will perform optimally and carry out their duties with human rights in their minds,“ he said.
