By Ige Adekunle Sango-Ota – The Itori Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun is to increase its patrol teams along the Itori axis and its environs, to stem crashes in the area. Mr Sunday Oko, the new-deployed Itori Unit Commander of FRSC disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota, Ogun, on Saturday. Oko stressed the need for more presence of the FRSC patrol teams along Itori and its environs, in order to check the excesses of motorists and improve the response time, in accident cases. “The level of public enlightenment by the former unit commander was very high but I intend to improve upon that by engaging in pre-trip enlightenment campaigns at the motor parks,” he said. Oko added that the command would collaborate more with the Ogun Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), to safe more lives and property from crashes. The unit commander also said the command would mobilise community members in the vicinity to be safety conscious through regular enlightenment in churches, mosques, as well as in the market places. Oko further said that he would maintain cordial relationships with stakeholders, especially hospitals, so that accident victims would always receive prompt treatment.
