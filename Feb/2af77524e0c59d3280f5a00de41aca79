By Kabir Muhammad Abuja – The Education Secretariat of the Federal Capital Territory Administration ((FCTA) has ordered an internal investigation into the alleged child abuse at Abuja School for the Deaf, in Kuje. In a statement on Tuesday in Abuja by Assistant Director (Information) of the secretariat, Mr Anthony Ogunleye, the secretariat expressed deep concern over the allegation. “The attention of the FCT Education Secretariat has been drawn to the alleged abuse of a pupil of the Abuja School for the Deaf, Kuje, as broadcast by an Abuja-based radio station. “The Secretary for Education is deeply concerned by the very serious allegation, especially since the well-being of a minor is concerned. “While the highly emotional broadcast has prompted an investigation by the Nigerian Police, the Secretary for Education has also ordered an internal investigation into the matter,’’ Ogunleye said. He said while the secretariat awaits the outcome of the investigation by the law enforcement agencies, the management assured all parents and guardians that their children and wards are safe in their various schools. “We, therefore, enjoin them to remain calm and all inquiries can be sent to either the Secretary for Education or the Chairman, FCT Universal Basic Education Board,’’ he said.(NAN)
