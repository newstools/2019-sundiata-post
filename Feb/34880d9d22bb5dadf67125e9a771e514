By Tukur Muntari Kano – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has signed an agreement with National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and National Road Transport Owners (NARTO) on the transportation of election materials in Kano state. INEC Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Kano State, Alhaji Garba
Lawal-Mohamned, said this in an interview with the News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN) in Kano on Saturday. He said under the agreement, over 3, 000 vehicles would be provided
by the two organisations for the transportation of INEC personnel and
election materials across the state. “The commission will use over 3,000 vehicles to distribute election
materials and transport the electoral officials to all the local
government areas of the state,” he said.
He said officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) had commenced
inspection of the vehicles with a view to ascertaining their road
worthiness.
He explained that the vehicles would also be used to transport back both
the election materials and personnel to the state headquarters of the
commission after the exercise.
Lawal-Mohamned urged officials of the two organisations to give the
commission the necessary support and cooperation to ensure the success
of the exercise.
NAN reports that no fewer than 51, 000 recruited ad-hoc staff have so far been trained ahead of the elections.
