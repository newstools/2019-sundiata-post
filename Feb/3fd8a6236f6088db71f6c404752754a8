By Ariwodola Idowu Ado Ekiti – Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi on Sunday said he remained grateful to God for the outcome of the peaceful conduct of Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections in the State. The ruling APC in the state has already won two senatorial and two
House of Representative in results of the election declared so far by
INEC. Fayemi expressed gratitude to Ekiti people for their peaceful and orderly conduct during the election. The governor gave the commendation during Sunday service at the
Government House Chapel, with Prince Dayo Adeyeye, Senator-Elect for
Ekiti Central District. Others present at service are member-Elect, House of Representatives,
Ekiti Central 1, Mr Sola Fatoba and Prof. Dupe Adelabu, a former Deputy
Governor of the state. The Governor, who recalled that the congregation prayed for the
peaceful conduct of the general elections, said that God had indeed
answered the prayers as the elections were held in a peaceful atmosphere
in the state. He however sympathised with families of victims of election violence
as reported in some parts of the country, while urging Nigerians to
always seek for peace at all time. Fayemi also urged winners in the election to be humble and focus on service delivery. He advised them to see their victory as a product of God’s grace and not as a result of their efforts. “We have every reason to thank God for the peaceful conduct of the election in Ekiti State. “Two weeks ago, the congregation raised prayer points concerning the
peaceful conduct of the election in our state and God indeed answered
our prayers. “We pray for the repose of the lives lost during the election in some
parts of the country and pray that peace will reign supreme in the
country. “While I rejoice with the winners, I will also urge them to be
humble, should realise that they could not have won by their power but
by God’s grace.’’
