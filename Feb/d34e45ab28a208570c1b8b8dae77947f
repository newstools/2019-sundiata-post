Geneva – South Korea is looking forward to “tangible and substantial” results from this week’s summit in Hanoi between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The South Korean Foreign Minister, Kang Kyung, said this in Geneva on Monday. She, however, declined to comment on whether the meeting could include a formal declaration on ending the 1950-1953 Korean War. She said: “We are hopeful of a substantial outcome, both on the side
of the denuclearisation as well as on the side of the corresponding
measures from the United States’’.
