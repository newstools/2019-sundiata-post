Lagos – The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) on Sunday says investigation has began into Saturday’s crash landing of an helicopter conveying Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo in Kabba, Kogi State. Mr Sam Adurogboye, General Manager, Public Relations, confirmed the development to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. Adurogboye said the investigation was being conducted by the Accident
Investigations Bureau (AIB), the statutory agency saddled with the task
of investigating such serious incidents and accidents. “The NCAA has been notified about the incident and we have notified
the AIB to begin investigations in line with its mandate” Adurogboye
said. A source also told NAN on the condition of anonymity that the AIB had
already deployed its team of investigators to the crash site to
ascertain the remote and immediate cause of the incident. Also confirming the development, Caverton Helicopters, in a statement
signed by its Managing Director, Capt. Josiah Choms, said the relevant
aviation agencies had been informed about the incident. Choms said “An Augusta AW139 Helicopter, under management by Caverton
Helicopters was involved in a mishap on landing in Kabba, Kogi State on
Feb. 2 as a result of unusual weather conditions. “There were no injuries to the passengers or crew on board and they were all quickly and safely evacuated. “The relevant authorities have been duly informed and an
investigation into the incident has commenced. We will, of course,
support the authorities as required. “We wish to reassure the public and our various stakeholders of our
unwavering commitment to safety in all our operations,” he said. NAN reports that Osinbajo and his entourage had crash landed in Kabba
when he visited the town for his Next-Level engagements with the
people. However, the incident did not deter the Vice President from
continuing with his engagements according to a statement issued by his
Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr Laolu Akande.
