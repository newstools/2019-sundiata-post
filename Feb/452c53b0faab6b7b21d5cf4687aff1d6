By Friday Idachaba Ankpa â€“ Dr Victor Adoji, the African Democratic Congress (ADC), senatorial candidate for Kogi East has promised to make Kogi assume oil producing status if elected. Adoji, who made the promise while addressing members and supporters
of the party in Ankpa on Wednesday, also promised massive infrastructure
development of Kogi East senatorial district if given the mandate. He said that proper exploration of the crude oil deposits on the soil
of Kogi, particularly in Ibaji Local Government Area, would ensure
listing of the state in the comity of oil producing states. The banker-turned politician re-assured the people that exploration
of the coal deposits in the area without compensation would end if he
was voted to represent the district. He also promised to re-direct efforts toward the completion of
Bagana-Guto Bridge in Omala Local Government Area to open up the area
for accelerated development of the whole of Igala-Bassa land. The senatorial candidate expressed appreciation to leaders and people
of Igala-Bassa land for endorsing him as their candidate and pledged to
work relentlessly for the development of the district. Speaking earlier, Anthony Itodo, ADC chairman in Ankpa urged the
senatorial candidate to remain focused in the pursuit of his ambition to
effectively represent the district. Itodo who said the senatorial district had lost its voice in the last
eight years due to poor representation, held that with Adoji in the
senate, Igala-Bassa voice would be heard loud and clear. The party chairman commended the senatorial candidate for making
himself available for the great task ahead stressing that with his
knowledge of the socio-economic problems facing Igala-Bassa land
emancipation of the district was sure.
