By Wandoo Sombo Abuja – The Federal High Court Abuja, on Tuesday, adjourned the ongoing trial of former Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) Spokesman, Olisa Metuh, until March 4, just as the prosecution complained that he was prolonging his defence. The Prosecutor, Mr Sylvanus Tahir, noted that there must be an end to
the defence, adding that Metuh had been giving evidence in his defence
since July 6, 2018. Tahir further stated that most of what Metuh was stating in his defence was irrelevant to the case. Responding, Metuh’s counsel, Mr Emeka Etiaba (SAN) stated that no one could force a defendant to close a case. Etiaba said that a defendant would not jeopardise himself by giving
irrelevant evidence, adding that all of Metuh’s evidence was relevant. The judge, Justice Okon Abang, noted that the defendant had the right
to continue giving evidence but urged that the evidence be confined to
things that were relevant to the case. Abang, however, adjourned the matter until March 4.
