By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu – The Southern Nigeria Peoples Mandate (SNPM) on Tuesday, urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ignore calls by political parties for the postponement of election beyond Feb. 23. INEC on Saturday postponed the
Presidential/National Assembly elections billed for Feb. 16 to Feb. 23
and attributed its decision to logistics and operational challenges. The National President of SNPM, Mr
Augustine Chukwudum, made the call while speaking with the News Agency
of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu. Chukwudum said that some political
party leaders calling for the further postponement of election were
doing a lot of disservice to the nation. He said: “I do not think the candidates of these political parties are really contesting elections. “These are politicians looking for
means of livelihood from the two serious contenders, Atiku Abubakar and
President Muhammadu Buhari. “Every Nigerian knows that only these two men are contesting for the number one seat.’’ The SNPM boss also called on the
incoming National Assembly to amend the Constitution so that the country
could have only five political parties. “This is because this multi-party system makes the country to waste billions of naira on every election.’’
