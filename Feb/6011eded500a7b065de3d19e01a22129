By
Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Tukur
Buratai, has said that there would be no military escorts for politicians,
especially retired military officers, during the general elections. The Army Chief stated this at a meeting with principal officers
and commanders of the Nigerian Army where he directed Commanders to ensure the
restrictions of movement within their commands and also carry out a stop and
search, anyone found culpable should be handed over to the police. He said the Army is taking a proactive approach to stop election
crimes such as ballot box snatching and violence and further directed
Commanders to deal decisively with anyone caught doing anything that will be
inimical to the success of the election. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had earlier ordered security
operatives to “deal ruthlessly” with anyone who attempts to snatch ballot box
during the rescheduled general elections on Saturday, February 23, 2019. The President said he had ordered security agencies to prepare
to crack down on potential trouble makers during the rescheduled elections. He said that he had briefed the law enforcement agencies,
particularly the military and police, who have identified the hot spots and
flashpoints. Gen. Buratai, however, warned that should any officer have any
doubt as to his or her loyalty to the Nigerian state, such a person has until
February 22, 2019, to resign.
