Enugu â€“ The Enugu State Fire Service quick response on Thursday averted an inferno that would have razed the Permanent Trade Fair Complex on Enugu-Onitsha Expressway in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) gathered that the source of the fire was traced to a nearby burning bush. The spokesperson of the Enugu Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines
and Agriculture (ECCIMA), Mr Uche Mba told NAN that quick intervention
from the state fire service and shop owners at the complex saved the
fire from spreading to the complex. Mba said that only one shop was torched adding that there was no recorded casualty. He thanked the fire service for preventing what would have been a disaster to the chamber and the state in general. The spokesperson warned the public against bush burning and urged
relevant government agencies to urgently address the situation. Efforts to reach the state Chief Fire Officer, Mr Okwudiri Ohaa
failed as his phone was not reachable as at the time of this report.
