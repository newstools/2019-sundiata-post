By Constance Imasuen Abuja – Abuja GSM Village Handsets & Accessories Association has appealed to government to train their members to have more knowledge in Information Communication Technology (ICT). The association’s Chairman, Mr Chris Eze, made the call on Friday in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, He said that the association had been seeking for partnership with government agencies to train its members. He added that “we have been seeking for partnership with government
agencies to train our members but till now, nothing has been done. “We have written to some government agencies but they are yet to reply. “When some of our members are trained, they will in turn train others and that will help us alot.” Eze said that most of the traders in the GSM market were youths and they constitute majority of the workforce in the country. He added that “these youths are eager to work, as they can do anything to survive so we are appealing to government to assist
us in training them. Once they learn a job and have the skill, they can help themselves and their families and ultimately help
to reduce the burden on the society.” The chairman said that controlling youths was a difficult task “and to do this, we have to use diplomacy to ensure they abide
by the rules put in place.” He, therefore, said that the association had constituted a taskforce to enforce law and order in the market. He, however, added that “the association hands over cases it cannot handle to the police.”
