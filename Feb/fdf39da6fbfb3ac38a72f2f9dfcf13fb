By Polycarp Auta Jos – The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) on Thursday in Jos stressed the need for exporters to be trained on ways to effectively export their products. Mr Christian Elekwa, the Regional Coordinator, North Central Office
of the council, said this at a one-day clinic to train newly registered
exporters in Plateau on export trade. Elekwa said the clinic would avail the newly registered exporters the opportunity to acquire more knowledge on export trade. “This workshop is necessitated by our observation that majority of
the newly registered exporters are not aware of our programmes and
activities that are meant to assist them in their export business. “This development impacts negatively on their export because
information gap have hindered many companies from exporting their
products. “It is in the light of the foregoing that we organise this programme
from time to time for newly registered exporters with a view of
educating and enlightening them on our activities, “This will also improve their knowledge and it will induct them into export trade,” he said. The coordinator expressed optimism that the programme would impact
positively on the participants and would make them conversant with the
dynamics of export trade. The training was titled: “Understanding Export Trade”.
