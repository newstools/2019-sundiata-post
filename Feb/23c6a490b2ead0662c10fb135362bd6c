Tempers rose at Stadium Roundabout, Kaduna, on Saturday morning as soldiers prevented some voters from accessing their polling units. The soldiers had prevented residents of the southern part of Kaduna metropolis whose polling units are located in the various places at the city centre. At their road block at the Roundabout, the soldiers stopped people from driving to the city centre, saying saying that they had orders from above not to allow movement. Displaying their PVCs, the voters started chanting “Buhari Must Go” and insisted that nobody would stop them from accessing their polling units. The soldiers also attempted to seize mobile phones from journalists who were taking pictures of the incident, but they stood their ground, insisting that they were performing their constitutional duties like soldiers as well. The intervention of a senior army officer averted a major situation. The officer ordered that all those with their PVCs should be allowed to pass. Meanwhile, Nasir el-Rufai, the state governor, and Adeniyi Oyebade, a major general and commandant of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), queued among hundreds of voters in their polling unit 024, Runka/Marnona opposite NDA, Anguwan Sarki, Kaduna North LGA. El-Rufai was in the queue for hours as the card readers failed in his unit. (THE CABLE)
