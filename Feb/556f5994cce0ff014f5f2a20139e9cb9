By Tukur Muntari Kano – The Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) Kano State Command, has deployed no fewer than 3,000 personnel to provide security during the rescheduled election in the state. The Commandant Shuaiyb Jibril-Mahmud disclosed this to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in an interview in Kano on Monday. Jibril-Mahmud said the officers were expected to work in
collaboration with other security agencies in the state during the
rescheduled Presidential and National Assembly Election slated for Feb.
23. “As you know during elections, the NSCDC normally complements other security agencies in ensuring peace and order. “It is the same this time as our officers will be deployed to all the
44 local government areas with other security personnel from sister
agencies,’’ he said. The commandant, however, warned political thugs against destroying
posters and bill boards of other political parties, adding that anybody
caught would be arrested and charged to court. He further advised parents to warn their children who were in the
habit of being in possession of dangerous weapons to desist from doing
so or face the wrath of the law. “I want to use this opportunity to advise parents to warn their wards
against doing anything that will lead to violence before, during and
after the forthcoming elections,” he said. Jibril-Mahmud solicited the support and cooperation of the people of
the state, by reporting suspected miscreants, popularly known as
Yan’daba, to security agents for prompt action. (NAN)
