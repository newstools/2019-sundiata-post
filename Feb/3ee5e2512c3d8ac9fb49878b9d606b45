strategy and other measures to ensure the peaceful conduct of the polls. “The command has increased the number of plain-clothed men in all the divisions across the state to work with the locals. “This measure will enable us gather intelligence reports in order to

cast their votes without fear of anything as measures will be taken to
provide  inductive atmosphere for people to vote candidates of their
choiceth,” he assured.
