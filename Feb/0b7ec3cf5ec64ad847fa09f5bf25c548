By Oluwatope Lawanson Ikeja – Three men:  Rasheed Olowu, 26; Kabiru Ibrahim, 24, and Seyi Asaolu, 26, were on Thursday in Lagos granted a N400,000 bail for allegedly being in possession of guns and belonging to a secret cult. An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court which gave the ruling asked the
defendants to provide two responsible sureties each as part of the bail
conditions. The chief magistrate, Mrs Yewande Aje-Afunwa,  also ruled that the
sureties should show evidence of  three years’ tax to the Lagos State
Government. The defendants: Olowu, 26;  Ibrahim, 24, and Seyi Asaolu, 26, who 
reside in Mile 12 area of  Lagos state, are facing a two-count charge of
being in possession of guns and belonging to an unlawful society. Earlier, the prosecutor, ASP Peter Nwangwu, told the court that the
defendants committed the offences on Dec. 4, 2018 at 5.00 p.m. at
Ajelogo Car Wash in  Mile 12. Nwangwu said the trio were apprehended by some policemen  from Mile 12 Division during a stop-and-search. “The police discovered one cut-to-size locally made pistol with one
live cartridge on one of  the defendants without licence or permission
from the Inspector General of Police. “They could not give a satisfactory explanation on the ownership of the guns in their possession, ” he said. He alleged that the defendants were sometime in 2018  found to belong to an unlawful society called ‘Eiye’ confraternity. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 42 and 330 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 330 provides a two-year jail term for illegal possession of a gun. The case was adjourned until April 18. (NAN)
