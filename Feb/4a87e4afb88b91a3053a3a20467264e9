By Akeem Abas Ibadan – Gov. Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State has urged Nigerians to give INEC the benefit of the doubt by accepting the reasons it gave for postponing Saturday’s election. The Governor’s Special Adviser on Communications and Strategy, Mr
Bolaji Tunji made this known in a statement made available to newsmen in
Ibadan on Saturday. Ajimobi advised against speculations and spreading fake news capable
of igniting crisis in the country, calling for sober reflection among
the players to ensure the sanctity of the electoral process. “Having come this far in the country’s democratic experience, no
sacrifice should be too much for individuals and institutions to pay to
protect the sanctity of democracy as an all-inclusive and best form of
government. “Painful as the last minute decision taken by INEC is, I appeal to
Nigerians to give the commission the benefit of the doubt by accepting
the reasons they have enumerated as valid and genuine. “I have no doubt in my mind that the INEC Chairman has his integrity
at stake and would not dabble into anything that would rubbish his many
years of meritorious service in the public service. “Instead of needless hysteria and blame games, this unfortunate
development should be an opportunity for key players in the election
process to go on sober reflection on how good governance could be
further enshrined in the country,” he said. The governor admonished INEC to ensure that the new dates remained
sacrosanct so that the confidence reposed in them by Nigerians who
believed that they have the best of intention will not be eroded. The governor called on the leaders and followers of the party to remain calm. (NAN)
