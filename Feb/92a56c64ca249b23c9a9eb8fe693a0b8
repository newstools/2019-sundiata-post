By Nick Nicholas Abakaliki – The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps,(NSCDC), Ebonyi command has concluded arrangements to deploy over 1,000 personnel to various voting points in the state to ensure law and order during the forthcoming general elections. Mrs Chinwe Kannu, the NSCDC State Commandant, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abakaliki. She said the personnel would
complement efforts of other security operatives to ensure smooth polls
in the Feb.16 and March 2 elections. She also said that the personnel would be at the polling units and other flash points to avert any possible misunderstanding. The commandant advised the
electorate to conduct themselves maturely at the polling units, get
accredited and cast their votes amicably. “NSCDC personnel will be at all the
13 LGAs, INEC office and the voting points for the purpose of securing
the distribution and delivery of election materials and protection of
election officials. “Half the NSCDC for the elections will be armed to avoid any eventuality at the election ground,” she said. The commandant, who promised that
NSCDC would ensure free, credible and fair general elections in the
state, advised members of the various political parties to tolerate one
another during and after the elections. The NSCDC boss, however, commended
the complementary role of all the security personnel in the state, the
Governor, Dave Umahi and the Federal government for their commitment for
credible elections in the state.
