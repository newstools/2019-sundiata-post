Washington – U.S. President Donald Trump has declared his intention to wind down his country’s 2,000 troops in Syria, but a report issued on Monday warned the extremist group could then make a comeback within six to 12 months. The report by the Inspector-General of the Department of Defence
warned that Islamic State continues to attract dozens of foreign
fighters to Syria and Iraq each month, and maintains a flow of external
donations. Islamic State is “regenerating key functions and capabilities more quickly in Iraq than in Syria.” In both Syria and Iraq, local forces remain heavily reliant on support from the U.S.-led coalition, the report said. While singling out the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as
“tenacious fighters,’’ the Inspector-General noted the threat of a
Turkish invasion against these U.S.-backed forces, as Ankara views them
to be linked to Turkish separatists. The SDF’s war against Islamic State in Syria continues.
Islamic State maintains some 2,000 fighters in eastern Syria where it
has established strong defensive positions and will likely fight on
until the last man. “Challenges to completely defeating ISIS in Iraq include the group’s
rural strength, its tunnels and safe houses, the continued trickle of
foreign fighters, the difficulty in securing the Iraq-Syria border, and
the lack of stability in Sunni areas,” the report said. The report noted, positively that this year’s Shiite pilgrimages were
conducted without major terrorist attacks by Islamic State – an
extremist Sunni group.(dpa/NAN)
