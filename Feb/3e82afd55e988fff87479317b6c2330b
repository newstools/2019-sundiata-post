By Victor Adeoti Osogbo – An election observer group, Youth Initiative for Advocacy, Growth and Advancement (YIAGA Africa) has commended youth candidacy participation in the forthcoming general elections in the country. The Executive Director of YIAGA, Mr
Samson Itodo, in a pre-election in Osogbo on Friday, described the
development as impressive. Itodo said youth candidacy
participation in the Senate and House of Representatives elections had
significantly increased from 10 and 13 per cent in 2015 to 13.5 and 27.4
per cent in 2019. According to the report, in 2019
general elections, 253 young candidates are running for the Senate and
1,262 for the House of Representatives The report also indicated that in
terms of party distribution, youth candidacy for the Senate and House of
Representatives, five political parties had the highest number. The five political parties in the
House of Representatives according to the report are: Democratic
Alternative (85), Peoples Party of Nigeria (80), African Democratic
Congress (72), Peoples Trust (43), and Green Party of Nigeria (43). For the Senate, Democratic
Alternative has 25, Peoples Party of Nigeria, 14, Justice Must Prevail
Party, 11, African Democratic Congress, 11 and Accord, 10. “With this analysis given, the 2019
general elections will be a deciding factor not just for democracy, but
also the inclusion of young people and all genders,” Itodo said. The report, however, decried the downturn in female participation in the coming elections. According to it, female participation declined from 17 and 15 per cent in 2015 to 16 and 13.4 per cent in 2019. Female candidacy in Nigeria has a
long way to go in terms of participation and inclusive opportunities
within the Executive and Legislative arm of government in Nigeria,
according to the report.
