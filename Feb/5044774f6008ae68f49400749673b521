By Yakubu Uba Demsa (Adamawa) – The Adamawa Gubernatorial Candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) Sen. Abdul-Azeez Nyako, says tackling insecurity in the state will be a top priority of his administration if elected. Nyako made the promise on Thursday in Dong village, Demsa Local
Government Area, during his Ward-to-Ward campaign tour of the state. Nyako, who is the serving senator for Adamawa Central, said with his
military background; and having served as youth leader (Sarkin Matasa)
of Adamawa Emirate Council, he would bring these experiences to bear in
tackling the state’s security challenges. He noted that the challenges, which were largely due to drug
addiction, Boko Haram insurgency and poverty in the state, would be
speedily addressed. The senator promised to resuscitate grassroots empowerment programmes to address poverty at the rural areas. “We will empower farmers through extension services at farming skills
demonstration centres and facilitate the supply of farm inputs. “We are also committed to building a modern economic system in the
state through increased productivity, income generation, profitability
and improvement of infrastructure,” Nyako said. Earlier, the ADC Ward Chairman, Mr Meshal Danyaro, lamented the lack
of electricity and decay of infrastructure including schools in the
area. “We have been neglected for long. We do not have portable water, electricity supply, road infrastructure and schools. “Our only school has been destroyed by flood; and the state
government is not making any attempt to reconstruct it,” Danyaro said. He urged the people to vote the ADC candidate, who had taken time to assess the area and proffer possible solutions. (NAN)
