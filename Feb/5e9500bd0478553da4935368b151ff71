By Abiodun Azi Lagos â€“ Mrs Sanuth Omotunde of Accord Party has said that she would ensure that Alimosho Constituency 2 had necessary infrastructure that would enhance the development of the area if elected into the Lagos State House of Assembly. Omotunde made the assertion while speaking in Alimosho during her campaign rally where she reeled out her nine-point agenda. She said that the plank link bridge at Igando/Ayobo axis of the local
government would be upgraded to a standard modern bridge made of
concrete. Omotunde said that Alimosho was a local government in a mega state and having a plank bridge in it was an eyesore. She added that she would also move for a legislation for the building of low cost market facilities. The candidate said that if there was low cost market facilities,
energy would be channelled into productivity and there would be no room
for idleness. She said that she would also move for a welfare bill for the aged and young ones. Omotunde said that part of her nine-point agenda was to advocate for
malls, cinemas, made in Alimosho products and improved economy of the
area. She said that empowerment for youths, mobile health centres and
enthronement of rightly priced taxes, rate and levies would be her
focus.
