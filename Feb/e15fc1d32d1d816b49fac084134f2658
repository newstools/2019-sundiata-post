By Joseph Edeh Abuja – The Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) has denied alleged plan to shut down internet access during the upcoming general elections. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
reports that ONSA is reacting to Gov. Nyesom Wike of Rivers, who alleged
the Federal Government of planning to use the “shut down” to rig
elections. Wike said the FG, through ONSA had
directed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to work
with internet service providers to shut down internet access across the
country during the exercise. But, a statement by the Spokesman to
the National Security Adviser (NSA), Mr Danjuma Reuben, on Friday in
Abuja, advised the general public to disregard the allegation. “This Office, wishes to state that
the internet and associated communications infrastructure are major
components of the Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII),
which ONSA is mandated to ensure its security,” he said. He said that ONSA in collaboration
with relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government (MDA),
had been making efforts to protect and improve service delivery to
Nigerians. He explained that every single national security platform in the country depended on the same internet to function. “Therefore “shutting down” the internet is akin to shutting down national development and security,” he said. He said ONSA remained committed to
protecting the rights of the public to access Information and
Communication Technology facilities. “The Office also remains non-partisan and committed to ensuring that Nigerians freely exercise their civic rights,” he said. NAN reports that the National
Security Adviser (NSA), retired Maj-Gen. Mohammed Monguno, had said
intelligence reports indicated plans by some individuals and groups to
instigate violence during the upcoming elections. (NAN)
