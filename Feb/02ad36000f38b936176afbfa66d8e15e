Lusaka – Zambia’s Finance Minister, Margaret Mwanakatwe,  on Tuesday said the ministry would embark on a clean-up of the payroll system in order to remove ghost workers. Mwanakatwe said the entire payroll system needed to be cleaned up and
ghost workers removed quickly in order to reduce the public service
wage bill. The minister urged the Controller of Internal Audits to work together
with the Accountant General and other relevant institutions in the
clean up as part of government efforts to enhance financial
accountability. “We only need to pay deserving workers,’’ she said in a release from the ministry. She, however, expressed confidence that the effective enforcement of
the law on public finance management will significantly improve this
year and will have a positive impact on resource allocation and
eventually lead to improved public service delivery. In another development, entrepreneurs in China and Zambia should
forge strong partnerships that would result in a win-win situation for
all parties, an industry body said on Tuesday. Forming strong partnerships will go a long way in building capacity
in Zambian enterprises and eventually contribute to the growth of the
southern African nation’s economy. Nelson Musonda, President of the Chililabombwe Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, said local business bodies should lead the way and
encourage their members to participate at business forums, in China in
order to forge strong partnerships. “Increased partnerships with Chinese entrepreneurs as well as
attending the Chinese business expos, is the way to go for Zambian
business groups if they are to build on their capacity to do business,’’
he said. According to him, building strong partnerships with Chinese
enterprises will help Zambian businesses in acquiring technology
transfer and skills development. He added that Zambia was endowed with abundant raw materials that
could be exploited through strong partnerships with Chinese enterprises.
