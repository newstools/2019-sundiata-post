By Abujah Racheal Abuja – The Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace (IDFP), a faith-based NGO, has called on the Federal Government to secure the release of Leah Sharibu from the captivity of Boko Haram terrorists. Bishop Sunday Onuoha,  of Methodist Church, Nigeria, and an Executive
Co- Chair of the NGO, made the call while addressing a press conference
on Tuesday in Abuja. Onuoha appealed to the Federal Government to fulfill its promise of
ensuring that Leah was freed from the custody of her abductors. The cleric explained that the press briefing was called to remind
Nigerians of the importance of peace to the country, and also remind the
government of how important Leah is to the nation. He stressed that the government should not forget that Leah was in captivity because she refused to renounce her faith. He pleaded that Leah should be set free, and should not be allowed to be killed by her captors. Speaking on the forthcoming general elections, he urged Nigerians to
ensure that all hands were on deck to deliver a credible and peaceful
election on Feb. 23. He further called on all concerned, especially the candidates, to
ensure that the country remains peaceful, before, during and after the
polls. He urged security agencies to wear their patriotic toga and be neutral in carrying out their duties. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), recalls that IDFP is a Nigerian
national interfaith and intercultural dialogue forum, established in
January 2017(NAN).
