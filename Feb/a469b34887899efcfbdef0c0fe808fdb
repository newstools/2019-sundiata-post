The Independent and National Electoral Commission (INEC) has clarified that any of the fingers can be used for marking the ballot paper, as long as it doesn’t extend into another column. There are stories making round on the internet that votes are only supposed to be cast exclusively with the index finger, but INEC in a tweet has described this as fake news. “Fake News Alert: Any finger can be used for marking a ballot paper.” INEC tweeted.
