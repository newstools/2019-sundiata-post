By Ismaila Chafe Abuja â€“ President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday hosted All Progressives Congress (APC) members of the House of Representatives and candidates to a presidential dinner at the State House, Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that President Buhari and his guests later went into a closed doors meeting. The dinner was attended by National Chairman of the APC, Comrade
Adams Oshiohmole and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss
Mustapha. Others in attendance were the principal officers of the house
including Deputy Speaker, Yusuf Lasun; the Majority Leader of the House
of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila as well as other APC members. NAN reliably gathered that the meeting would discuss political matters including the forthcoming general elections. The outcome of the closed door meeting was still being awaited as at the time of filing this report. The President had on Jan. 28 hosted APC Senators and candidates to similar dinner at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
