Horrible pictures of NYSC Corps members who are supposed to be adhoc officials for the presidential election sleeping in open fields, buses and unkept environments have emerged on the internet. This has caused a lot of provocation because INEC was supposed to cater for them, their transportation and accommodation. But clearly, the corpers are left to their fate, and a horrible one at that. Nigerians are asking INEC some serious questions on Twitter.
