By Josephine Obute Lagos – The current Miss Nigeria, Chidinma Aaron, on Friday urged Nigerian youths to shun every violence during the forthcoming general elections that would hold across the country. Aaron told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that youths
should not allow themselves to be used to cause any crisis during the
elections. “We must be careful not to engage in any form of violence or
sponsored crisis that can lead to rigging or destruction of materials
during the forthcoming elections. “My advice to youths is that they should exercise their rights by
voting wisely on Feb. 16 and March 2, instead of disrupting the
exercise. “No patriotic youth should sell their votes for any cost; it does not
worth it, the regrets will outweigh the temporary gains,” the beauty
queen said. The queen then urged the youth to stand for what is right, just and peaceful, in the interest of the nation. Aaron said that if youths should be lured into disrupting the
electoral process, they would be destroying their future because they
would be getting there in no distant time. “It is better we hearken to the voice of peace and boast of a better
future than shut our ears to it today and regret such actions tomorrow,”
she said. The queen told the youth that there were many candidates being
presented for the elections by the various political parties and such
candidates have unique manifestoes to choose from. She also advised them to regard the days of the elections as days to
display true patriotism by coming out en masse to cast their votes for
candidates of their choices. “Vote for your chosen candidates, vote  according to your conscience. “Do not plunge our great country backwards by selling your votes, by
engaging in election violence or assisting in any form of violence,” she
said. NAN reports that the 25-year-old queen took over from Mildred Ehiguese, the 41st queen, who won the 2017 edition.
