By Nicholas Dechi Makurdi – A Benue-based businessman, Mr Terlumun Nahanga, said social programmes initiated by the present administration aided the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari in the presidential election. Nahanga stated this on Wednesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Makurdi. He said that Buhari actually won his election the day he thought of
initiating the social programmes, adding that he perceived the victory
of the president long before Feb.23. ”The social programmes have touched most families.A lot of people are recruited under N-Power and School Feeding Programme. ”Also, the money he gave to market people has helped people to enhance their businesses. ”Most people voted for him because his victory is anchored purely on the social programmes, “he said. A journalist,Mr Kenneth Kene, who congratulated Buhari for his
victory at the polls, however, called on him to flush out the “bad eggs“
in his administration.
