By Thompson Yamput Sportsmanship Mangu (Plateau) – As results of Saturday elections trickle in, Mr James Dalok, running mate to Sen.  Jeremiah Useni,  Plateau PDP Governorship Candidate, has appealed to politicians to accept election results. Dalok made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Mangu, Plateau. “Politics is a game of number in which there is always a winner and a
loser; a good politician will be bold enough to accept the outcome of
an election he/she participated in. “After all, there is always another chance to go into another contest, once there is life. “Politics is not a do or die affair but a demonstration of the
people’s wishes as to whom they want to lead them,’’ Dalok told NAN. According to him, voting is decision-making. “Your PVC  – Permanent Voter Card – is the weapon that gives you that power in democracy. “So, if it is the people that decide the fate of a candidate in an
election, I don’t see any reason that candidate should pull down the
heavens for losing. “Let us be bold to accept defeat and congratulate the winner for the growth and development of our society, ’’ he advised. Dalok hailed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for
the  conduct of Saturday’s polls which, he described as a huge success. Mr Emmanuel Lar, Chairman, Kanke Local Government Area of Plateau,
also told NAN that politicians should avoid  all manner of trouble as
election results were being released. Lar said that a peaceful society would progress, adding that  God-fearing and purposeful leaders would ensure a better tomorrow. He thanked INEC and politicians for  peace during electioneering and Saturday’s voting in Plateau. “Security agents’ doggedness at manning the entire polling units
across the state without recording any crisis is worth commendation.’’
he added. According  to the chairman,  democracy has come to stay in Nigeria,
and the citizens should nurtured it well for  the good of the nation.
