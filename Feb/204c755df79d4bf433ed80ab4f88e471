By AbdulFatai Beki Ilorin – Alhaji Wasiu Atitebi, the Federal Controller of Works in Kwara, says the Federal Government is not indebted to any contractor handling all ongoing road projects in the state. Atitebi made the clarification on Tuesday while speaking with the
News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the sidelines of  a tour of  some
Federal Government road projects across the state. The controller  was in company with the Director of Federal Highways for the North Central Zone, Mr Dayyabul Mamnan. Atitebi said the Federal Government was not owing  any contractor for
jobs executed, adding that all certificates for payment of  jobs
executed were settled by the Federal Government. One of the contractors handling the projects, Mr Nie Yong, while
corroborating the claim of the Controller, said the Federal Government
was not owing his company. Atitebi, who inspected the completed llorin-Jebba road, expressed satisfaction with the execution of the project. Some of the motorists plying the llorin-Jebba road expressed
gratitude to the Federal Government over the completion of the road,
saying it would  boost socio-economic development of  the area. They called for creation of alternative roads for trucks to reduce accidents on the newly constructed road. Other ongoing road projects inspected were the Ilorin-Egbe boundary road, Offa bye-pass and the Aboto-Afon boundary road. (NAN)
