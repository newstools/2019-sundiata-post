By Chinyere Joel-Nwokeoma Lagos – The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) profited from a beehive of activities on its trading floor last week with market capitalisation appreciating by N334 billion following bargain hunting, despite political risks. Specifically, the market capitalisation which opened at N11.424
trillion gained N334 billion or 2.92 per cent to close at N11.758
trillion. Also, the All-Share Index rose by 893.56 points or 2.92 per cent to
close at 31,529.92 compared with its 30,636.36 opening figure. Analysts who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) attributed the
growth to positive sentiments ahead of 2018 earnings season and low
interest rates in the United States of America. Prof. Uche Uwaleke, Head of Banking and Finance Department, Nasarawa
State University Keffi, said the growth was due to positive sentiments
regarding expected corporate results. Uwaleke explained that investors were taking position in the stock
market in anticipation of enhanced dividend, especially the banking
stocks. He said the rally, which began three weeks ago, was interrupted by
the Chief Justice of Nigeria saga and heightened political tension. “Last week has been politically uneventful. This week’s performance
will be mixed and will most likely close lower than last week on account
of the polls,” Uwaleke said. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd.,
said foreign investors were taking position in the debt market and the
equities market due to low interest yield in the United States. Omordion said investors were taking advantage of hight interest rate
and yields in the bond market and equities market to offset lower yields
abroad, after US Federal Reserve Bank signaled it would not increase
rates. He added that expected positive earnings reporting season and big
expectations from the banking stocks contributed to the market growth. Analysts at Cordros Capital said foreign and domestic players shunned
the looming election risk as the Nigeria’s equity market returned to a
cheerful mood. They, however, urged investors to trade cautiously amidst uncertainties ahead of the elections. “Looking ahead, we continue to guide investors to trade cautiously
amidst brewing political jitters ahead 2019 elections, and the absence
of a positive market trigger. “However, we believe positive macroeconomic fundamentals will drive recovery post-election,” they said. NAN reports that breakdown of the price movement chart showed that
