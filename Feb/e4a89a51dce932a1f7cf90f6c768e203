By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Supreme Court, on Friday affirmed the
decision of the High Court in Rivers State that the All Progressives Congress
(APC) in the state is not eligible to field candidate in the forthcoming 2019
election in the state. Sundiata Post recalls that the High Court sitting in Rivers had earlier
annulled the candidature of all the candidates of the Rivers APC. However, the Court of Appeal last week
ruled that the Rivers APC could present candidates, overruling the judgment of
the High Court. Therefore it will be no show for the
Rivers APC in the February and March elections after the apex court’s judgement
sustained the judgement of the High Court. This decision by the Supreme Court means
the Rivers State APC will not present candidates in the February 16 National
Assembly election and the Governorship and House of Assembly elections on March
2. Recall that the state chapter of the party could not resolve
their crisis which led to the conduct of two separate primaries in utter
disregard of the order of the court. Details later….
