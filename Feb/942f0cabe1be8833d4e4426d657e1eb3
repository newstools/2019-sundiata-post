Buhari, as I showed yesterday, is himself an active rigger. But what is particularly disturbing about his instruction to security forces to extra-judicially murder so-called ballot snatchers is that Buhari suffers from a mental disorder that leads him to think that any vote against him is rigging. Here’s my evidence. When he ran for president in 2003, 2007, and 2011, Buhari never campaigned in the South. In fact, he didn’t even campaign in the Christian North. Yet he believed he “won” the elections and was “rigged out” by PDP. The only time Buhari’s presidential campaign extended beyond the Muslim North was in 2015. Yet, even though incontrovertible evidence now shows that his victory was possibly aided by rigging in spite of the significantly more national appeal of his candidature in 2015, Buhari believes that the 2015 election in which he emerged victorious was the only free and fair election in Nigeria. That, right there, is the picture of the mind of a man held hostage by a psychic disorder. Since Nigerian security forces are now explicitly biased in his favor, as these photos illustrate, a vote against him might be interpreted as “rigging” or “ballot box snatching” and be met with deadly force. This empty-headed, violent old thug called Buhari will ignite a national inferno if he’s not stopped in his tracks. Source: Facebook
