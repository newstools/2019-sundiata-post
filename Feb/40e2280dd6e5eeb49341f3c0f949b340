Berlin – U.S. Ambassadors in Germany, Denmark and the EU have called on Germany’s EU partners to support legislative proposals that would regulate the German-Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream 2. “Nord Stream 2 would further increase Europe’s vulnerability to
Russian blackmail in the energy sector,’’ Richard Grenell in Berlin. His counterparts Carla Sands and Gordon Sondland wrote in a guest article in German for Deutsche Welle. The fact that the EU depends on Russian gas carries risks for Europe and the West as a whole, they wrote. “Nord Stream 2 will deliver more than just Russian gas. Russia’s
power and influence will spread through the Baltic Sea to Europe,’’ the
article said. The pipeline will allow Moscow to further undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and stability, it added. In addition, Europe’s billions could finance fake news factories
targeting democratic institutions in Europe and the United States, the
ambassadors wrote. In the EU, a revision of the so-called Gas Directive will be voted on Friday. It would allow the European Commission to regulate at least parts of the long-distance gas pipeline already under construction. Nord Stream 2 would then have to meet new conditions that could reduce profits and possibly make the project uneconomic. For example, it is envisaged that a gas supplier may not simultaneously be the operator of a pipeline. The success of the regulatory plans was previously considered
unlikely, but according to information from German daily Sueddeutsche
Zeitung, France could now side with its supporters, thereby decisively
changing the prospects for its success.
