By Zubairu Idris Katsina – The Katsina State Police Command has pledged to maintain neutrality and provide adequate security during the upcoming general elections. The State’s Commissioner of Police,
Mr Mohammed Wakili, disclosed this on Wednesday in Katsina during a
pre-election parley, organised by an (NGO), Anchor Initiative for
Community Development (AICD) in collaboration with Katsina branch of
Nigerian Bar Association (NBA). Wakili was represented by Mr Musa Yusufari, Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) in Charge of Administration in the command. ‘‘The Police are well prepared for
the elections; we will collaborate with other security agents to provide
security and the police will be neutral,’’ he said. Wakili said that a peace accord had
been signed by all the governorship candidates, underscoring their
resolve for hitch free elections in the state. He, therefore, solicited for the
support and constructive criticisms from the public to enable security
agencies discharge their constitutional responsibilities. The NBA Social Secretary, Mr Paul
Gbande, stated that the Electoral Act had spelt out certain actions
regarded as misconducts during the elections. He said: ‘‘On the date in which an
election is held, doing any of the following acts in a polling unit or
within a distance of 300 metres of the polling unit, is regarded as
misconduct. ‘‘Canvass for votes, solicit for
vote of any voter, persuade a voter not to vote for any particular
candidate, persuade any voter not to vote at the election and shout
slogan concerning the election. ‘‘Others were being in possession of
any offensive weapon or wear any dress or harm any official, use any
vehicle wearing the symbol of political party, snatch or destroy any
election material.” In his remarks, the AICD Chairman,
Babadiya Shola, said that the parley was aimed at sensitising various
stakeholders to their rights, responsibilities, scope and limitations as
provided in the constitution. (NAN)
