HAbuja
(Sundiata Post) –  Movement for the
Actualisation of the Sovereign States of Biafra (MASSOB), has attributed the
Vice President, Yomi Osinbajo’s helicopter crash to the grand design by the
North to replace him with one of their own ahead of the presidential election. Leader of the
group Uchenna Madu, who disclosed this in Owerri, further warned the VP to be
very careful about northern agenda. Madu further
claimed that God has just given the vice president the last chance to speak up
on injustice being done to Christians in the country. According to Madu “this is the last chance given to the vice
president by God; he cannot continue to keep quiet and watch various atrocities
being meted to Christians; God knows why he has saved his life. “He cannot continue to watch while other zones
perish in the hands of one zone; the vice president is a Christian and a
pastor; he knows the implication of keeping quiet on matters like this; so he
should be very careful.” Madu said: “In
2015, the northerners could not completely have their way because Tinubu was
there; now if Osinbajo is not careful, the northerners will have their way to
prepare the country for an Islamic state.” Source: The Sun
