By Suleiman Shehu Ibadan – The Oyo State Police Command said it had arrested a syndicate that specializes in defrauding unsuspecting victims seeking money rituals. The State Commissioner of Police, Olukolu Shina, disclosed this on
Monday while parading some suspects at the Command Headquarters,
Eleyele, Ibadan. The police commissioner said that three members of the syndicate were
arrested after defrauding a banker (name withheld) who works at a new
generation bank in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State. “The victim, having been hypnotized, was defrauded of a huge sum of
money, both in local and foreign currencies to the tune of over N16
million by the fraudsters who promised to double the money for him. “The victim, out of desperation, believed the suspect and
fraudulently obtained the sum of USD 20,000 from Treasure Harmony Bureau
De Change in Ibadan through his wife and thereafter went underground. “The victim, who is a bank, cashier, also secretly stole some hard
currencies from the vault of the bank in his quest to get rich quickly,”
the CP said. He said discrete investigation conducted by the operatives of the
command following the report of the incident led to the arrest of the
three members of the fraudulent syndicate at their hideout in Osogbo. The CP said the suspects would be charged to court as soon as investigation was concluded. Shina warned politicians and their supporters against intimidation
and thuggery during the upcoming elections, saying the command would
henceforth clampdown on agents of destabilization. (NAN)
