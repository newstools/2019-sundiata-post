Following the incident at the APC rally in Ogun state today where dignitaries on the stage, including president Muhammadu Buhari were booed and stoned, opposition member, Femi Fani-Kayode has reacted by saying that the treatment meted on the president was one he deserved. “First you were booed and jeered and now you are being stoned at your own party rally! Shame on you Buhari! The Lord is paying you back for your cruelty to Nigerians over the last 3 years! God’s judgement is upon you for your evil and wicked ways and this is just the beginning!” He tweeted.
