  By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu, – The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), on Sunday, appealed to politicians to desist from politics of bloodshed to enhance growth and inclusiveness of the democratic process. NANS’ National Public Relations Officer (PRO), Comrade Bestman
Okereafor, made the appeal in a statement issued to the News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu. NAN recalls that two persons were allegedly killed and 13 vehicles
were damaged in pre-election violence that erupted in Obot-Akara Local
Government Area of Akwa Ibom on Friday, Feb. 15. Also, the Kaduna State Government had in a statement on Friday
evening, confirmed that 66 persons were killed by unidentified gunmen in
Kajuru local government of the state on Feb. 15. Okereafor said: “No life is worth shedding for political scores. “As intellectuals, we have no doubt that the decision for
postponement would have been reached based on life saving information at
the disposal of INEC and not necessarily based on logistics challenges
alone, as disclosed by INEC. “We believe the issue of security would also have influenced the postponement of the elections. “Thus, considering the violence recorded on Feb.15, the eve of the election, it is enough reason for postponement,’’ he said. The NANS official prayed for repose of the souls of the dead and for God to grant their families the fortitude to bear the loss. “NANS is praying to God to grant the families and loved ones of the
dead the fortitude to bear the loss and for repose of the souls of the
departed,’’ he said.
