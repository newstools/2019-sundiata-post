funds flow to the three systems of government from what is termed the
FEDERATION ACCOUNT. The Federation Account serves as the central pocket through which the
Governments – Federal, States, and Local Governments – fund
developmental projects as well as maintain their respective workforce. The flow of revenue into the Federation Account includes oil revenues
and related taxes, revenues generated from the NCS trade facilitation
activities, company income tax (CIT), any sale of national assets,
surplus and dividends from States Owned Enterprises. Fundamentally, there are two components of the revenue allocation
formula used for the disbursement of the Federation Account to the three
tiers of government. These are Vertical Allocation Formula and Horizontal Allocation Formula.
