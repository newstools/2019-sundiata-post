By Christian Ogbonna Yenagoa – Ahead of the Feb. 16 and March 2 general elections, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) MacJim Foundation, has organised a town hall meeting to discourage electoral violence, vote buying and selling in Bayelsa. The Executive Director of the organisation, Mr Godson Jim-Dorgu, said
during the meeting in Yenagoa that it was organised in collaboration
with the Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room. “We are using the programme to educate the electorate on the need to desist from violence. “We are trying to encourage peaceful elections. We know that from
1999 till date, Bayelsa has experienced some level of violence and
conflicts during elections. “We felt it was high time we engaged not only the electorate but the
communities to tell them what their rights and roles are and how they
can come together to mitigate electoral violence. “The aspect of vote buying is a major menace in our society. There is
need for the electorate to know the rules, regulations and the
electoral law,” he stated. (NAN)
