Istanbul – Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met Jared Kushner in Ankara on Wednesday with the talks focused on the White House adviser’s Middle East peace plan. Also present at the meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump’s
son-in-law was Berat Albayrak, Turkey’s finance minister and Erdogan’s
son-in-law. It lasted two hours, according to state news agency Anadolu. No further details were available. Erdogan is a strident critic of Israel and the Trump administration’s policies in the region. He has frequently said Israel’s actions against Palestinians are similar to methods used by the Nazis. Kushner arrived in Ankara after stops in Bahrain and the United Arab
Emirates to discuss his Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative. In a recent interview with Sky News Arabia, Kushner said details of
his proposed initiative would be revealed after Israel’s elections in
April. He is due to visit Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where he could meet
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. Palestinians hope East Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in the
1967 Six-Day War, will be the capital of their future state. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital. Trump has said he wants to conclude an Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement by the end of his first term and Kushner was tasked with
preparing it. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said the Trump administration
disqualified itself as a peace negotiator after upending decades of
U.S. policy by recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the
U.S. embassy there.
