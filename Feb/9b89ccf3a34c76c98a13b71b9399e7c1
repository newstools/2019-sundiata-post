By Peter Amine Jos –  Plateau governor Simon Lalong says he will organise a thanksgiving party for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), in their ancestral homes, when they fully return. Lalong stated this on Wednesday in Jos, at the flag-off of the
distribution of building materials procured by the state government, for
the returning IDPs. The
governor said that his administration was deeply concerned that the
people were forced out of their homes and was ready to assist them to
return home. “God
will not allow us to continue to keep our people in IDPs camps. Some
have since returned home while others are still returning. When all of
them are back, we will hold a thanksgiving there,” he said. The governor stated that the building materials were to aid the people to reconstruct their homes. “The Federal Government is working towards resettling the people, but the state cannot continue to wait while they suffer,” he said. Mr Francis Chong, Chairman of
IDPs in the state, in his remarks, said that 180 bundles of zinc, 80
bags of three inches nails and 80 bags of four inches nails had been
received. Also delivered to the IDPs, he said, are 150 bags of cement, 500 bags of zinc nails, 600 pieces of 2×3 wood, among others. Chong said that the materials would be shared among four communities of Buku, Ngwar, Tissan and Kura Berom. (NAN)
