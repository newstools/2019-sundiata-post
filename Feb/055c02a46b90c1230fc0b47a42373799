By Habibu Harisu Sokoto – Mr Philip Enaberue, the Sokoto State Coordinator of the  National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) says 5, 500 corps members will serve as ad hoc staff in the Saturday election in the  state. Enaberue made this disclosure to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Sokoto. He said the Director-General of the NYSC, Maj.-Gen. Suleiman Kazaure,
had sent a delegation from the NYSC headquarters to interact with the
corps members in readiness for any election challenges. Enaberue reaffirmed the commitment of the NYSC management to continue
to encourage the youth corps members to exhibit good conduct at all
times. He quoted the director -general as advising corps members to resist
the temptation to compromise the guidelines of the elections, by 
remaining neutral and apolitical in the course of  discharging their
duties. Enaberue said the DG  urged corps members, who are participating in
the 2019 elections to ensure due diligence and transparency in their
conduct. According to him, any member, who violates the rules or flouts the rules of engagement will face the full wrath of the law. He warned that the image of the scheme must not be brought to disrepute in the course of this assignment. Enaberue enjoined corps members to remain neutral in the discharge of their responsibilities. He reassured the corps members of adequate security during the
elections, as relevant stakeholders, including security operatives had
planned to ensure smooth conduct of the exercise. The NYSC coordinator lauded INEC, security agencies and other
stakeholders on their cordial working relationships with the NYSC and
called for its sustainability. Enaberue said the corps members had so far recorded tremendous
achievements in the past election duties, which had earned NYSC a
deserved recognition.
