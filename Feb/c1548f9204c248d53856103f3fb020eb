By Kadiri Abduorahman Abuja – Mrs Julie Okah-Donli, Director-General, National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), has lauded the collaborative efforts of officers of the Nigeria Immigration Service in rescuing victims of trafficking. Okah-Donli gave the commendation while reacting to the recent
conviction of 29 years old Sekinat Owolabi by a Federal High Court in
Osogbo, Osun, for human trafficking. The NAPTIP director-general commended the
immigration officers for rescuing the 19-year-old victim and handed her
over to the agency, a step which led to the arrest of the convict. ”This kind of collaboration among law enforcement agencies is what is needed in combating human trafficking in Nigeria. ”Our prosecutors will do their utmost best to successfully prosecute human traffickers and cases handed over to us,” she said. Similarly, Okah-Donli had recently raised an alarm that no fewer than
20,000 Nigerian girls trafficked to Mali, were under sexually
exploitative conditions. She then called on concerned arms of government and the international
community to help in working out modalities toward the successful
rescue and effective rehabilitation of the girls. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Owolabi was sentenced to four years imprisonment without option of fine. According to a statement by Nneka Aniagoh of NAPTIP’s Press and
Public Relations Unit, the convict was tried and convicted by the
Federal High Court, Osogbo. Aniagoh said the convict was arrested for organising the foreign
travel of the victim (names withheld) to Mali for exploitative
prostitution. ”This contravenes Sections 15 (a), 16 and 19 (b) of the Trafficking
in Persons (Prohibition) Law Enforcement and Administration Act, 2003
(as amended in 2005). ”The victim, who was rescued by the Nigeria Immigration Services and
handed over to NAPTIP, aided the agency in the subsequent arrest of the
convict,” she said.
