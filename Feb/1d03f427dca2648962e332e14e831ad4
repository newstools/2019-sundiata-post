Seoul – Hyundai Mobis Co. Ltd, an auto parts affiliate of Hyundai Motor Co, on Tuesday announced a plan to offer shareholder returns worth 2.6 trillion won (2.32 billion dollars) over the next three years. It also announced plans to appoint group heir apparent Euisun Chung as chief executive. The plan comes after Chung early in January pledged to complete a
restructuring of South Korea’s second-biggest conglomerate, which is
widely expected to pave the way for him to formally succeed his
octogenarian father as head of the group. Last year, the group’s plan to overhaul its ownership structure was
shelved following opposition from U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management
Corp. The plan by Hyundai Mobis includes dividends worth 1.1 trillion won, a
buyback of stocks worth 1 trillion won and a cancellation of 460
billion won worth of shares. The parts supplier also said it would appoint Opel former Chief Executive Karl-Thomas Neumann as an outside board director.
