United Nations – A senior UN counter-terrorism official on Monday warned against complacency over the defeat of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group. “In spite of recent successes against the IS and its affiliates, the
threat posed by returning and relocating fighters, as well as from
individuals inspired by them, remains high and has a global reach,’’
Vladimir Voronkov, Under-Secretary-General of UN Counter-Terrorism
Office, told the Security Council. “I would therefore emphasise that the recent ISIL losses should not
lead to complacency at any level,’’ Voronkov said, using the initials of
another name for the group: the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, briefing the Security Council on a
report of UN on the threat posed by the IS to international peace and
security, said Voronkov called for a well-coordinated multilateral
response to address the challenge. “The threat of terrorism is a global challenge. “It has grown in magnitude and impact over the last several decades. “It does not recognise any geographical or perceived borders. “Given the complexity, it is only through a well-coordinated
multilateral response that we can address this challenge,’’ Guterres
noted. (Xinhua/NAN)
