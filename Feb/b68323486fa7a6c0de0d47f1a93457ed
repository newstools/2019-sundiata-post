By Hajara Leman Gombe – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is to hire donkeys and bicycles to distribute election materials in hard-to-reach areas of Gombe State. Alhaji Umar Ibrahim, Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the
state, made this known in an interview with newsmen in Gombe on Friday. Ibrahim said the difficult terrains were villages located in Yamaltu-Deba and Shingom Local Government Areas of the state. “We will hire donkeys, bicycles and motorcycles to distribute election materials. “This is because some of the areas lack access routes and INEC has
made adequate arrangements in the area of logistics as well as other
areas,’’ he said. Ibrahim said the commission had made adequate arrangements in terms of security and conducted massive voter education. He noted that there was provision for brail ballot papers for the blind and the lepers could use their legs to vote.
