The way appears to have been cleared for the participation of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State in the forthcoming General Elections. This follows the dismissal by the Court of Appeal, Sokoto Division, of the appeal challenging the qualification of candidates put forward by the APC for various offices in the state. A three-member panel led by Justice Jummai Sankey unanimously dismissed the appeal following its withdrawal by the appellant, Aminu Jaji, an APC governorship candidate in the state. The court held that Jaji was at liberty to withdraw the case based on Order 11, Rule 1, of the Appeal Court laws which permits an appellant to do so after serving a notice on the parties and filing same with the registrar, at any time before the appeal is called for hearing. Mr Jaji had in the appeal challenged the judgment of a Zamfara State High Court asking the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to recognise the candidates of the APC for various offices in the State. INEC had earlier said it would not recognize the candidates who were produced after the time stipulated for primaries. Also following conflicting judgments on the matter by a Zamfara High Court and a Federal High Court in Abuja, INEC insisted that it would not change its position on the matter. However, with this judgement, the APC will now participate in all elections in the state.
