President Muhammadu Buhari has said that nothing would make Nigeria to jettison the choice of democratic governance which it has embraced. The President said this during a television and radio broadcast to the nation on Friday (today). Noting the national concerns that had attended the rescheduling of the 2019 general elections, the President encouraged Nigerians to go out and vote, saying, “democratic governance is a wise and fitting system.” The President said, “Democracy, being the best form of government, has its own challenges, and we need to be patient to see the exercise ahead through. “Tomorrow, the polls open. Tomorrow, we affirm that Nigeria stands as a democracy and that no worldly hand can deter us from this wise and fitting path we have chosen for ourselves.”
