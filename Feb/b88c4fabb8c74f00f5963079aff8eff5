By Sandra Umeh Lagos – A former president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Mr Olisa Agbakoba (SAN) has approached a Federal High Court in Lagos, challenging the suspension of Justice Walter Onnoghen as Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN). In the suit, Agbakoba joined the Attorney General of the Federation
(AGF) and the National Judicial Council (NJC) as first and second
defendants. His application is brought pursuant to Order 3 rule 9 of the Federal High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2009. The plaintiff wants the court to decide, whether by the combined
interpretation of Section 153 (1)(i) and Section 292 (1) (a) (i) of the
Constitution, Justice Onnoghen can be suspended from office without the
recommendation of the NJC or the President acting on an address
supported by two third majority of the Senate. Agbakoba seeks from the court: “A Declaration that by the combined
interpretation of the above Sections of the Constitution as (amended)
Justice Onnoghen cannot be suspended or removed from office except on
the recommendation of the NJC or the President acting on an address
supported by two thirds majority of the Senate.” He also seeks further order or orders as the Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances. No date has been fixed for hearing of the suit. (NAN)
