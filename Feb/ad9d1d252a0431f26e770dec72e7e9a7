Former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri has warned that President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory will lead to a fall of Nigerian Stock Exchange. INEC had earlier announced Buhari winner of the Saturday’s presidential election. Against this backdrop, some Nigerians who took to his Twitter handle and mocked him. Reacting, Omokri reminded them that the Nigerian Stock Exchange lost N85bn just yesterday. In a series of tweets, he stressed that Buhari’s victory may lead to investors leaving Nigeria. He wrote: “In 2015 when @MBuhari won, the Nigerian Stock Exchange gained almost ₦100 billion. “After 4 years, investors now know Buhari. He looks set to win this rigged election and the Stock Market lost ₦85 billion today. So stop asking me how market. Ask yourself that question instead. “Dear @Surajudeenadio: Just today alone, the Nigerian Stock Exchange lost ₦85 billion ‘celebrating’ your #NextLevel. Wait until tomorrow, those who were ‘sleeping’ will celebrate by taking their investment elsewhere. You seem not to understand the true state of Nigeria right now!”
