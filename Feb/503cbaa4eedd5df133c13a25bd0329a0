By Ibukun Emiola Ibadan – Dr Abbas Abdus-Salam, a Radiation Oncologist at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, says  early detection and treatment of cancer remain  the best opportunity for survival. Abdus-Salam stated this in an interview with the News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan on Monday on the sidelines of activities  to
mark the 2019 World Cancer Day. “We need to emphasise that the best opportunity to survive cancer is
to detect it early; so we need to pay attention to our body system,’’ he
said. According to him, Nigerians must watch out for any changes in the
body or long standing wound or blood  coming out from the orifices and
from the virginal or anus. “ May be somebody is coughing out blood or there is a swelling
somewhere in the body,  the breast or any part of the body, these are
some of the things people need to pay attention to and should seek
medical help as soon as possible,’’ he said. The oncologist, who  further said the number of people who have
cancer are increasing, identified the commonest cancer in Nigeria as
breast cancer and cervical cancer common in women. Abdus-Salam said  government needed to do more on cancer treatment. “ We still need to do more on cancer treatment centres and we need
government to subsidise cancer treatment for sufferers although things
are getting better,’’ he said. “For example, a new equipment has been installed in Lagos and Abuja
teaching hospitals while another is currently being installed in Ibadan
here at the University College Hospital,” he said. (NAN)
