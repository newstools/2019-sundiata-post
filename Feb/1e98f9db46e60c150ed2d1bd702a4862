By Nabilu Balarabe Guri (Jigawa) – The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in Jigawa on Saturday donated relief materials to the victims of 2018 flood disasters in Guri Local Government Area of the state. The materials included 10 bags of maize, 15 bags of Guinea Corn, 20
rolls of fabric, nine bundles of mats and over 300 pieces of buckets,
bowls and plates. Alhaji Abdu Magama, the state chairman, National Union of Road
Transport Workers, while presenting the materials in Guri on behalf of
NLC, urged the council to be fair in distributing same to victims of the
disasters “The essence of this donation is just to show our concern, but not to
meet the demands of all the affected persons; we do not have that
capacity. “Therefore, I am appealing to you to show justice and fairness in distributing these materials,” he said. Responding, the Administrative Officer of Guri Council, Alhaji Garba
Isa, thanked the NLC for the gesture and assured that only the affected
persons would benefit from it. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the 2018 flood claimed 21 lives and ravaged over 200 communities in the state. The state NLC Chairman, Alhaji Usman Ya’u, had on Jan. 25, flagged
off  the distribution of N10 million worth of relief materials to
victims of flood disasters across the state. He said the funds were raised from N200 contributions by his members
to assist the victims, many of whom were still leaving in misery, months
after the disaster. He said the NLC and its affiliates had earlier embarked on assessment
tour of 13 Local Government areas worst hit by the flooding, adding
that the materials would be presented to authorities for onward
