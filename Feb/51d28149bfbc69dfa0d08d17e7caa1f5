By Tukur Muntari Kano – A non-governmental organisation , Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD),  has advocated the biometric data capturing of all Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the Northeast as part of measures to ascertain their exact number. CITAD’s Executive Secretary, Yunusa Zakari-Yau, who made the call on
behalf of the Organisation, also called for a similar exercise for those
involved in the management of the IDPs, as well as military personnel
deployed on military operations in the region. Zakari-Ya’u was speaking on the issue with newsmen in Kano on Saturday. He said the call was necessary to check the alleged corrupt practices
being perpetrated by the people involved in the management of the IDPs. “Government should ensure that the military has accurate and
comprehensive data of deployment of its troops in the Northeast region. “There is need for more investigations on the extent of allegations
at which the insurgents are said to be benefitting either from the
diversion of aid or as safe havens for their families. “This must be done with caution, especially the safety of their
families, in order not to make IDPs camps target of Boko Haram’s
reprisal. “The women and children of the insurgents equally have the right to
safe camps, based on UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displaced entire,
“he said. According to him, civil society organisations (CSOs) must also get
involved in fighting corruption, and be given more access to information
for oversight in IDPs camps and the schools being attended by children
of the displaced. He sstressed the need for the Federal Government to ensure clear
 frame work of action on IDPs management to eliminate duplicity and
ambiguity of roles in the running of IDPs camps.
