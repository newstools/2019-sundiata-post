Awka – Mr Godwin Ezeemo, a front-line politician in Anambra has urged the electorate in the state not to engage in vote buying, selling and any other form of electoral malpractice. Ezeem, who is also a PDP Chieftain in the state, made the call on Friday  during a press chat in Awka . He urged the electorate to shun selling their voter’s cards or compromising their conscience in place of material things. “Your voter’s card is not a marketable commodity, use it to vote out
or vote in credible leaders who would make better policies for the
generality of the people. “Remember when you trade your voter’s card, you are voiceless and the
leaders would not give account of their stewardship to you, so be wise
and think well,” he said. Ezeemo said that the voter’s card of the citizenry remained the only
tool they would use to elect credible and God-fearing leaders. He warned them against mortgaging their conscience during the Saturday Presidential/National assembly elections. The onetime governorship aspirant in Anambra, said that democracy was
the best form of government and urged the electorate to join hands in
consolidating the existing democracy. He commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for
its efforts so far in ensuring that the rescheduled elections were
held. He said that INEC must give Nigerians credible elections and reminded
the electoral umpire that the international community was watching its
activities and as such must live up to expectations of Nigerians as
witnessed in 2015 general elections. “This election must come out to reflect the wishes of the people of
Nigeria, INEC must not compromise the peace and unity of the nation,”
Ezeemo said. He appealed to parents especially mothers to admonish their children
not to fall prey to selfish politicians, advising that the children
shall engage in things that would promote peace and unity of the nation.
