By Stephen Adeleye Lokoja – The Kogi government, in collaboration with the National Teachers Institute (NTI), on Monday started a training on effective classroom management for more than 100 teachers. According to Mrs. Rosemary Osikoya, the Kogi Commissioner for
Education, Science and Technology, the three-day training holding in
Lokoja, is aimed at building teachers’ capacity to improve the teaching
and learning atmosphere. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that a similar training was
organised for 100 teachers in 2018, under the theme, ‘Train the
Trainer.’ Osikoya urged the 2019 participants to utilise the opportunity to
improve their skills, urging them to upgrade their knowledge regularly. She said that the allocation for education in the Kogi budget over
the years had not provided funds for teachers’ capacity building, and
commended Gov. Yahaya Bello for making teachers training a priority. She revealed that adequate provision had been made by the governor in the 2019 budget, to build teachers’ capacity. The commissioner said that head teachers, principals and heads of schools and institution would be trained from Feb. 6 to 8. Mrs. Mercy Thankgod, Centre Manager, NTI, who spoke on behalf of the
Director-General of the institute, Prof. Garba Azare, said that the
training was under the aegis of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), project. She said that the training would also enhance participant’s knowledge
in language communication skills, teaching methods and techniques,
effective management skills, as well as Information and Communication
Technology (ICT). One of the participants, Attah Abel, told NAN that the training was a
good initiative that would upgrade the knowledge of both the teachers
and students.
