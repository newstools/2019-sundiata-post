By Victor Okoye Abuja – Nigeria’s Rachael Danjuma, compatriot Amina Wilfred and Eva Mangala of Uganda were the best three players at the end of Day One of the 21st IBB Ladies Golf Championship in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that 2017 IBB Ladies Open
Golf champion Rachael Danjuma was the best gross player of the day after
returning a gross of 81. She was closely followed by Uganda’s Magala who returned a gross of 82. NAN also reports that Magala is the defending champion of the Nigeria
Ladies Open, which she won at the Ibom Hotels and Golf Resort in Uyo in
November 2018. She also doubles as the Lady President of the Uganda Ladies Golf Union. 2015 IBB Ladies Open Amateur Golf champion Wilfred returned a gross of 84 to finish third. Danjuma later told NAN after Day One proceedings on Friday that she was impressed with the turn of events. “The course was quite difficult and challenging today, but I am glad I finished top of the bunch at the end. “I’m delighted that I managed to execute my long drives perfectly. “I had to ensure that I gave a good account of myself on the first
day. This will give me a good psychological boost to reclaim my title
which I lost last year,” she said. Danjuma lost her title to Tanzania’s top female golfer Angel Eaton in
2018 after amassing a total of 228 gross total strokes in the 54-hole
tournament. “My immediate goal now is to pace myself and take it one step at a
time to ensure that I make the cut tomorrow (Saturday),” Danjuma added. No fewer than 160 amateur lady golfers from seven countries, namely
Sweden, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Botswana, Ghana and hosts Nigeria, are
battling it out for top honours at the championship. The three-day gross tournament which teed off at the IBB
International Golf and Country Club on Friday will see 45 lady golfers
make the cut on Saturday. The best 45 will then proceed to Sunday’s final.
