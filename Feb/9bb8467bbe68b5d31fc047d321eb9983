By Segun Giwa Akure – Mrs Oluwatoyin Odeku, Leader of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Elimination of Drug Abuse (PACEDA), South-West, said 22.4 per cent of drug abuse cases in Nigeria happened in the South-west. Odeku disclosed this at a press conference in Akure, Ondo State on Friday. She said the figure was inline with the official statistics released
by the UN in its fact finding mission in the region to curb drug abuse
in the country. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that President Muhammadu
Buhari had on Dec. 10, 2018 inaugurated the committee chaired by
Maj.-Gen. Buba Marwa (Rtd). Odeku said that similar programme has been carried out simultaneously
in all the geopolitical zones of the country, adding that drug abuse
had become a menace that must be curbed. “This calls for urgent action. It cannot be a federal government
fight alone; we must take it to the local government level and to our
religious stakeholders. “It is not something we can joke with, drug abuse is always leading
to crime. We call on all stakeholders to cooperate with us to tackle it. “Drug abuse, in most cases, usually start with curiosity, peer pressure and other unidentified reasons. “Buhari have the best interest of youths in mind, the ministerial
committee was first inaugurated before the presidential advisory
committee to deal with the menace,” she said. Odeku, also advised the Ondo State government to create more
rehabilitation centres for those willing to quit drugs and get
rehabilitated. She called on religious leaders to join hands in the fight against
drug abuse and in helping to create rehabilitation centres. (NAN)
