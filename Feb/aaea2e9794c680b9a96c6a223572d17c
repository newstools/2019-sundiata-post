(Sundiata Post) – The Chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof
Yakubu Mahmud has given reasons why the Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC) postponed the election by one week. Prof Mahmud
said that the postponement by one week was arrived at after consultations with
its technical department which confirmed that 
the card reader which has been configured to work only  today (Saturday) will take five days to be
reconfigured. He said that based on this the commission arrived at one week. He disclosed
this at the World Press briefing at the International Conference Centre in
Abuja which also serves as the collation Centre for the elections. The
commission chairman also informed that the postponement of the presidential and
National Assembly elections was to prevent staggered election. Prof Mahmud said
had the election been allowed to continue, it would no longer be a general
election but would have amounted to staggered election which will not occur
well for the country and the process. The INEC chairman,
who took responsibility on behalf of the commission for the postponed election,
rolled out some issues that led to the decision by the commission. According to
him, delay in delivering ballot sheets and electoral materials to some areas occasioned
by bad weather which hindered the supply of materials as well as destruction of
Permanent Voters Card (PVC), and burning its offices and cubicles accounted for
part of the reason for the postponement. He assured
Nigerians and the foreign observers that the postponement has no political
undertone or due to security situation in the country. However,
Prof Mahmud Yakubu also assured that sensitive materials will be recovered and
return to the Central Bank of Nigeria, (CBN). He therefore
appalled to Nigerians for understanding, adding that the decision to postpone
the election was a painful one for INEC but was necessary in view of the
circumstance. Details
