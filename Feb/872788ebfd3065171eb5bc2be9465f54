By Philomina Attah Abuja – Less than 10 days to the presidential election, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) has pledged to support the candidature of President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as its consensus candidate. In a statement in Abuja on Thursday, it said the decision was part of the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the party. The statement, signed by the party’s Director of Media and Publicity,
Yemi Akinbode, said the party also suspended its National Publicity
Secretary, Alfa Muhammad. “The National Executive Council (NEC) of the Social Democratic Party
(SDP) has resolved to adopt President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice
President Yemi Osinbajo of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as
candidates of our party for the 2019 presidential election. “Members of the SDP are enjoined to vote for President Buhari at the presidential level only, ” he said. Akinbode said that the party was not going into merger with the APC
but explained the party’s decision was due to its inability to present a
candidate. This, he explained, was due to a “lingering legal battle” between
Donald Duke, the winner of the SDP presidential primaries and his major
challenger, Prof. Jerry Gana. “We, therefore, feel that it is imperative to technically withdraw
from the presidential election and focus on the National Assembly,
governorship and state assembly elections, for which we have fielded
candidates across the country.” The party also suspended its National Publicity Secretary, Muhammad,
for allegedly breaching its constitution by indulging in anti-party
activities. (NAN)
