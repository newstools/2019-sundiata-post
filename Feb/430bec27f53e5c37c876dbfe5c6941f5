The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has debunked reports that the body was planning to postpone Saturday’s elections. Presidential and National Assembly elections are scheduled to hold in few hours. National Commissioner for Voter Education and Publicity at INEC, Mr. Festus Okoye, told DAILY POST Friday night that Nigerians should ignore the rumours. His words: “If stories are flying about, allow the stories to fly. What they are reporting is not true.” Asked to respond to information that INEC commissioners were in a meeting, Okoye said: “Yes we are in a meeting but we have not taken such decision. “This is election period and as commissioners, we meet every time”.
