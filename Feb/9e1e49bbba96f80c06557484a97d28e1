By Emmanuel Oloniruha Abuja – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the judgment of the Supreme Court that nullified primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers state, as victory for democracy and the rule of law. The party in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary,
Mr Kola Ologbondiyan on Friday in Abuja commended the apex court for its
courage in delivering what it described as landmark judgment. Ologbondiyan said that the judgment had saved the nation from a
serious constitutional crisis that could have marred the 2019 general
elections and detract from Nigeria overall electoral system. “The judgment of the Supreme Court serves as a huge lesson to
politicians and political parties, to eschew impunity and always conduct
their affairs in a manner that is in tandem with the provision of the
law. “The courage displayed by the Supreme Court in delivering the
judgment at this critical time in our national life has also restored
the confidence of Nigerians in the institution of the Judiciary and our
democratic order. Ologbondiyan, however, urged PDP members across the country to
continue to work hard in consolidating on the already established
victory of the party in all elections, beginning with next Saturday’s
Presidential election. The Justice Mohammed Dattijo-led five-man panel of justices, on
Friday, upheld the annulment of the governorship primaries conducted by a
faction of the Rivers state chapter of the APC.(NAN)
