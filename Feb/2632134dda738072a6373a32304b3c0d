By Ruona Isikeh  Benin – Members of the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU), University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) branch, have embarked on a 3-day warning strike to press home their demands for improved working condition. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the union embarked the peaceful protest on Wednesday in compliance with a directive from its national secretariat. The workers were ordered to commence the action on Feb. 11 to demand for the payment of their salaries for the months of April and May 2018. Mr Frank Igbinovia, the UBTH branch Chairman of JOHESU, in an interview with NAN, appealed to the Federal Government to approve the union’s demands. Igbinovia called on the Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole, to immediately intervene in the issues raised to avert a headlong industrial action. Some members of JOHESU during the protest rally across major streets in Benin held placards with various inscriptions like “Pay us our April and May 2018 salaries” and “Stop the discrimination against health professionals”. JOHESU is accusing the federal government of enforcing its no-work no-pay policy in favour of medical doctors.
