Maradun – Gov. Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara says his administration is worried over increasing cases of kidnapping “that has become a lucrative business in the state’’. Yari made the statement at Maradun
community in the Maradun Local Government Area of the state on Friday,
when he visited the Emir of Maradun, Alhaji Garba Tambari in his palace. The governor visited the royal father in continuation of his governorship campaign. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
reports that Zamfara in Nigeria’s northwest has been contending with a
deadly banditry and herdsmen attacks that have claimed hundreds of lives
in recent years. “l cannot see the possibility of
abduction cases coming to an end in Zamfara State because the
perpetrators have now turned it into a business venture. “House owners rent out their
property to anyone who comes, especially the highest bidders. So, the
criminals hatch their plans in the privacy of their rented homes before
they lay siege on innocent people. “l wish to reiterate my earlier call
on traditional rulers to be vigilant on strangers coming to settle in
their domains and for landlords to also investigate their tenants to be
and not to be lured by the money such persons offer them,” he said. The governor, however, lauded the
efforts of security operatives, especially the civilian joint taskforce
created by the state last November to fight crime in the state. Yari appealed to Zamfara residents to come out en-mass on election days to vote for their candidates of choice. In his response, Tambari, assured
the governor that his subjects would come out in en mass on elections
days to discharge their civic duties.
