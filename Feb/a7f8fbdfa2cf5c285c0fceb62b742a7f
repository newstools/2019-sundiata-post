By Ibrahim Kado Gombe – Mrs Eunice Dogo, Electoral Officer (EO), Gombe Local Government has called on women to take advantage of the remaining hours to collect their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) before the expiration of the Feb. 8 deadline. Dogo made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Gombe on Thursday. She said that the number of women coming out to collect the cards had
not been encouraging, hence the need for them to use the remaining
hours to collect their PVCs. Dogo said the call was necessary so as to enable them to exercise
their civic responsibility and to vote for credible persons as their
leaders for the next four years. “The distribution of the PVCs is being conducted at the Registration
Areas but unfortunately majority of those coming to collect the cards
are men, the women are very few, most of them have refused to come and
collect. “Now the majority of the uncollected PVCs are for the women, please
before the end of Friday, Feb. 8 come and collect your PVCs, because, we
are going to close till after the elections for the continuous
registration and collection,” she said. She assured that people who were at the centre for collection on the
closing day would be attended to on that very day even if its 6:p.m. Dogo further said that the turnout for the collection on Thursday was very encouraging but that the women were still very few
