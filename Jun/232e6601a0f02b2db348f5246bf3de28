By Abdullahi Shugaba Dutse – Farmers in Jigawa, say they have started planting seeds for the 2019/2020 cropping season because of the onset of the rainy season. A cross section of farmers in the state made this known in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Friday in Dutse. Malam Sule Abu of Limawa Ward of Dutse, told NAN that he had already planted millet on his farm and the seeds had started to germinate “very  well”. Abu said that he was impressed with what he had planted on his farm and prayed for stable rainfall. He said that majority of farmers across the state had already planted seeds as a result of predictions by the National Meteorological Agency (NEMA) that rainfall would stop early this year. Hajiya Hadiza Abubakar, female farmer in Cheichei village in Ringim Local Government said that she had also planted beans and maize on her farm. Hadiza said that with steady rainfall, she was expecting 50 to 70 bags of beans from her farms this year. Malam Haladu Wanzam, another farmer from Kalawa in Ringim, appealed to Jigawa government to provide fertiliser and other farm inputs to farmers early enough for good yield. Wanzam said that farmers do not get fertiliser early enough, adding that it was one of the challenges of farmers. (NAN)
