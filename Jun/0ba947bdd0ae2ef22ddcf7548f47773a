By Ibrahim Kado Amada – Mr David Markson, State Coordinator, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Gombe State, has appealed to the state government to urgently provide a permanent Orientation Camp and equipment. Markson made the plea at the swearing-in ceremony of 2019 Batch B Stream 1 Corps members at Amada temporary Orientation Camp, Akko Local Government on Thursday. “I appeal to His Excellency to as a matter of urgency come to our aid in that regard by getting us a befitting edifice as a permanent orientation camp. “A water tanker and official vehicles to ease inspection of corps members in their various locations in the state,’’ he said. Markson said that NYSC was holding orientation courses for five years in a temporary facility following the use of the permanent site for another assignment. According to him, the absence of a permanent structure has not only affected activities of the scheme in the state but also the number of corps members deployed to the state. He urged the state government to improve the welfare of the corps members. Gov. Inuwa Yahaya, who was represented by his Deputy, Mr Manasseh Jatau, assured that his administration was committed to ensure security, welfare and well-being of every corps member deployed to the state. “We shall continue to collaborate with security agencies in the state to ensure security within and outside the camp for the safety of our dear corps members,” the governor said. Yahaya urged the corps members to choose a skill during the Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneur Development on camp to enhance national development and to also make them employers of labour.
