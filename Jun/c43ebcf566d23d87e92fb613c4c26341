Stefflon Don, British rapper and songwriter, says Burna Boy expressed his desire to marry her during their encounter in Ghana. The 27-year-old London-based R&B vocalist made this disclosure while narrating how she met the singer during an interview with Power 105.1, a radio station in Los Angeles. “Burna Boy is my baby. This is my ring. Next time, it would be his on my finger. I mean, he told me. I’m not just making things up. He’s Nigerian and you know Nigerian weddings are really big. I love Nigerian culture, its amazing,” she said. “I met him in Ghana. I was in Africa for a show. Then, I missed my flight. He also had a show where he performed and I went to the show. The rest is history baby. “He told me I was going to be his wife and you know how boys always talk shit. I didn’t remember he said that. But he told me and I was like ‘whatever’.” Stephanie Victoria Allen, who rose to fame after her 2017 single ‘Hurtin Me’ featuring French Montana, peaked at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart.
