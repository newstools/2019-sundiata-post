Tel Aviv – Israel and Hamas have reached an understanding on an extended calm along the Gaza border, a senior Hamas official said in Gaza early Friday. The agreement – brokered by the United Nations and Egyptian mediators – includes the renewal of fuel supply to the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian sources. The fisheries committee in Gaza said Israel would extend the zone allowed for fishing around the Gaza Strip. Earlier this month, Israel halted the transfer of fuel to the Gaza Strip’s only power plant in response to the launch of arson balloons that sparked raging fires in the south of the country. However, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment on the development. The agreement on restoring clam in the Gaza Strip was brokered just hours before Palestinians joined their weekly anti-Israel rallies that have been taking place in the eastern Gaza Strip since March 30 last year.
