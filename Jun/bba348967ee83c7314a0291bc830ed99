By Shovan Chowdhury 99.99% people donâ€™t follow these steps for thinking faster and betterway- the old man told me with calm and quiet voice. Yesterday I was discussing about thinking faster and better in the local meditation center of a yoga organization with an acquaintance person who has been meditating regularly last 30 years. I felt happy to discuss with him about several thought-provoking topic with a participative way. We agreed with each other about some points for thinking faster and better. Thinking faster and better is a long term process which will not be possible overnight. But if we try consciously to follow these 33 steps for one year, we can atleast really think faster, smarter and better than past. Source: Quora
