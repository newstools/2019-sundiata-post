John Obi Mikel recently sat down with the Super Eagles Media team to answer some quickfire questions on football, eating habits and his dressing style. His most interesting response was when he was asked to choose between Ronado and Messi, who have won a combined ten Ballon d’Or awards. Explaining why he picked the Barcelona superstar over the Juventus striker, Mikel said : ”Messi all day. For me, he is from a different planet. ”I’m grateful to have been able to play with him, from U20s we started playing against each other, played against him so many times”. When asked to choose between Lagos and Abuja, Mikel went for the country’s capital; he picked Yemi Alade as the better musician than Davido and prefers winning the World Cup over the Champions League. Naturally, the Blues legend preferred Chelsea to Arsenal, chose trophy over money and picked corporate over casual wears.
