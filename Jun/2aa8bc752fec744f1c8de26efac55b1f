A 20-year-old Romanian immigrant arrived in the UK on Friday, went shoplifting in the city on Saturday and is now off to custody. Leonard-Valter Tudor has gone to a TK Maxx store on Milton Street, Nottinghamshire, to steal accessories worth £508. District Judge Leo Pyle sent him to a young offenders’ institution for 16 weeks and ordered him to pay a £115 government surcharge.
