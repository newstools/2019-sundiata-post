Abuja
(Sundiata Post) –  The presidential
tribunal has rejected the request of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and
Atiku Abubakar, its presidential candidate, to access the server “used by the
Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) during the 2019 general
election”. PDP and Atiku had prayed
the tribunal to order INEC to grant them access to inspect the
commission’s server and other electronic gadgets used by INEC in the February
23 presidential election. The electoral commission
had responded saying it does not have a server where results of the
presidential election were uploaded. The application filed by the main opposition
party and its presidential candidate was dismissed by the tribunal on Monday. In a unanimous ruling, the panel upheld the
separation objections by the three respondents to the petitioners’ application. The respondents are INEC, Buhari and his party,
the All Progressives Congress (APC). Garba said INEC had denied having a server,
adding that granting the application would imply that the court had “indeed
recognised and found out that there is a central server into which results of
the held on February 23, 2019 were electronically transmitted by the 1st
respondent (INEC).” He said the Supreme Court had on many occasions
warned judges to desist from “making observations, comments or pronouncements
in its rulings with any likely effect of prejudging the main issue that can be
regarded as the issue to be tried in the course of trial.
