Any promised reforms by Ahmed Lawan and Gbajabiamila must start with massive reductions in their outrageous and unrealistic salaries and allowances. Their pay cheques is an albatross on the economy and insensitive to the millions of other ordinary voters who are buffeted daily by the Tsunami of pervasive poverty. Devoting N139.5 billion from the national budget to the comfort of fewer than five hundred lawmakers is not acceptable and sustainable. That a Nigerian Senator collects more salary than the United States President is scandalous and indefensible. Source: Facebook
