I saw video of where Reps members were snapping their ballot papers before casting their votes and the Clerk of the House was shouting that it was WRONG and ILLEGAL. My heart sank.

We will ensure no one is bribed before he or she does anything for the nation or this Honourable House.” Again, I said I have nothing against Gbajabiamila.
