After being tackled over a controversial statement he made yesterday, Uti has apologised. Princess criticised Uti’s statement Uti Nwachukwu has apologized and rephrased his earlier statement in which he said Cee-C is the “most successful housemate of the BBNaija 2018.” He has now rephrased it saying,  “CeeC is one of the most successful housemates of the BBnaija 2018” He was forced to rephrase the statement after another ex-housemate criticized the statement. Princess had criticized Uti saying a lot of housemates have suffered depression since leaving the house and are battling feelings of inadequacy. Therefore, to be compared amongst themselves is not cool. Well Uti has taken to Instastories to apologise, saying that he meant no harm and that the reason he can’t hide his feelings is because he is proud of Cee-C… See his apology below:
