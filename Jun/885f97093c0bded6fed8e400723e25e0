By Sani Abdulrahman Kaduna – A 42-year-old mechanic, Adamu Sulaiman of Unguan Shanu Rima road, on Monday, dragged his estranged wife before a Sharia Court l, sitting in Magajin Gari, Kaduna, seeking divorce confirmation. Sulaiman told the court that he proclaimed divorce twice to his wife and wants the court to confirm the final divorce. “She has six children from her previous marriage. Nonetheless, I married her and I have been taking care of all of them, together with the three children she had for me. “She does not seem to appreciate all my efforts to give her and all our children a comfortable life. All I get from her, is lack of care and insults. “On May 23, her brother who is a soldier threatened to kill me if he ever sees me  near their family house. “We have been living together in my wife’s parents house,” Sulaiman said. The defendant, Fatima Umar, however  denied the allegations. ”My parents accommodated us for free. Yet, my husband insults and disrespects them”, Umar said. The Judge, Alhaji Dahiru Lawal, confirmed the divorce and ordered the complainant to take custody of their three children.
