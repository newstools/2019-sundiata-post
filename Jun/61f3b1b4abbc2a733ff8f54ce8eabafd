By Masara Kim The Kogi State APC Stakeholders Forum on Sunday asked Governor Yahaya Bello to pay salaries and pension arrears to cushion the “prolonged hardship” experienced by workers in the State.
This was given as part of conditions for the reconciliation of warring factions of the ruling party.
Chairman of the Forum, Senator Alex Kadiri told the Governor during an interactive session in Abuja to implement the recommendations of the Tony Momoh and General Garba (Rtd) reconciliatory committees last year set up by Chief John Odigie Oyegun, the former national chairman of the party.
Senator Kadiri also reminded the governor to study and implement the resolutions reached during an interactive session with Vice-President Yemi Osibanjo before the last general elections for “genuine reconciliatory discussion”.
The vice president had asked the conflict parties in the ‘protracted’ party dispute to resolve their differences in the Party’s interest. In recent times Yahaya Bello has been having a running battle with the Kogi State Chapter of APC over ticket for the upcoming governorship election in the state.

While the governor is desirous of seeking the party’s nod for a second tenure, there is strong opposition to his second term bid. (MKReporters Network)
