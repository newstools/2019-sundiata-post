He rewarded the losers with automatic tickets at the expense of those who won the primaries. The defeat of Senator David Umaru at the Supreme Court and and the declaration of Sani Musa as the validly and legitimately elected candidate for Niger East senatorial election is a blow to impunity and arrogance.
