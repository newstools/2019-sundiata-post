Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has dismissed Bukola Dakolo’s rape allegation against Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo as falsehood. Mrs Dakolo in an interview with Chude Jideonwo on YNaija TV revealed that as a teenager in the Divine Delight Club, the precursor to COZA, she was groomed and raped by the pastor. The mother of three said it happened while she was a 16-year-old secondary school student living with her parents in Ilorin, Kwara State. Dismissing her allegation in several tweets on Friday, Mr Omokri said her story would not pass if subjected to cross examination in a law court. He said that he never liked Fatoyinbo for personal reasons but thought the preacher was too ‘sleek’ to ‘rape an underaged girl in her parents’ house’. Omokri described himself as ‘an advocate of morality’ who publicly preaches against premarital and extramarital sex. He said he pastored a congregation in Abuja for years and would ‘never, ever, support rape’, but added that ‘Satan is going about like a roaring lion seeking whom to consume!’ 1-I have NEVER liked Pastor @BiodunFatoyinbo of @cozaglobal for reasons that I will not say publicly. However, I am mature enough to divorce my emotions and be led by logic. And I counsel those now condemning him to do the same. #ForTheBodyOfChristNotForFatoyinbo 2-The average Black African is easily moved to hysteria by excitable emotions. This is why it is RIDICULOUSLY easy to manipulate Africans with the media Satan does his best work with such people, who can’t suppress emotion in preference to logic #ForTheBodyOfChristNotForFatoyinbo 3-Think. Dont emote. A pastor comes to your house early in the morning. He does not know who will open when he knocks, or who is at home. He knocks and immediately you open he pushed you to a chair and raped you in your pyjamas. Do people think? #ForTheBodyOfChristNotForFatoyinbo 4-Even the most USELESS movie director wont accept such a plot in a B rated Hollywood/Nollywood/Bollywood movie. A movie has to have PLAUSIBILITY. I dont like pastor Fatoyinbo, but I won’t suspend my intellect because of my dislike of the fellow #ForTheBodyOfChristNotForFatoyinbo 5-After he allegedly raped you, you kept quiet for enough time for him to go to his car and get a soda drink for you? It does not ADD UP. My dislike for @BiofunFatoyinbo won’t make me become a SLANDERER by default. This story rings very FALSE #ForTheBodyOfChristNotForFatoyinbo 6-I am an advocate of morality. I publicly preach against premarital and extramarital sex. I pastored a congregation in Abuja for years. I will NEVER, EVER, support RAPE. But satan is going about like a roaring lion seeking whom to consume! #ForTheBodyOfChristNotForFatoyinbo 7-Pastor @BiodunFatoyinbo is SLEEK. Too sleek for my liking. What type of sleek man will rape an underaged girl in HER PARENTS HOUSE. While HER SIBLINGS are AT HOME. And then leave her to go get a drink from his car. Is this mass HYPNOSIS #ForTheBodyOfChristNotForFatoyinbo 8-Do we Black African of the Nigerian variety think at all? Do we only exist in the soulish realm? I have a Masters in Law from England. The story CANNOT stand up in court. The story CANNOT stand up in the light of cross examination #ForTheBodyOfChristNotForFatoyinbo 9-I give you my word that if you gave satan 10 minutes to manipulate the minds of Nigerians, he will get a sizeable number of Nigerians to believe that Jesus is evil and he satan is good. We are too gullible, excitable and emotional #ForTheBodyOfChristNotForFatoyinbo
