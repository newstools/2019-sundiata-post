Police in Central Nigeria say Monday’s attackers who killed a soldier and three others in Plateau State are still ‘unknown’. “The villagers claim that Fulani herdsmen carried out the attack but we have yet to verify,” The State Commissioner of Police, Isaac Akinmoyede told journalists in Jos. The attack in Kangboro village, Riyom Local Government Area reportedly occurred at about noon, leading to the destruction of at least 50 houses. The attack is “yet another sad commentary in our quest for lasting peace,” said Senator Istifanus Gyang, representing Plateau North in the Nigerian National Assembly. His counterpart in the House of Reps, Simon Mwadkon shares same position. “The attack is shocking, barbaric, inhuman and thus condemnable,” said the member representing Riyom Federal Constituency in a press statement. No statement has been received from state or military authorities.
