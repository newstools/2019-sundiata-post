By Ray Schilling Dr. Longo has done a lot of animal experiments with intermittent fasting and longevity. Here are the results that he shared at last year’s Anti-aging Conference in Las Vegas. We know from these animal experiments that mice have a threefold increase in life span. But when heart attack rates and stroke rates improve in humans, cancer cure rates improve and telomere length in humans increase, there is strong evidence that it increases human life expectancy as well. It may take another 10 to 20 years before we have better statistics about the real survival advantage on this diet versus the Standard American diet. But what we know now is a start. I am writing this in Las Vegas. Tomorrow the yearly Anti-Aging Conference is starting at the Venetian Palace. Dr. Longo will be the key note speaker tomorrow morning. If this adds anything significant I may add it below. Addendum Dec. 13, 2018: The lecture by Dr. Longo did provide more human data. Patients undergoing chemotherapy tolerate and survive chemotherapy much better when combined with the fasting mimicking diet (FMD). The human data is very similar to the mouse model data. This human research was done at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, Germany. Dr. Longo is starting to engage in clinical trials by partnering with physicians, but this will take several years to be published. In the meantime the FMD is an effective way to rejuvenate on an ongoing basis. Since last year I underwent 12 monthly courses of 5-day FMD per month. Dr. Longo says that even 3 to 4 courses of FMD per year would have a rejuvenating effect. Source:Quora
