 GMAT (Graduate Management
Admissions Test) is the standardized test used by a wide range of
business and management schools to find the right candidates for
their next academic year. The business schools use the GMAT score of
applicants to predict if they are eligible for a specific course or
not. The

learned in your school and college. The test is divided into four
computer-based sections that are supposed to be completed within
3.5-4 hours. The candidates don’t need to feel worried or
overwhelmed about the test as they don’t need to be a wizard at
maths or have high-level English vocabulary skills to take the test. Each
section of the exam simply tests your higher-order reasoning skills
including your ability to analyze, evaluate and synthesize
information. Along with that GMAT
