The decomposing body of a 16-year-old housemaid allegedly killed and dumped in the bush by the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Mashi Local Government Area, Garba Talawai, has been found by the police, a report by DailyNigerian has revealed. The deceased teenager, Rabi Abdullahi, was a housegirl to the DPO’s girlfriend, Sadiya Danyaya the report stated. The DPO, who allegedly impregnated the girl, made unsuccessful efforts to abort the pregnancy that resulted to the death of the girl. “When he realised that she died, the DPO sought the help of another policeman to dump the body in the bush,” said a source in the town who preferred not to be named. Already the Katsina Police Commissioner, Sanusi Buba, has ordered the arrest and detention of Mr Talawai, a superintendent of police, after a preliminary report indicted him in the murder. In a statement by the command’s spokesman, Gambo Isa, Rabi’s corpse was discovered at a bush path in Mashi on Thursday. Mr Isa, a superintendent of police, noted that while at the hospital, some staff identified the corpse to be the one brought by the DPO and one policeman on Wednesday. According to the spokesman, the DPO’s girlfriend had confirmed to the police that Rabi was her maid and that she had been missing since Wednesday — an incident she reported to the DPO. Safiya told investigators that Rabi went missing after she rebuked her for carrying unwanted pregnancy. Mr Isa noted that both the DPO and his girlfriend, Safiya have been detained for thorough investigation to determine their culpability in the murder. He said a new Divisional Police Officer has already been posted to Mashi. “The Commissioner of police, Katsina state Command, CP Sanusi Buba, psc, assures the parents of the deceased and indeed the good people of Katsina state that the command will not leave any stone unturned until justice is done in the matter,” the statement added.
