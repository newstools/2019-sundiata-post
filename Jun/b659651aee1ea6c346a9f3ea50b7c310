There was media report that President Muhammadu Buhari approved the establishment of state and local government police. He also approved the dismissal of 37 police officers as recommended by the National Human Rights Commission Presidential Special Panel on SARS Reforms. But, the presidency through head of digital Communication, Tolu Ogunlesi said there was nothing like approval for the establishment of state and local government police. Ogunlesi made the denial known through his twitter handle after the report had gone viral. He said,”There were no “approvals” given. Ceremony was for submission of Panel Report (more than 2,000 pages long) – which made several recommendations. President received Report & directed IGP, Min of Justice & NHRC to “work out modalities for implementation within 3 months.” Source
