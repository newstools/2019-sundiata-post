According to him, “During preliminary investigation, the apprehended suspects confessed to have been involved in the recorded kidnapping incidents in the general area, as well as sending their victims to their ring leaders that are based in the deep forest at Ruwan-Godiya. Consequently, troops further exploited deep into Ruwan-Godiya Forest setting Bandits/Kidnappers hideouts on fire. “Troops continued to dominate the area with patrols, to deny the bandits/kidnappers freedom of action. “Members of the public are again enjoined to give credible information about suspicious movements of bandits and criminals to the nearest army or any other security agencies for necessary action.”  Source: News Express
