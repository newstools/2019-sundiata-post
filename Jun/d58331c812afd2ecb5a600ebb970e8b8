By Dorcas Elusogbon Ile-Ife (Osun) – An Ile-Ife Magistrates’ Court in Osun on Wednesday ordered that one Ojo Adebayo should be remanded in police custody for allegedly stealing four cows. The Prosecutor, Insp. Emmanuel Abdullahi, told the court that Adebayo committed the offence on June 21 at around 1:00 a.m. at No. 20, Dactov Hotel Road, Ile-Ife. Abdullahi said that Adebayo, 33, conspired with others now at large to commit felony to commit the offence. He added that the defendant allegedly stole four cows tied at the back of a shop, belonging to one Soliu Ajiwon, valued at N420, 000. According to him, the defendant conducted himself in a manner likely to cause breach of peace with the sudden disappearance of the four cows bought from Ibadan in Oyo State. The prosecutor said the offence contravened Sections 249 (d), 390 (9) and 516 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun State, 2002. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the three-count charge of conspiracy, stealing and breach of peace. The Defence Counsel, Mrs Innocental Akhigbe, applied for the bail of the defendant, pledging that her client would not jump bail. Magistrate Habibat Basiru, did not grant bail to the defendant, but ordered his remand in police custody and adjourned the case until July 17. (NAN)
