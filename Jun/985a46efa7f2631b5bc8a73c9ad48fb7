Kevin Aje. A statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina in Abuja on Thursday, said the president also condoled with the entire Catholic community in the country on the demise of Aje. The Bishop Emeritus, aged 85, served as a priest for almost 50 years, retiring at Sokoto in 2011.
