“My wife suddenly just fired my driver and gate man without informing me about it, I came home and she told me that they insulted her. Fast forward to one year later, I mistakenly cheated with her kid sister and she found out, I begged and begged my soul out, the only thing that I did not give her was my life but she kept saying she was fine when I knew she was not. So recently, I called her into the room and went on my knees as usual to beg and beg again. i was even crying . All she did was laugh so loud, I felt it was getting to her and she was losing her mind then I held her hands and hugged her so tights, do you know what she told me as I hugged her, she said that , Baby do you know why I fired our former gate man and driver , I nodded my head and she said , it was because I Slept with them . I pushed her away then she smiled and walked away. This morning she told me it was a joke and she has forgiven me. I am really worried, did she really do that? If she did then I think we are done. Do you think I should investigate further or just let sleeping dogs sleep? This has been hunting me I don’t have peace.”
