Check this under an “over-rated” President with FAKE integrity: Over two years ago, the IAAF mistakenly sent us $150,000 instead of $15,000. The athletics body has since been asking our own local federation to return the $135,000 over-paid to us. But we have SHAMELESSLY and CRIMINALLY refused. In fact, our Sports Minister even had this to say: “Did we steal money from them? Did we ask them to transfer money to us? They transferred money to us, they confirmed the transaction to us, then after two months, they woke up from slumber.” This low-mind did not even consider the implication of this on the image of this nation or how it will affect us in the future and in terms of our relationship with the IAAF. He was just behaving like a misguided teenager who singing: “Maga don pay, shout Hallelujah.” Now, you can imagine if this had happened under a certain Goodluck Jonathan. Just imagine what some educated illiterates would have been saying. I have nothing personal against Buhari and APC but just cannot stand this indescribable hypocrisy! This government is the biggest scam ever sold to Nigerians… Source: Facebook
