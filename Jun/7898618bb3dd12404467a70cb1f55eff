Super Eagles captain, John Obi Mikel has revealed that he advised his former teammate, Victor Moses not to honour an invitation to be part of Nigeria’s squad to the 2016 Olympic Games. Mikel also revealed that it was former Chelsea boss, Antonio Conte who forced him out of the club in January 2017. National U23 team coach, Samson Siasia had invited Moses as one of the overage players considered to beef up the Dream Team VI. Moses was called up along with Mikel, Odion Ighalo, Godfrey Oboabona and goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi. However, Moses had to stay back at Chelsea and fight for a first team spot during pre-season training with new coach Conte. Mikel told Super Eagles Media team that ”When that opportunity came up – either to go to Rio Olympics or play for Chelsea – I decided to tell Victor Moses because I was older, he’s young, he hasn’t played yet for the club. I told him I’ll go and he stays back. ”If I lose my place it’s fine, Victor stayed and I went. I came back, the manager never spoke to me again, didn’t put me in the team and I said okay fine, I’ll leave. ”The commitment and love that I have for my country will never change until I stop playing. ”Right now it will be difficult to find young players who will be able to do that for the national team because the agents make money from the clubs.” The former Chelsea star is the only player to represent the country at U17, U20 and senior World Cups, Olympic Games and Confederations Cup.
