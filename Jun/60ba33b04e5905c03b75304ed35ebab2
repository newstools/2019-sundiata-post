Bangkok – Thai junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha was officially endorsed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn as prime minister on Tuesday, almost a week after he won an overwhelming victory in parliament.“My family and I will forever owe a debt of gratitude to His Majesty’s kindness,’’ Prayut said in a speech at Government House.“I affirm that I will dedicate myself to public service with honesty and integrity,’’ he added.The 65-year-old retired general seized power in a May 2014 coup and made himself prime minister the same year.In a bid to give himself legitimacy to continue to rule, Prayut’s regime allowed an election to be held but rigged the rules in its own favour.It included hand-picking all 250 senators and granting them the right to vote for the prime minister alongside the elected lower house.The Senate’s votes, together with the votes from the pro-military Palang Pracharat Party and its allies, cemented Prayut’s victory with 500 votes.The number clocked two-thirds of the 750-member parliament when it convened for the first time since the March election.Prayut’s rule will transition from a military dictatorship to semi-democracy.Although the king’s endorsement on Tuesday is a matter of formality, analysts say that without the king’s backing, Prayut would not have all the support required to continue his rule.It is not immediately known when a new government will be formed to take office.The king was not physically present to give Prayut his support.He spends the majority of his time in Germany, where he has a private villa.
