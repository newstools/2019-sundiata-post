The apex Igbo sociocultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has slammed President Muhammadu Buhari for attending a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Countries in Saudi Arabia less than 24 hours after his swearing-in for a second- term. In a statement by its Deputy National Publicity Secretary, the group said Buhari owed Nigerians an explanation. Ohanaeze said, “Why immediate attendance of Organisation of Islamic Countries, OIC, meeting in Saudi Arabia a day after his swearing in. Mr President Buhari owes Nigerians that explanation.’’ Ohanaeze said, “This is a secular country and a leader that wants to be a mullah or fanatic is free to resign rather than plunge us into a religious crisis.” The group also attacked the Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, for travelling to Saudi Arabia for lesser Hajj. The statement said, “Femi Gbajabiamila, a born again Christian turned into Muslim for political reasons is dangerous to our democracy. “Although people have a right to change their religion, the sudden change from a Christian to a Muslim and his umrah journey to Mecca just to be Speaker is a bad omen. “Can we trust such a character who can change his faith for power sake?” Source: punch
