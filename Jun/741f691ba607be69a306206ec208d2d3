By Habibu Harisu Sokoto – Dr. Kayode Olagunju, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Zonal Commander in charge of Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara States, has warned personnel against delays in responding to distress calls. A statement issued by Zonal Education Officer, Mr Aliyu Ma’aji, on Tuesday, said Olagunju gave the warning on Tuesday in Sokoto during a drill competition organised for personnel of the corps drawn from the three states in the zone. The drill was organised as part of efforts to enhance efficiency as well as fitness among the personnel. Olagunju underscored the importance of the exercise stressing that it was a way of assessing the officers’ fitness, their response to commands and level of their discipline. “Drills like these enhance discipline as the guards are expected to respond to instruction uniformly and be able to display endurance of long hours standing. “As a responsive organisation, we regularly review the quarter guards and refill the performance of the guards to reflect on their level of discipline, fitness, endurance and efficiency.” Olagunju explained. He urged the officials to ensure swift response to rescue calls from road users in order to ensure effective service delivery. “I call on all FRSC personnel to be dedicated to their duties as the management will ensure proper implementation of the reward and punishment policy of the corps,” he added. He stated that the command would put in place measures to ensure stiff sanctions on erring officials, specifically those who indulged in bribery and other corrupt practices within the system. Olagunju said that the FRSC had ensured increased working partnership with stakeholders in safeguarding lives along the highways. He urged motorists in the zone to be safety conscious, urging them to avoid overloading, speeding and dangerous driving at all times. Sokoto RS10.1 was declared the overall winner in both parade and quarter guard inspection.
