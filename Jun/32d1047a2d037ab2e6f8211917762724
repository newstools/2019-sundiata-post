Former Secretary to the Federal Government Babagana Kingibe has claimed that former President Obasanjo was one of the architects of the June 12 annulment. See who is talking! We can’t forget his perfidy. Kingibe was Abiola’s running mate, but as soon as the election was annulled, he opportunistically deserted Abiola and took up appointment under General Sani Abacha. He was never part of the June 12 struggle nor did he identify with people like Tinubu who risked their lives for the revalidation of Abiola’s mandate. Why is this man insulting our intelligence and offending our sensibilities at this point in time when we are honouring Abiola, a man he had brutally and unblushingly betrayed? He lacks the credibility to speak about June 12. He should stop dancing on Abiola’s grave and pretending to speak for a cause he pussilamously abandoned to dine and wine with the enemies of democracy. You can’t profit from Abiola’s misfortune and now claim a moral high ground to criticize Obasanjo over June 12. Source: Facebook
