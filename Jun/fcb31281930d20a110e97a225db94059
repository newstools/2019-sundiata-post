By Chijioke Ogbodo It was an emotion laden moment in Lugano, Switzerland as a Nigerian priest, Rev. Fr. (Dr.) Gerald Ani, broke down in tears as his parishioners sang him an Igbo song. Gerald Ani, an Agbani, Enugu State-born parish priest of St. Ambrose Catholic Church Barbengo (at Lugano) and St. Christopher Grancia (Canton Ticino), Switzerland was celebrating a mass to mark his 10th anniversary of priesthood. The celebration, which attracted other faithful and friends of the priest from Italy, his former parish, St Cosmos and Damian, Mendrisio (Ti), others from Croatia and the members of the Anglophone Catholic Chaplaincy in the Diocese of Lugano of which he is the Chaplain, had some Nigerian priests from Nnewi Diocese. High point of the occasion was when the parishioners made up of mostly Caucasians took the congregation by surprise and rendered a song in Igbo language, Lee m anya na mkpuruobi (Examine my heart). At that point Father Ani was moved to tears in thanksgiving to God for the progress he has made as a priest.
