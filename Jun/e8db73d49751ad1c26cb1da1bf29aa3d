Abuja (Sundiata Post)
–  President Muhammadu Buhari has moved
to save the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, (APC) Comrade
Adams Osiomhole as he has waded into the crisis rocking the Edo State chapter of
the party ahead of next year’s governorship election in the state. Some members of the APC
under the auspices of the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM) have vowed to stop
Governor Obaseki from securing the party’s ticket to run for the election. The EPM members who claim
to be loyalists of former Governor Adams Oshiomhole accused Governor Obaseki of
alienating those that brought him to power and destruction of former Governor
Adams Oshiomhole’s legacies. Sources however told our
reporter that President Buhari waded into the crisis by calling for a truce
between Governor Obaseki and Oshiomhole. The source said Governor
Obaseki was at the villa on Friday to brief the President about his 2020
ambition and those opposing him. According to the source
who asked not to be named, the President asked Obaseki to meet with his
predecessor, Oshiomhole and he got them talking. It was learnt that the
intervention of Buhari made a meeting between Oshiomhole and Obaseki to be held
in Abuja in the presence of some top personalities and party chieftains. According to the source,
“Last night, President Buhari got Oshiomhole and Obaseki talking. This is the
same Obaseki that said he can never see Oshiomhole. “He is now
stretching the olive branch but his aides are not sincere with him. Oshiomhole
remained a constant equation in the whole arrangement. He has never spoken
about Edo 2020.” Culled from The Nation.
