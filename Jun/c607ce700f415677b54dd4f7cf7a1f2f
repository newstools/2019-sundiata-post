Pastor Tony Rapu has reacted to the r*pe allegation against Pastor Fatoyinbo, a former member of the COZA which he is a founder. Recall we reported yesterday that Busola in an interview granted to Ynaija, revealed that she was r*ped by the popular pastor while she was a teenager. However Fatoyinbo released a statement on his official Instagram page to debunk the allegations levelled against him, saying several statements had been made to extort the church through blackmail, harassment and intimidation. However Pastor Tony Rapu who reacted to the r*pe allegation against Pastor Fatoyinbo, stated that many leaders lack the confidence to address s*xual abuse because they do not feel adequately equipped to handle the complexities involved. He added that we all need to understand how this issue of s*xual abuse can be addressed, in the light of the Gospel. He wrote; “Many leaders lack the confidence to address s*xual abuse because they do not feel adequately equipped to handle the complexities involved. Others do not have sufficient training to address the challenges s*xual or even domestic abuse matters throw up. We need to understand how this issue of s*xual abuse can be addressed in the light of the Gospel.” Source
