Having a new man in her life, who is not the father of her baby, Mimi was faced with the challenge of fallen breasts. “People keep wondering how I keep my man even after having my daughter, Jasmine. It is not about slaying and going slim after birth. It is about when you go naked. My baby sucked for 15 months and few days then my average standing boobs fell to my tummy. I lost it. “I lost my confidence. I couldn’t even look at a mirror. I hated having a bath. I even considered going under the blade but the fear of what might happen next wouldn’t let me. “At that point, I knew that surgery wasn’t an option for me. I couldn’t even discuss it with other women because they would tell me its a normal experience that every woman passes through. I was worried that my boobs were fallen and I couldn’t do anything about it,” Pearls News reported. However, Mimi Orjiekwe added that life became better got an idea of what to do through the aid of breast enhancing products. “I felt better after it helped me restore my confidence. My life never remained the same again.” Source
