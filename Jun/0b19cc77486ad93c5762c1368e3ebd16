By Melusi Mkwebu Aaaah! Seriously, Do you know how big is Africa and you are asking about Mo Salah ,yes he is one of the best player not overall the best in Africa. Why there is George Weah who won a ballon dor ,whilst playing for Ac Milan in the mid nineties ,remember there is Nwako Kanu who boasts of an Olympic medal ,premier league, Afcon trophies, remember there is Abedi Pele who won the Best African player more than 3 time’s. Remember Samuel Eto who won almost everything with Barcelona ,remember There is Roger Milla who pushed Africa for the 1st time in the quarter final of a world cup. Remember the skills of okocha ,Yaya Toure ,Adebayour ,Drogba .Mo Salah is a great footballer I don’t disagree with that ,but to say is the best in African football no. In conclusion I even forgot to mention Kalusha Bwalya,Seydou Keita .There are a lot of great footballers in Africa but I know Mo Salah is still upcoming, one day we will read him in history.
