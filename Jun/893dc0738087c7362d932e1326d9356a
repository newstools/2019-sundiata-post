By Ugochi Ugochukwu Abuja – The police on Tuesday arraigned a 32-year-old security guard, Emmanuel Bartholomew in a Zuba Upper Area Court, Abuja, for alleged negligence at his duty post. Bartholomew, who resides at No 8, 111 Road Gwarinpa, Abuja, was docked on one count of negligent conduct. The prosecutor, Mr. Chinedu Ogada, told the court that the complainant, Ms Jane Offia of the same address reported the matter at Gwarinpa Police Station, Abuja. Ogada said that John was employed to work as a  security guard and to secure the complainant’s compound at No 8, 111 Road Gwarinpa, Abuja. She added that the defendant abandoned his duty post and slept on duty. ”Bartholomew deliberately neglected his duty post, thereby paving way for thieves to have access to the property.” The thieves stole a 48-inch LG plasma television set worth N280,000,” she said. She said that Bartholomew could not give satisfactory account of the missing property during police investigation, an offence which contravened Section 196 of the Penal Code. The judge, Alhaji Gambo Garba, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N50,000 with one reliable surety in like sum. Garba ordered that the surety must reside within the jurisdiction of the court and adjourned the matter until July 1 for hearing.
