By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ Senator Ali Ndume has said that his is the winner of the senate presidency election that was conducted today and that his party should thank him for his involvement. Senator Ndume said his participation in the contest brought credibility to the process as the exercise would have been devoid of election without his insistence to offer himself for acceptance or rejection by senators- elect. According to him, the exercise would have brought criticism to the APC if Senator Lawan has emerged senate president unopposed and unchallanged. That is why I see myself as winner of this election today. He disclosed this to newsmen shortly after the election while reacting to his defeat by the former majority leader. Recall that Senator Ahmed Lawan had defeated Senator Ali Ndume to emerge the Senate President with 79 votes to 28, Senator Ahmed Lawan was the anointed candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress for the position of the Senate President of the 9th National Assembly.
