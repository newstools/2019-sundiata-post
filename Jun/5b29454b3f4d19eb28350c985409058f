Port Harcourt – Gov. Nyesom Wike of Rivers has called on Christian leaders across the country to encourage Christians to participate actively in politics to enhance governance and ensure development.Wike made the call on Friday in Port Harcourt, when Rt. Rev. Wisdom Ihunwo, the Anglican Bishop of Niger Delta North, paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House.According to the governor, Christian leaders can no longer afford to shy away from the country’s political arena in view of present day realities.He also urged the church to continue to pray for politicians and encourage Christians to participate more actively in politics.“Continue to pray for us, but encourage your members to participate actively in politics. There is no reason to stand aloof at this time.“When religious people are involved in politics, there is always a difference. If they participate, there will be an improvement in governance,’’ he said.The governor acknowledged the role played by the church in his re-election, and said that his administration would continually partner with the church to ensure rapid development of Rivers.He commended the Anglican Diocese of the Niger Delta North for its critical investments and projects which he said would help in stabilising the church.Ihunwo had earlier told Wike that his victory at the polls was a loud statement by Rivers people that they appreciated his performance during his first tenure in office.He said: “your electoral victory is a lesson to all to keep faith in all legitimate pursuits.’’The bishop, who also commended the governor for his commitment to a better second term blessed him and prayed God to give him the grace to end well.
