By Jason Land The Philippines is not an expensive country to live in. It’s relatively cheap to live and flourish in your life. I will soon be joining my wife in Philippines . It’s a great cultural country and it’s people . I’m so fed up with reading posts of negativity in regards to Philippines. That’s why so many people make posts of ‘what is it like to live in the Philippines ‘, ‘what are the people like in the Philippines’, how rich is the Philippines ‘. Most make the posts to get others to post negative comments. So please refrain from negative comments or posts about the Philippines. If you want to learn about the Philippines first hand, move there. Source: Quora
