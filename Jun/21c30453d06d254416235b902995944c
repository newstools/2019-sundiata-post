Other positions are yet to be announced. The NURTW president warned the interim committee and all members against involving the union in the affairs of any political party or discriminating against any member for political reason. He said that members of the union were free to belong to any political party of their choice but without involving the union. Yaseem however assured that the union would cooperate with the state government where necessary and prayed for Allah to grant the administration the wisdom to tackle the insecurity menace in the state.
