Clueless governors building airports in deserts and state capitals with little economic activity and human traffic. Some of them disguise their intentions by calling such airports cargo airports. Nonsense. One thing unites all these wasteful, stupid airport projects in remote state capitals: the governors building them have given up on road travel, having surrendered our roads to bandits and kidnappers. They now simply want to be able to charter private jets to get in and out of these state capitals. Most of our existing airports are underused, with one or two commercial flights a week. But they want to build more airports in towns that do not attract many people because they know that the insecurity on our roads and the terrible state of those roads will get worse. Some of these proposed new airports are barely one hour drives from existing airports. As is common with the Nigerian ruling class, they are spending public money to escape the bad roads and crime wave theyâ€™ve failed to tackle. The building of useless airports is the most eloquent statement yet of the hopelessness of the Nigerian situation, a testament to the total loss of confidence in the ability of Buhari to make our roads safe.
