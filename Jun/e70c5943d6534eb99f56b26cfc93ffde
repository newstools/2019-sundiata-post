Hon Ahmed Idris Wase has emerged the Deputy Speaker of the 9th Assembly of the Federal House of Representatives. Wase of the All Progressives Congress who represents Wase Federal Constituency of Plateau State in the Green Chamber was elected unopposed by his colleagues. Wase, who himself had earlier aspired to become Speaker of the ninth National Assembly, stepped down to deputise for Femi Gbajabiamila, the anointed candidate of the APC for the position after he was prevailed upon by the party to do so. After obtaining a National Diploma in Civil Engineering from the Plateau State Polytechnic in 1986, Hon Wase, born on June 1st, 1964, later obtained Higher National Diploma in Civil Engineering from Kaduna Polytechnic in 1995. In 2005, he was appointed as the Executive Secretary of the Plateau State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board, a position he held up to 2006 before his election to the Green Chamber by his constituents under the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) in 2007. Wase remains a committed member of APC after the merger that gave birth to the party. In his zeal to understand the dynamics of good governance and positive social change, he bagged an Executive Certificate in Strategic Governance in 2016 from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, United States.
