It has been reported that a 72-year-old prophet of Celestial Church of Christ in Ipaja area of Lagos state, Jacob Adegboyega Farinmade, has been arrested by men of the Lagos state police command for allegedly killing a female undergraduate, Bunmi, whom he impregnated. Local reports show that Bunmi was a student of Babcock university until 2014 when she was rusticated. Her father then took her to her mother, Derayo Omisibi’s house to stay for a while. Worried about the state of her daughter, Derayo went seeking for spiritual help. She took Bunmi to the cleric for spiritual cleansing. The cleaning required that Bunmi stayed in the church premises were the clergyman and his over 10 wives also reside. Sources said the cleric took advantage of Bunmi’s stay in his church to lure her to bed and impregnated her. He kept her in his church for the duration of her pregnancy and stopped her from receiving any ante-natal care. She died recently while trying to give birth to her baby. Instead of informing her mother about her demise, the clergyman hurriedly buried her in a shallow grave inside his church premises and thereafter called the mother to inform her that Bunmi had died. Trouble started when the father of the deceased could not reach his daughter. He reported the matter to the police and the clergyman was arrested. Confirming the incident, the spokesman of the state police command, Bala Elkanah, said the suspect would be charged to court soon for murder. Source
