By Constance Imasuen Abuja – The Federal Road Safety Unit 7.18 Lugbe, Abuja, in collaboration with Special Marshal of Unit 5, has donated food items and clothing materials to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Karamajiji, Airport Road, Abuja. Items donated include bags of rice, cartoon of indomie, clothing, among others. Mr Martins Ohiani, Unit Commander at Lugbe, while donating the items also educated the IDPs and drivers on issue of road safety. Ohiani, who said that many of the IDPs were drivers, urged them to be safety conscious to enjoy their livelihood. `Try to obey traffic rules and regulations by ensuring that you do not speed excessively while driving. “We are appealing to you not to carry overload in your vehicles, while driving on the expressway as this against the road safety rules. “We are also concerned about overloading as a lot of drivers along the Airport Road carry two people in front. “When you carry two people in front, they cannot use the seat belt and without the use of the seat belt, the safety we are talking about is removed,” he said. Ohiani also advised the IDPs to always ensure they use the footbridge while crossing the expressway for the purpose of safety.
