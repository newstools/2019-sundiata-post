President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, has charged the Nigeria Police Force to “pick up” the Senior Pastor of COZA Church, Biodun Fatoyinbo. Onochie said Fatoyinbo should be arrested and a polygraph test administered on him to prove if he is innocent or lying. Recall that wife of popular singer, Timi Dakolo, Busola had alleged that the COZA founder had forcefully raped her when she was young. The mother-of-three narrated how Pastor Fatoyinbo allegedly forced his way into her when she was a teenager. Fatoyinbo, however, denied the allegation, though admitted that Busola once attended the same church with his family. The clergyman consequently ordered his lawyers to institute both criminal and civil cases against Busola. Weighing in on the saga, the presidential aide in a tweet wrote: “He raped me – Busola “I didn’t rape her – Fatoyinbo “Me: What is the Police waiting to invite this alleged rapist for questioning? This may lead to a polygraph or lie detector, telling us who is telling the truth. @PoliceNG pick him up, same way you’ll pick up an accused poor man! “They do in many nations. They prosecute those who committed the alleged crimes and also prosecute those who make false allegations “Like that, people would think seriously before making false allegations. The society is better off. “How can a murdered person make a formal report?”
