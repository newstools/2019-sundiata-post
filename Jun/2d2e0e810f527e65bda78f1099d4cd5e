The defendants: Joseph Atolagbe, 45; Fada Adua, 37 and Ayayo Omike, 20; all residents of Ikeja, Lagos, were docked for conspiracy and damage. The prosecutor, ASP Clifford Ogu, told the court that the defendants committed the offences on May 4, 2019 at Ikeja. He said that the defendants conspired and maliciously damaged the complainant’s fence with the intention of encroaching into his land. Ogu said that the complainant, Omojola, reported the case to the police station and the defendants were arrested. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 350 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 350 prescribes two years’ jail term for damage while Section 411 also attracts two years for conspiracy if found guilty.
