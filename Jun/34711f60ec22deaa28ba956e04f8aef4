Defender Abdullahi Shehu has been ruled out of Super Eagles’ opening game against Burundi at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations on Saturday. The Turkey based defender was ruled out due to injury, according to allnigeriasoccer.com. The fullback failed a fitness test leading up to the Saturday clash and it is foregone conclusion that he will not be selected to face Burundi. Head coach of Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr hinted at Friday’s pre-match press conference that one player will sit out today’s game. He did not, however, revealed the identity, only stating that the player is sick. Shehu was one of the first players that fell ill upon the team’s arrival in Ismailia for the second phase of preparations. The team is ‘distracted’ heading to the opener against Burundi, with uncertainty surrounding the fitness of Ahmed Musa, Henry Onyekuru, Leon Balogun and Paul Onuachu.
