Head coach of Nigeria, Gernot Rohr, has revealed that he has already mapped out his starting XI that will tackle Guinea in Wednesday’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, Group B fixture. The Germany tactician stated that only fittest Super Eagles players will start against the Syli Stars, adding that a victory for the three times African champions will seal Nigeria’s qualification into the competition’s next round. Nigeria head to the match after defeating Burundi 1-0 over the weekend, while Guinea played a draw against Madagascar. Addressing a press conference on Tuesday morning in Egypt, Rohr said: “Yesterday’s afternoon we put together already the team who could start eventually in this crucial game against Guinea because if we win it we are already through to the next round of the competition. That would be wonderful you know. “At the moment the atmosphere is very good. The players are recovering and we will also prepare specially for those that are sick and to try to come back in good fitness. “We had a very good training session this morning. We had a recovery program for the players who played more than 45 minutes against Burundi on Saturday. “We had a big work which dwelled on physical and technical training for the other players too.” The kick-off time for the match is 3:30 pm.
