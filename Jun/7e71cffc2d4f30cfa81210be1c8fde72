The management of Nigerian musician, Naira Marley has given the real reason why the singer is still being detained at the Ikoyi prisons after being granted bail. Marley was on Thursday granted two million naira bail with two sureties in like sum by Justice Nicholas Oweibo at the federal high court in Ikoyi. The judge said one of the sureties must be a civil servant not below Grade Level 10 while the other surety must own a landed property in Lagos State. However, reports emerged on Thursday morning that the singer has not been able to provide a surety not below Grade level 10 and was therefore still been detained at the Ikoyi prisons. But, the management, in a post on Naira Marley’s Instagram page, denied the report making the rounds. They disclosed that the singer is still been detained because the EFCC was yet to inspect sureties’ address. The post read: “Hello Nigerians let us be smart, not everything you hear or read you should believe, the surety has been ready from the day they granted him bail, but we gotta wait for EFCC to go confirm the sureties address. “We are waiting for them to confirm and the court still needs to sign the release paper. “To everyone talking rubbish your time will come.” Source
