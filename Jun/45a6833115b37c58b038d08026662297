By Gami Tadanyigbe Kuje – A Kuje Upper Area Court, on Wednesday, sentenced a 23-year-old scavenger, Samaila Abu, to four months in prison for stealing 10 pieces of iron rods, valued at N25, 000. The judge, Abdullahi Abdulkareem,sentenced Abu after he pleaded guilty to criminal trespass and theft. Abu begged the court for leniency. But Abdulkareem, who did not give Abu any option to pay fine, said the punishment is to serve as deterrent to others with similar intentions. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Samuel Ocheche, told the court that  Mr Silas Noah, the complainant, who resides at Pegi area, reported the matter at the police station on June 15. Ocheche said Abu entered the complainant’s building site at odd hours and stole 10 pieces of iron rods worth N25, 000. He said the offence contravened the provisions of sections 348 and 288 of the Penal Code. He said during investigation, the stolen items were recovered from Abu when he tried to sell them.
