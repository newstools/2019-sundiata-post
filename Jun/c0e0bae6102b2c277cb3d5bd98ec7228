By Bruno Mirchevsky  Yes. There is no exception to this. One thing is for certain – people will always tell other people what they want to hear. And, in some instances, that is okay. Being honest is a great virtue, but it should never be just about being honest. You have to be smart too. Words can hurt and that is exactly why you should be very careful when being candid to whoever you are talking to. There is an essential difference between being honest for a good cause and being reluctantly honest. If you ask me, being too honest is a sign of low intelligence. Not all people or situations ask for your opinion so you should definitely not always express it. There are people in the world who are bullied every single day because their friends are ”honest”. The truth is their friends are not honest, but extremely toxic, mean and abusive. To be smartly honest means to recognize the people you can be honest towards. This does not mean that sensitive people do not deserve honesty, they do, but here also, you should play very intelligently. While others may welcome your criticism easily, sensitive people require a different approach. To be smart in your honesty means to recognize the right time, and the right words to say what you want to say. Therefore, being too honest can never be a sign of intelligence. More often than not, those that are too honest actually insult other people yet they think they are doing a good thing by being honest. Disrespecting someone does not mean you are honest. Insulting someone does not mean you are honest. Degrading someone does not mean you are honest. It means you are a senseless and an obviously unintelligent person. It hurts, huh? Well, sorry, but I am just being too ‘’honest’’. Source: Quora
