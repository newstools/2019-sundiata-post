He said, “This camp (Anguldi Jos IDP Camp) started with over 3000 people from 12 communities including three that only fled out of fear. “204 of those that fled out of fear from those three were mobilized back home by the government and the STF last year December. “However, some of them were forced back to camp after the houses they attempted renovating to serve as temporary IDP camps within the villages were destroyed by the herders overnight.” This according to the Community leader frustrates the IDPs’ dreams to return home to their normal lives.

At least 130,000 people were displaced from 11 villages, says the Plateau Indigenous Development Association of Nigeria, PIDAN.

The Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong on June 12 vowed to resettle all the IDPs in one year’s time.
