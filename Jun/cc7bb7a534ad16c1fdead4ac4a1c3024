ABUJA – Imediate past governor of Imo State Rochas Okorocha arrived National Assembly premises at 7:40.am ahead the inauguration on Tuesday. Okorocha, who was declared winner of the Imo West Senatorial District, was not issued certificate of return by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). However, a Federal High Court in Abuja last week ordered that Okorocha be given his return certificate. It was gathered that Okorocha was not accredited by the National Assembly management to attend the inauguration. It was not clear if INEC has complied with the directive. •Source: News Express
