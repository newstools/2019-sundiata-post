Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Governor of Rivers State Barr Nyesom
Wike has declared free education for public primary and secondary schools in the
state in a bid to create access to quality education, Wike directed
state-owned primary and secondary schools to stop collecting fees and
levies from students and pupils with immediate effect. He stated that
henceforth, the state government will be sending direct allocations  to
all primary and secondary schools management for their operations. He spoke, yesterday,
during a meeting with the heads of primary and secondary schools, Rivers 
State Senior Secondary Schools Board and State Universal Basic Education Board
at Government House, Port Harcourt. He said: “From today
henceforth, no child either in primary and secondary schools should pay fees
and levies in any school across the state. “ The monies you collect
from these children are just used for your personal purposes.  If I hear
that any school head collects any fees or levies, be they examination, NECO or
WAEC fees, that school head would be sanctioned. “We shall not only
dismiss the school head who collects fees or levies, we will prosecute 
the person  involved. Government will work out
grants that will be sent to the schools  for their regular management and
operations.” Wike directed the state
Ministry of Education, Rivers State Senior Secondary Schools Board and the
State Universal Basic Education Board to monitor all public schools 
across the state to ensure compliance.
