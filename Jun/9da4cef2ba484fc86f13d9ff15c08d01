By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – A strong contender for the senate presidency of the 9th Senate, Senator Ali Ndume has reacted to alleged endorsement of the former Majority Leader, Senator Ahmed Lawan by 61 APC senators, saying he is looking for votes and not endorsement. Recall that no fewer than 60 APC senators and 1 YPP senator on Saturday endorsed Senator Ahmed Lawan for the Senate President at Transcorp Hilton Abuja. Senator Ndume who appeared unperturbed by the endorsement said he was confident of winning on Tuesday. His words: “Well, I’ve said before that I am not looking for endorsement but looking for votes on election day. “You know clearly that there is the difference between endorsement and election. You would recall too that in 2015 that story of endorsement was canvassed. He had the endorsement but what happened on the floor of the Senate was different. “This kind of thing has been there all along, we have seen endorsements against several elections. We are there already and shall become past in question of hours from now.”
