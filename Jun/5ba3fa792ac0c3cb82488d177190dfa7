Residents living in and around Phalaborwa have been warned to be very careful after 14 lions escaped from Kruger National Park in South Africa. Limpopo-based radio stations Capricorn FM and 1NationFM reported on Friday morning that the lions escaped from the Kruger National Park on Thursday June 6th. The Limpopo government confirmed in a tweet that the lions were believed to have escaped and were seen roaming around the Phalaborwa Foskor Mine. “It is suspected that the lions escaped from Kruger National Park. The Limpopo Department of Economic Development, Environment, and Tourism (LEDET) has allocated field rangers to closely monitor the pride’s movement prior action to be taken,” “A meeting held between LEDET, The Kruger National Park and Greater Balule concluded that the lions are to be captured and released back at Kruger National Park. Employees at Foskor Mine and members of the public are hereby advised to be alert at all times.” It comes two days after Kruger National Park confirmed one of its staff member’s children had been mauled to death by a leopard. The leopard was later tracked and shot in other to prevent the animal from harming another person. Source
