By Jay Borwick Once when I visited Canada, I developed a leg infection that required a week long stay in a Canadian hospital. And although I was initially charged $12,000, I was able to negotiate that down to $8,000. Unfortunately, I did not have any insurance coverage so I paid with my credit card. After I immigrated to Canada and became a legal Permanent Resident, I have been in a Canadian hospital three times totalling seven weeks. All I had to pay for was the cable TV in my room. Also, I did not have to fill out any insurance forms or pay any deductibles. All I needed was to show my government health card. Canadian Permanent Residents and Canadian Citizens have the same government health benefits. Source: Quora
