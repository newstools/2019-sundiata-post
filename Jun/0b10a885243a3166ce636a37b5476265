By Samuel Ajayi I was speaking to a female friend here one day and she said: “I am daughter of so and so.” I am holding back the name of the pentecostal pastor/bishop she mentioned. And I said to her straightaway: “Nope! You are daughter of the Most High who attends the church of Pastor/Bishop so and so.” So many things have been happening to and in the church of God lately, and even for long, and these things fester because we have a bunch of CRIMINALLY PERMISSIVE FOLLOWERS. Let me make certain things very clear: Let me end this by saying that apart from being a PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN, my other ‘religion’ is FATALISM. I am staunch believer in Fate. What will be will be. If God says I am dying tomorrow, no one can reverse it. And if he says I will live to be 100, no one can change it. So being EMOTIONALLY ENSLAVED to any so-called man of God is an indication of your own SPIRITUAL LAZINESS. You have free access to God like your pastor. And no wonder many remain in what I call RELIGIOUS SERVITUDE!. Source: Facebook
