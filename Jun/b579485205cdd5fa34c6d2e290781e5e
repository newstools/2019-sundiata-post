Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Hon Abubakar Unisa (APC-Jigawa) has spoken on plan by some aggrieved lawmakers to unseat speaker Femi Gbajabiamila They had alleged vote-buying and the gross impunity by the Clerk of the National Assembly, Alhaji Sani Omolori, who supervised the June 11 election of Speaker and Deputy speaker in the House of Representatives.Spokesman of the new group, Honourable Mark Terseer Gbillah (PDP, Gwer West/Gwer East Federal Constituency, Benue state), said the lawmakers under the aegis of G-70, cut aross party lines. He said that while the members have no personal grudges against any one or political party, they will not condone any illegitimacy in the election of the person or persons who will lead the House of Representatives. “We condemn totally, the use of any form of financial inducement and systematic coercion to compel towards choosing a leader in a manner that totally destroys the sanctity and integrity of the House and the National Assembly as a whole. “We believe that if President Buhari himself truly preaches and believes in transparency and anti-corruption, then he should realize what his government and what whom he supported has done to become Speaker of the House. “We will explore every legitimate means possible to ensure that justice is done and genuine democratic norms prevail”, he said. Reacting, Unisa told NAN that members were engaging the group to sheath its swords. He said that “in any democratic elections, the majority would have their way while the minority will have their say”. Unisa, however, said that it was the duty of the winner to extend the olive branch to the loser in an election. He further disclosed that the major opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was preparing to pay a courtesy call on the speaker for discussions on the interests of all Nigerians and for nation building.
