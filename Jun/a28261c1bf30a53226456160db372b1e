By Debo Kayode Chaiiiiii! Who let you guys in on this one? Ayaf died o! The words Yoruba Demon started as a joke on social media around 2015 and has now become a tribal slur on our nice, gentle, good looking young Yoruba men. A Yoruba demon is a young good looking man of Yoruba origin (who else), who has a way with women. He is a seducer who lures women into his bedroom. He is said to be a playboy whose sole mission is to break the hearts of innocent women. He has a silver tongue, many girlfriends and an overactive sex life A Yoruba demon is typically a young man of Yoruba descent who has the uncanny gift to effortlessly make ladies fall head over heels in love with him. He is naturally a gifted smooth talker, a born Casanova and prides himself in been able to acquire a huge followership of female admirers and side chicks. He is also gifted at absolving himself of any responsibility in his relationships. Generally, he is a seductive cocktail of sweet and bitter. There is no going back after you date a Yoruba demon, you keep coming back for more. He goes after a young ladyâ€™s heart with no intention of loving her. They are typically seen at parties and would most likely wear big agbada. They sometimes are seen in groups. To young women they are the Pied Piper of Nigeria! Source: Quora
