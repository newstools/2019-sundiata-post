By Adenike Ayodele Ikeja – Three unemployed men, Victor Eneh, 25; Sunday Orogo, 20 and Amos Solarin, 20, on Wednesday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly belonging to an unlawful society. The trio were also alleged to have conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause a breach of peace by terrorising Odogunyan Community in Ikorodu. The defendants, whose residential addresses were not given, were arraigned on a two-count-charge of breach of peace and unlawful society. The Prosecutor, Insp. Victor Eruada, the defendants allegedly conspired and disrupted the peace of Ikorodu residents by belonging to an unlawful society known as Eiye Confraternity. Eruada told the court that the defendants committed the offence with others still at large on May 18 at about 6.30p.m in Odogunyan Area in Ikorodu, Lagos. “The policemen, while on routine patrol, were alerted by the vigilance group in Odogunyan that the defendants are planning to terrorise the community. “They were able to arrest the three, while others ran away,’’ he said. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the offences. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Dan Oni, admitted the defendants to bail of N100, 000 bail with two sureties in like sum. Oni ruled that the sureties must be gainfully employed with an evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government, and have their addresses verified by the court. The alleged offences contravene Sections 42 and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015, (Revised). The magistrate adjourned the case until July 3 for mention.
