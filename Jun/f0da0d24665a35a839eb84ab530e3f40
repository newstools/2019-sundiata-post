By Ngozi Njoku Lagos – The police in Lagos State on Thursday arraigned a 45-year-old mechanic, Nathaniel Olalekan, over alleged conversion of N190,000 given to him for repair of a car brain box. Olalekan, 45, who resides on Adebayo Street, Ogudu, Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of stealing and obtaining money under false pretences, before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the offences. The prosecutor, Insp. Lucky Ihiehie, said that the defendant committed the offences on April 10, 2018 at No. 7, Alake Lane, Ojota, Lagos State. Ihiehie said that the defendant collected the money from the complainant, Mr Odeleye Oluwaseun, on the pretext of repairing the brain box of his Ford car with registration number LSD-628 EQ. He said that the defendant did not repair the car  but converted the money to his personal use. “All efforts made by the complainant to get his money back failed,’’ he said. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. Section 287 stipulates three years imprisonment for stealing while Section 314 provides for 15 years jail term for obtaining under false pretences. The Magistrate, Mrs E. Kubeinje, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N100, 000 with two sureties in like sum. She said that the sureties should show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Kubeinje adjourned the case until June 23, for mention.
