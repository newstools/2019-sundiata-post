By Kathryn Berck Renouncing US citizenship is absolutely possible, but you have to realize that once you are no longer a US citizen you can’t – for example – immediately go back home to Texas or wherever and resume your life with an air of vindication. You are suddenly as much a foreigner as any Peruvian, Indonesian, or Russian. You have no right to visit the US except as a foreigner, using whatever passport you hold from your second country, and having to apply for – and perhaps be refused – a US visa. If a citizen approaches a US consular officer wanting to renounce, all of this will be laid out for him. Those who react with shock and astonishment either storm out in fury, argue, or try to negotiate (ain’t happening). Those who understand and have thought thoroughly about their lives, are welcome to complete the process. As you can figure out from this answer, the majority that I, as a consular officer, have seen are the stormers, arguers and negotiators, who want to make some sort of political point but pay nothing (except money) for it. The minority live fine lives wherever they prefer to live and, if they want to visit the US from time to time, are welcome to either apply for a visa or use the Visa Waiver if their new home country qualifies for that program. Finally, as you can probably imagine by now, if they later change their minds and want to return to live in the US, they must go through the standard immigration process just like any other Peruvian, Indonesian, or Russian.
