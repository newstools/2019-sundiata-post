Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar, has sued President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Assistant on social media, Lauretta Onochie, over an alleged libel and defamation of character. “To say that the claimant is shopping for terrorists knowing same to be untrue and without any foundation is not only dishonest and reckless, but is calculated and politically designed to instigate security agents against him not only in the UAE, but across the world,” He mentioned filing the suit in the statement. Ozekhome (SAN), filed a N2.5bn suit against Onochie before the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in Abuja on June 26 after Onochie failed to apologise to the former VP over a tweet he said was libellous. Media aide to Atiku, Paul Ibe, confirmed the suit to The Guardian. “I know that there was development and I want to believe the process (suit) have been advanced. She (Onochie) was asked to withdraw what she said but she refused,” Ibe said. Onochie drew the ire of Abubakar after accusing him of being on the “watchlist” of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for corruption as well as shopping for terrorists in the Middle East.
