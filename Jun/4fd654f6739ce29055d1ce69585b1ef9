Following the r*pe allegations recently made by Busola Dakolo against Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, many Nigerians have taken to social media to blast the cleric. One of those who attacked the pastor is popular rapper, MI. Tweeting about the matter, MI had written: “If a so called Man of God decides to r*pe Gods children!!! He must be called what he actually is.. a man of Satan!!!!” However, when the The Church of Satan on Twitter saw MI’s tweet, they reacted to his comment. They wrote: “However it’s exclusively men who consider themselves “of God” who try to blame a supernatural enemy for their disgusting actions, and the church covers for them, allowing them to do it time and time again. “Imaginary friends and enemies get us no where.” Source
