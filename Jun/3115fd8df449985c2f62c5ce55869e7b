New Delhi – Indian air force pilots on Monday spotted five bodies on the Himalayan Nanda Devi mountain during their search for a missing team of eight international climbers, officials said.The rescue effort for the group, which includes four Britons, two U.S. citizens, an Australian and an Indian, was launched on Saturday after they did not return to their base camp as scheduled on May 27.“Pilots carrying out helicopter sorties found five bodies in the region that was hit by an avalanche, where the trekkers had reportedly gone missing,’’ said senior administrative official Vijay Kumar Jogdande.“We assume the bodies are from the team that went missing. It is likely that the three remaining bodies would be in the same area,’’ he said.The team was attempting to summit a previously unclimbed peak on the 7,817-metre mountain, officials said, confirming reports of an avalanche in the area.Contact with the team was lost on May 24.“Since the region where the bodies were found is over 5,000 metres which is seeing heavy snowfall and winds, we will not be able to send a team today.“We are seeking a feasibility report and hope to send teams to retrieve the bodies on Tuesday,’’ Jogdande added.The expedition group was being led by experienced British mountain guide Martin Moran, whose company Moran Mountain has run many expeditions in the Indian Himalayas.
