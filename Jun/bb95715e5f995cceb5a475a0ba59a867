He said the gunmen also attacked Unguwar Rimi village killing three teenagers same day before moving to Kikuba village. “They attacked Kikuba around 6:00pm on Monday, a town bordering Kaduna and Plateau state. The town is under Chawai District and about 21 houses were burnt and one person killed during the attack,” he said. He said an elderly man also sustained gunshot injury but added that he is responding to treatment at a hospital because he couldn’t run when the gunmen attacked Kikuba. On why he came to Kaduna he said “I came to meet with the governor and commissioner of police. The commissioner was not in town; so I will wait to see him on how they can assist us.” He said the situation is calm now and under control as security agencies have been deployed to the affected communities. The chief also added that each time there was crisis in Plateau state, it does spread to the area due to proximity.
