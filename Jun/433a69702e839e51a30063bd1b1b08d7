By Peter Amine Jos – The management of Plateau United FC of Jos has decried the illegal production and sale of the outfit’s jerseys, and vowed to arrest and prosecute those involved. The club, in a statement by its Media Officer, Albert Dakub, said that the situation was frustrating the club’s revenue generating efforts. The statement said that the club had engaged the services of security agencies to apprehend those involved, and advised members of the public to be weary of such dubious persons. It advised members of the public, especially the club’s teeming fans, to visit the outfit’s office in Jos, if they wanted the replica jerseys of Plateau Utd FC. Dakub lamented that the saboteurs were printing their names on the club’s jerseys to promote selfish interests, and described such attitude as “shameful and embarrassing”.
