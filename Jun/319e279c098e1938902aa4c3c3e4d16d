By Steve Paul 10 simple things:* Don’t buy (or rent) more house than you need to live* If you buy a car, maintain it and drive it for its useful life. Getting bored with a car is expensive habit. Cost per year is lowest this way.* For things you truly need, buy good quality that will last* Pay cash and don’t live on credit, a house purchase being the exception* Buy used for many things that depreciate fast: Furniture, cars, even second-hand clothes that are almost new can be had for 10–20 cents on the dollar.* Limit meals out to entertainment not merely convenience to avoid preparing own meals* Vacation with friends and family so some expenses can be shared* Consider fees and expenses when you invest. Small leaks sink big ships.* The most expensive vacation is not necessarily the most rewarding. Shared experiences often don’t cost very much, and are the most memorable* Learn to bargain and practice walking away. The buyer almost always has the advantage if you use it. Almost everything is negotiable! Finally, invest in/spend on your fitness and your health! Source: Quora
