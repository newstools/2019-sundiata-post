By Christian Ogbonna Yenagoa – The Organising Committee for the third edition of Gov. Seriake Dickson Football Tournament, known as `Restoration Cup’ has said that 150 teams are expected to participate in the fiesta which holds from June 18 to June 27. The Director of the tournament, Mr Daniel Alabrah, told journalists in Yenagoa on Tuesday that the tournament had generated huge interest among communities, religious organisations, and various institutions across the state. “More than 150 teams had already registered and the request for participation forms has not stopped. We have been inundated with a high request for participation in this year’s competition. “More communities than we had last year have registered for the 2019 edition and we are still receiving requests from teams that want to participate. “We are encouraged by the interest that the Restoration Cup has elicited among communities in the state. We believe it is the result of the successful tournament we had in 2018. So, the interest has soared. “We are compelled to extend the registration deadline to accommodate more teams and communities. Registration and submission of forms will now close on Saturday, June 22,” Alabrah said. The director noted that the organisers would convene a better tournament in the third edition and solicited the support of the private sector and corporate organisations in the state. Alabrah described the tournament as “a veritable sporting tool to discover football talents” to spread the message of peace and unity in the state as well as further the campaign against drug abuse, violence and cultism.
