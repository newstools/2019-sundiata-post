The Super Eagles of Nigeria have qualified for round 16 of 2019 Afcon tournament in Egypt after a 1 – 0 victory over Guinea. The Super Eagles had picked 3 points from first game against Burundi and needed another 3 to advance to the next stage. Kenneth Omeruo’s 73rd minute header was enough for the super Eagles who laboured through the very tough contest with Guinea who needed at least a point to keep hopes alive after picking a point from their last game against Madagascar. The Super Eagles are the first team to qualify for the next round.
