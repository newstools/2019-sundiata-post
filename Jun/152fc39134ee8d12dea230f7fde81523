By John Thiel When China collapses in the near future, which country will be the first one to step on her?
After I stopped laughing about China’s collapse, then considered your question seriously for a … laughed again .. and then, OK not ‘if’ but ‘when’ … I’m sorry if this is a fantasy of yours but it aint gonna happen! But hypothetically, all of the sudden, ‘Designated Survivor’ situation, rednecks with guns trying to take over the country, I’m pretty sure China has enough people who can step up and lead without a new Chairman Mao. Even Egypt when lead by Honsny Mubbareck didn’t collapse when he was finally removed like a cancerous tumor. When the USSR collapsed it was traumatic, but it wasn’t the end of Russia. No other country will take over China in that situation. I think the worst that could happen in your fantasy scenario is that they made a descendent of the Emperor head of state, and even then I’m pretty sure you would have some kind of stable government.
