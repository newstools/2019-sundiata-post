PORT HARCOURT – An airline, Air Peace, on Saturday reportedly overshot the runway and skidded into the bush at the Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa in Rivers State.
The incident, which was said to have happened about 4pm, caused panic among airport officials.
It was gathered that no life was lost and none of the passengers was injured as they left for their various destinations shortly after the incident.
Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, confirmed the incident.
Yakubu said although the Boeing 737-500 aircraft skidded off the runway, the pilot was able to stop the aircraft.
She noted that in spite of the rain, the undercarriage of the aircraft did not sink into the soil.
“All passengers disembarked successfully. There was no casualty,” Yakubu said.
Meanwhile, the Chief Operating Officer of Air Peace, Mrs Oluwatoyin Olajide, attributed the incident to the flooding of the runway.
