The Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba AbdulRasheed Akanbi, has reacted to claims by Sheik Adio that he wants to sleep with his wife. Recall that Adio made the claim during a public confrontation at the last Eid Fitri celebration in Iwo where he exchanged words with the monarch in clear view of the other Muslim faithfuls. Reacting, Oba AbdulRasheed Akanbi took to his social media handle and wrote: “FREEDOM OF SPEECH, IM NOT FAMOUS ENOUGH MAKE ME MORE FAMOUS AROUND THE WORLD Thanks to my friends and so called enemies (I call them uplifters) for making me so famous around the world !!! One day, they will call me Yahoo king… another day, they will call me gay and then just day before I just heard a new one… a gbaruku alfa who is not even an Imam , a 16th position otun ajanasi says” you want to sleep with my wife” The Mosque called Oluwo mosque in Iwo was built by my forefathers a king in the 17th century and happens to be the first mosque in southwest Nigeria but now….OKIKI TI MONI YI OITO EDUMARE, BAMI WA MISI EDUMARE 🤸‍♀️🕺😎🤴🤾‍♀️👑 but guess what This errant man has been deposed and replaced by one of his enemies…. in Iwo kings mosque, only me the Oluwo of Iwoland can turban a chief Imam of the land and our own history in Iwo is different from other towns in Yorubaland, if there is no Oluwo and the Chief Imam pass away …. there won’t be any Chief Imam until another king is crowned and it has happened before when there was a vacuum for the stool for over 10 years(1982-1992) there was no king on seat and nobody can make a chief Imam for the Kings mosque.” Read his reaction below: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bya4fn0gpTt/ Source
