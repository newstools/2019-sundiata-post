Stefflon Don revealed how close she is to her son and said he would always want to show her off in school. More about Burna Boy‘s girlfriend, Stefflon Don’s early life is popping out as we have just learnt she had a child when she was still a teenager. Well, Stefflon Don is a proud mother of one. She gave birth to a boy at age 17 and according to reports she is doing everything to keep her family away from the public and that’s the reason any tip about the boy has not been on the internet before now. Speaking to ES Magazine, Stefflon Don revealed how close she is to her son and said he would always want to show her off in school. “He wants me to drop him at school so he can show me off. I’m like: ‘I’m not doing that.’ So usually I go with my PA and let her walk him in.” The “Hurtin’ Me” star said she attended a play day at his school that was hosted in a local park and things got pretty crazy amongst her son’s friends. “All the kids wanted their picture taken with me,” she admits.
