He submitted that the defendants  debited Onajule’s account afterwards. “The defendants used the complainant’s GTB mobile application to transfer N896,000 into one of their personal accounts without his knowledge,’’ he said. The prosecutor submitted that the complainant saw a debit alert of N896,000 from his account to another account and thereafter went to the bank to find out how it happend.
