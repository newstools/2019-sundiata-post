Shittu is standing trial for conspiracy, obtaining under false pretences, stealing and breach of the peace. She, however, pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, Sgt. Ola Adelowo, told the court that the defendant collected the sum from the complainant, Mrs. Vivian Uzor after hypnotising her. Adelowo said that the defendant committed the offences in April and May, on Jebba Street, Ebute Meta. “She used charms to warn the complainant not to reveal what happened, else she would die,” the prosecutor said. She submitted that the defendant had told the complainant that the money was to enable her to print one million U.S. dollars for her, a representation she knew was false. The alleged offences contravene Sections 168, 287, 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Magistrate, Mrs. Monisola Ayinde, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. Ayinde said the sureties must be gainfully employed. She adjourned the case until July 9 for trial. (News Express)
