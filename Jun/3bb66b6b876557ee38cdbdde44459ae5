A 39-year old housewife, Mrs. Anthonia Ijeoma Ezeala, has asked a Customary Court in Lagos to dissolve her 22-year old marriage with her husband, Ikechukwu, because she was tired of the marriage. According to PM Express, Mrs. Anthonia, a mother of five, told the Court that the last time she got pregnant for her husband that her husbandâ€™s lover was also impregnated by him and they got delivered of babies at the same time. She said apart from that, the husband, Ikechukwu, had turned her into a punching bag and does not provide for the upkeep and education of their children for several years of marriage. The embattled woman, Mrs. Anthonia, told the Court that she was the one paying their house rent yet her husband, Ikechukwu, will not give her peace due to constant beatings to the extent that the owner of their house had to chase them away and they have been living separately for over a year. She said they got married some years ago after they had lived together before he eventually went to her home town in Enugu State to pay her bride price and they had the children as Ikechukwu hails from Umuahia in Abia State. Mrs. Anthonia further told the Court that Ikechukwu lives in a hotel; he does not return home or perform his marital obligation. She said that she was no longer in love with him and wanted the marriage to be dissolved in order for her to have rest of mind. She also requested the Court to grant her the custody of their children and compel Ikechukwu to be paying for the upkeep of the children. The husband, Ikechukwu, did not appear in Court. The President of the Court, Mrs. Angela Benson, then ruled that in the interest of fairness and justice, the husband will be given an opportunity to state his own side of the allegations leveled against him and subsequently adjourned the matter till 6th June, 2019.
