By Solomon Asowata Lagos, – The Murtala Muhammad International Airport (MMIA) Police Command on Thursday said that it prosecuted no fewer than 88 persons in  court for committing various offences between January and April 2019. The spokesman for the command, DSP Joseph Alabi, disclosed this in an interview he granted the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. NAN reports that some of the suspects were charged with assault; stealing, obtaining by false pretenses as well as unlawful entry and touting. These are offences that contravene the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) Bye Laws. Alabi said that the command made 125 arrests and secured 19 convictions within the period. The spokesman said 35 persons were still under investigations while 69 others were awaiting trial. He said the command was committed to making the airport and its environs safe and secure for travellers, airline operators and its other users. Alabi also told NAN that 26 officers from the command were promoted recently. This had further boosted their morale in the discharge of their duties. Alabi said: “It is evident that security has improved at the MMIA. “Those who used to come here for touting and swindling of unsuspecting passengers now know that they will be prosecuted for their actions if caught by the security agencies. “Our plain clothes officers have been deployed in and around the airport’s environment to ensure the safety and security of passengers and other users of the airport. “My advice is that the members of the public should learn how to abide by the rules and regulations of the airport, especially in the restricted areas,” Alabi said.
