By Henry Erastus Yes! Every where in the world their are criminals that is why every country has a police to keep law and order. I have lived in Kampala, Uganda all my life and I am cautious to stay out of trouble. So if you stay out of trouble and you are cautious of your surrounding then Kampala is safe and we are a loving people and we respect foreigners as long as you are not political and you do not oppose the NRM government you will be safe.
