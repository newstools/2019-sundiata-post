Yul Edochie, one of Nigeria’s popular actors, has said he has found his calling after he survived a ghastly accident and he revealed this calling to followers. The actor shared a message he received from a follower telling him her husband gave his life to Christ after hearing of the actor’s accident. He then claimed his new calling is now “to win souls for Christ, spread love and heal the world”. Source
