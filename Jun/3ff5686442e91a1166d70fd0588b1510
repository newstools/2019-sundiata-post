Mercy Aigbe has been verbally battered by a troll after she was caught making moves at new Lagos state Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. This is coming after the actress was allegedly romantically involved with the immediate past Governor of Lagos state, Akinwunmi Ambode. While Ambode was in power, it was alleged that he built the Mansion the actress got in one of the high brow areas of Lagos state. Following his exit from office, Mercy Aigbe is now making moves at the new Lagos state Governor just a few days after he resumed office. She was caught making patronizing posts about the new governor on her page and the governorâ€™s social media page. However, a troll who saw the comments attacked the actress telling her not to bring bad luck to Sanwo-Olu the way she did to Ambode who was not able to get a second term. See posts below: Source
