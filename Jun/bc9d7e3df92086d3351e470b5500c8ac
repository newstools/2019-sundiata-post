According to a report by Daily Trust, a 17-year-old girl, Sadiya Shehu of Tudun Murtala quarters, Nasarawa Local Government Area of Kano State has committed suicide on Monday over a misunderstanding between her parents that led to divorce of her mother. She died as a result of consuming insecticide locally known as pia-pia kept in her mother’s room for the purpose of repelling mosquitoes and other insects. When Daily Trust visited the family house of the deceased, sympathisers were seen trooping to the house to condole the bereaved family. It was observed that the tragedy became a topic of discussion amongst residents of the area, as people could be seen discussing the matter in groups. Speaking to Chronicle, father of the deceased, Malam Shehu A Lawan confirmed that late Sadiya committed suicide as a result of “a minor problem” that happened between him and her mother on Sunday which was later settled that very day. “I had a problem with her mother over which she was not happy. She was crying and I told her that everything was over. “I woke up early and left Sadiya and her siblings hale and hearty but unfortunately, while I was at my place of work, I received a call that she was rushed to hospital. The doctors tried their best to revive her but, as Allah Has decreed, she passed away,” he said. Source
