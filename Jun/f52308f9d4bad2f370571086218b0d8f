Moses Obaje Yenusa, a security man working with one of the new generation banks in Akwa Ibom State, was, on Wednesday evening, swept away by the flood along Grace Bill road, Eket, after a downpour. Moses was said to be returning from where he went to eat, when he slipped and fell inside a flooded gutter. His demise is being mourned by his colleagues, friends and family members. Source
