By Deborah Akpede Ikeja – A 33-year-old truck driver, Rauf Yinusa, was on Thursday in Lagos  charged with theft of  his employer’s 54 bags of chemicals. Yinusa, who resides in Ibadan, is facing a count charge of stealing before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court but he pleaded not guilty. The defendant committed the offence on May 27 at Ilupeju, Lagos, according to the police prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde. Ayorinde said that the defendant stole the 54 bags of chemicals from Mr Raji Mutiu. “The defendant was sent to deliver the goods but on his way he stole 54 bags. “It was later discovered that 54 bags were missing out of the 1,200 bags loaded in the truck. “The defendant could not give any explanation of what happened to the missing bags. “He was handed over to the police,” the prosecutor said. The News Agency of Nigeria  (NAN) reports that stealing from one’s employer  contravenes Section 287 (7) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, and attracts seven years jail term. The Magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, released the defendant on bail in the sum of N200, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Osunsanmi ordered that the sureties should be gainfully employed and have  evidence of two years tax payments to the Lagos State Government. She adjourned the case until Aug. 2 for hearing.
