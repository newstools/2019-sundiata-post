By Anita Eboigbe Abuja, – Nigerian-American filmmaker, Julius Onah examines racism, prejudice and stereotypes in new thought provoking film, ‘Luce’.

While they love him, they still harbour concerns that he might be haunted by the violent trauma of his past as he was a child-soldier in Eritrea. When Luce’s teacher, Harriet (Oscar-winning actress, Octavia Spencer) discovers the well-researched paper he wrote about political violence, she begins to investigate. However, her investigations seems to harbour prejudice and her discoveries set off a chain of events that will change everyone’s lives forever.
