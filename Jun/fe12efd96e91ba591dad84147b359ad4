By Kathryn Berck Yes, more than once (far more than once) in certain places, a local employee would mention to me that a certain visa applicant was wearing or carrying some item that was known as a sort of charm that would inspire another person to do what the holder or wearer wanted. And, of course, it was probably being used to somehow inspire me to issue the holder a visa. Didnâ€™t work, as far as I could tell. I issued some, refused others, but, of course, might have been mesmerized and not noticed. Source: Quora
