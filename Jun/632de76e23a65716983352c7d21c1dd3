By Funmilola Gboteku Lagos – Jumia, an online shopping destination on Tuesday says it has empowered women residents in Lagos to deepen e-Commerce penetration in the country. Mrs Juliet Anammah, the Chief Executive Officer of Jumia Nigeria, made this known in a statement in Lagos. She said that they were able to do this through the company’s Women and Youth Empowerment Programme. Anammah said that the programme was created to provide training and support to young women and youths seeking to expand their sources of income. She noted that the programme which was also aimed at ultimately bridging the widening unemployment gap among the youth in the country, had its pilot phase launched on June 14 at the Jumia Experience Centre in Yaba, Lagos. “When women are empowered, families are also empowered,’’ the Jumia boss said. She also noted that the empowerment programme aligned with the company’s mission of improving the everyday lives of Nigerians. “Mrs Esther Olusanya, a full-time housewife and Mrs Omoboanle Ajala, a local tailor in Agege suburb of Lagos, were among local women who attended the programme. “The two nursing mothers described the initiative as an excellent supplement for women willing to make extra income to support their families while helping others save time and save money on Jumia,’’ Anammah said. Mr Olusegun Martins, Jumia’s Head of Growth and Marketing, said that aside from empowering women, the programme had a long term goal of helping consumers understand how to benefit from online shopping, especially among rural dwellers. “I encourage participants to leverage on the programme to support themselves,’’ Martins said.
