A woman has been arrested for posing as an aide to Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to get visas for some persons at the Italian Embassy. Spokesman of the governor, Gboyega Akosile, said in a statement on Monday night that the woman was arrested during the weekend following intelligence on the usage of the governor’s office for unauthorised purpose. Mr Akosile did not mention the suspect’s name in the statement. He said she sent an e-mail to the Embassy of Italy in Lagos posing as an official of Lagos State Government and sought the country’s visas for some unsuspecting Nigerians. “The embassy however wrote to the Governor’s office to authenticate the claims, which were later found to be false. “The letter from the Italian embassy led to further investigation and her subsequent arrest and interrogation. “Although she denied the allegation claiming that her email was hacked, the Lagos State Governor’s office has sent the matter to the appropriate security agencies for appropriate action,” the statement said. The spokesman said the governor’s office has warned “members of the public not to deal with any persons who parade themselves as government representatives in consular matters.” Source: QED.
