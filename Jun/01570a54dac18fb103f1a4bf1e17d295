After denying that he promised to clear Apapa gridlock within first 60 days in office, a video has surfaced. Lagos Governor, Sanwo-Olu Details have emerged after Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday said that he didn’t make any promise to clear the Apapa gridlock within his first 60 days in office. Sanwo-Olu, while addressing state house correspondents in Abuja after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, said he didn’t make the promise. He rather said that he only promised to review the gridlock situation within 60 days. However, a fact-check has shown that the governor actually promised to end Apapa Wharf gridlock in the first 100 days in office, not 60 days, while speaking during a governorship debate last year which was aired on Channels Television. Many people have said that the governor has shown by this singular act that he is not different from other leaders Nigeria has had who make bogus promises only to deny them when they are voted into power. Watch the video below:
