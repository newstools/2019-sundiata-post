By Edward Lokshin -The Mossad bugged the home of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United Nations in 1978 and discovered that Andrew Young, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was holding talks with PLO officials there. The meeting was highly controversial, since the United States had already promised Israel that it would not meet directly with the PLO until the PLO recognized Israel’s right to exist. The Mossad leaked the information, forcing Young to resign. -A French Mossad agent placed a homing device in the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor, enabling Israel’s precise 1981 bombing of the facility. The agent died in the attack. -In 2017, two helicopters flew a team of commandos and Mossad operatives deep into Syria to gain information on a reported new Isis weapon. They landed some miles from their target and proceeded in vehicles with Syrian Army markings before bugging the Isis cell and getting back out Unit 8200, Israel’s signals intelligence corps, monitored the broadcasts from the bugs for several days before striking gold – an Isis soldier explaining how to create a bomb from a laptop that would fool airport security.
