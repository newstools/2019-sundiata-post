By Christian Beta Lastly, while we as humans are selfish naturally, don’t walk through life with your eyes rolled in, try look outside yourself,see the people around you,they need your help,they need a shoulder sometimes so give it to them. Depression and suicide can be stopped way before they happen if you can see it coming in the first place. With that said. Life doesn’t come with a user manual but try the ten commandments, love more and everything will be OK. Source:Quora
