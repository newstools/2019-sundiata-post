By Toba Ajayi Ilorin – Mr Abdulwahab Saliu, Chairman, National Cashew Association of Nigeria (NCAN) Kwara Branch , has advised businessmen and the Federal Government to tap into cashew potential. Saliu gave the advice while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin on Monday. He advised Nigerians to exploit cashew potential to improve the economy. He said that apart from it being a fruit, many things could be derived from the cashew seed, saying that foreigners were already exploring the potential. “It promotes healthy level of good cholesterol and it is used for stomach and intestinal ailments. “The seed produces oil which is also medicinal and the nut is a nutritious snack. “So, we should not allow all these to waste away. Processing cashew should be a source of income for all,’’ Saliu said. He said that foreigners were already transporting cashew nuts to be processed into different products that will later be imported into the country for us to buy. “I can tell you authoritatively that foreigners move from farm to farm to buy cashew nuts without proper security check. “Cashew nuts serve as a source of income to the country and should not be left in the hands of foreigners alone. “The Federal Government must act fast and halt the domination of cashew farms by foreigners. “Our economy is in danger if we continue to allow foreign influence on our cash crops. “Indians and some Asians see Nigerian cashew farms as free land where they can roam to do whatever they want,’’ he said. Saliu urged the Federal Government to support cashew farmers to generate foreign exchange for the country. “Government needs to do more by giving land and financial supports to encourage farmers,’’ he said.
