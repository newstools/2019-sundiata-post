By Gami Tadanyigbe Kuje – A Kuje Upper Area Court, on Monday sentenced a 29-year-old labourer, Sani Adamu, to three-month imprisonment for stealing a generator, valued at N40, 000. Adamu, who resides at Anguwan Lado area, was sentenced over a two-count charge of criminal trespass and theft. The prosecutor, Samuel Ocheche, told the court that one Bitrus Leda, the complainant, who resides at Sauka area, reported the matter at the police station on June 13. Ocheche said Adamu broke into the complainant’s house during working hours and made away with a generator. According to the prosecutor, the offences contravened Sections 348 and 288 of the Penal Code. When the charges were read to Adamu, he pleaded guilty for committing the crime and begged the court for leniency. The judge, Abdullahi Abdulkareem, however, sentenced the convict to three months imprisonment without any option of fine to serve as deterrent to others with similar intentions.
