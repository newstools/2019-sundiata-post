Although Kanu was happy with the country’s qualification, he feels the margin should have been bigger if Ighalo was not selfish. Former Super Eagles captain, Kanu Nwankwo, has blamed Odion Ighalo for the narrow 1-0 win over Guinea on Wednesday. Nigeria became the first country to qualify for the Round of 16 following victory over the Syli Stars, thanks to Kenneth Omeruo’s header in the second half. Although Kanu was happy with the country’s qualification, he feels the margin should have been bigger if Ighalo was not selfish. “We are more relaxed now after the win over Guinea to advance to the next round. “We had few chances to score more goals in the first half when Odion Ighalo had a good chance to pass the ball to Musa but he did not do so. “Guinea are no pushovers, but we took our chances,” the two-time Africa Player of The Year told CAFOnline. Kanu also refused to predict who will win lift the AFCON title, adding that it’s still early days in the tournament. “I don’t want to predict who will win the tournament now after two games but after the group games then we can see the real teams in contention,” he added.
