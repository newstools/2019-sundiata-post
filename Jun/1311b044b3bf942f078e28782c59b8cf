By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Nigeria Union of Journalists, (NUJ) has given the National Broadcasting Commission, (NBC) 24 hours ultimatum to reopen the African Independent Television (AIT) and its RayPower radio stations. NUJ said that the action of the commission portends grave danger
for Free Press and Independent Media.” Sundiata Post recalls that the NBC on Thursday suspended operations of Daar Communications, owners of AIT and RayPower FM over allegations of breaching Broadcasting Code. The NUJ in a
statement signed by its President, Chris Isiguzo and the National Secretary,
Shuaibu Usman Leman, described NBC actions as unacceptable. The statement
read: “The Nigeria Union of Journalists is alarmed at the closure of
AIT by the National Broadcasting Commission and believes that the action
portends grave danger for Free Press and Independent Media. “Independent
and Pluralistic Media in a democracy like Nigeria serve to promote democracy by
their dissemination of authentic information and ensuring transparency in
governance. “We condemn
this closure over allegations of breach of 2004 Broadcasting Code and insist
there are better ways of sanctioning media organisations that are found to have
erred. “It will be
helpful if the NBC will immediately reopen AIT to ensure that they continue to
promote debate and opinions on issues that are of societal, economic and
political importance to the nation. “We expect
them to do the needful in 24-hours,” the statement read.
