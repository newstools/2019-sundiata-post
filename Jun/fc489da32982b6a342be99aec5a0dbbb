Mumbai – A 23-year-old patient has tested positive for the deadly brain-damaging Nipah virus in India’s southern state of Kerala. Six people, who were in contact with the patient, have also been quarantined as the state government issued high alert on Monday. The state government also opened an emergency control room in Ernakulam, 540 km from Bengaluru, media reports said, quoting State Health Minister KK Shailaja. The patient contracted fever when he went to Thrissur, 77 km from Ernakulam for some training. He was admitted to a private hospital after persistent fever and headache for 10 days. In May 2018, Nipah outbreak claimed 17 lives, including a nurse treating the patients. Nipah virus, spread by fruit bats, causes high fever, headache and coma in extreme cases. Body fluids can cause human-to-human transmission of Nipah, which has a mortality rate of 70 per cent and has no vaccine.
