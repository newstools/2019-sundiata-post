By Folayemi Jedo Osogbo – A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) — Dialogue 365 —has urged youths to desist from drug abuse and other vices that can jeopardise their future. The Convener of the group, Mr Wakeed Saka, made the call at a news conference on Thursday in Osogbo to mark UN International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking,celebrated annually on June 26 since 1989. The observance was instituted by General Assembly Resolution 42/112 of Dec. 7, 1987. Saka said there was urgent need for stakeholders in health sector, as well as government at all levels to continue to sensitise youths on the dangers of drug abuse. He added that it was sad that youths, future leaders of the country, were currently battling with drug abuse related issues. He commended government for the enactment of laws against drug trafficking, addiction and abuse, saying enforcement of such legislation had, however, been the major issue in the fight against drug abuse. He said the campaign of the group was aimed at preventing teenagers from drug abuse by nurturing them through the most vulnerable time of their lives. Saka said the NGO would continue to work with the media and drug enforcement agencyto achieve its purpose of drug-free society. He noted that “in spite of challenges posed by drug abuse among youths, we have no doubt as an organisation that the impact can be mitigated through organised preventive actions. “That is why we are leading the campaign to prevent greater number of younger ones from drug abuse.” (NAN)
