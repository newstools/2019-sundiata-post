By Adenike Ayodele Ikeja – A 38-year-old man, Mayowa Komolafe, who allegedly broke into the office of the Lagos State Health Management Agency and stole five laptops valued at N1.8 million,  on Thursday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court. Komolafe, a resident of No. 20,  Irepodun St., Alakuko in Lagos State, was arraigned on a three-count-charge of conspiracy, stealing and housebreaking. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecutor, ASP Akeem Raji, alleged that the defendant stole five brand new HP laptops from the agency on May 25 at 1.00 p.m. at No 17/19 Olaiya St., Ikeja. Raji told the court that the defendant committed the offences with others still at large. He said the defendant was later caught roaming aimlessly around the office premises and handed over to the police. “All attempts made to retrieve the stolen laptops proved abortive,” the prosecutor submitted. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs O.A. Layinka, granted the defendant N100,000 bail with two sureties in like sum. Layinka ruled that the sureties must be gainfully employed and have evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She  adjourned the case until June 26 for hearing. The alleged offences violate Section 287, 309 and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015, (Revised). NAN reports that stealing is punishable with three years jail term while conspiracy and housebreaking attract  two years imprisonment each.
