Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Executive Secretary Zamfara state Emergency Management Agency, Eng. Sunusi Muhammad Kwatarkwashi, The Nation reporter in Zamfara state, Sani Muhammad Sani and NEMA officials escaped kidnapping at the weekend on their way to supervise distribution of relief materials to Internally Displaced Persons(IDPs) in Kanoma community of Maru local government. The kidnappers lay unsuccessful ambush along the pot holes road leading to the heart of Kanoma where the vehicle carrying the relief items was already on location. Kwatarkwashi explained the bandits were informed of their coming after noticing the arrival of the first vehicle. The bandits were first spotted by the Director Relief Distribution of ZEMA, Alhaji Aminu Muhammad Anka some 15 metres away with sophisticated guns. About five of them hid behind the trees while two others camouflaged as members of the vigilance team. The team’s vehicle quickly made a U- turn but a motorcyclist came after them, claiming the people hiding behind the trees sent him to allay their fears. He said the arm-bearing men were hunters while another two persons appeared from another direction, declaring the gunmen were hunters. But the team refused to stop, making a quick detour out of the community as Kwatarkwashi insisted Zamfara state has no hunters and Kanoma community is one of the operational bases of the bandits.
