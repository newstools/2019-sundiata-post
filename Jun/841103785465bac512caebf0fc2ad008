Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara state, is on his way to Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), for a meeting to “discuss ways of tackling the problem of banditry” in the state. Yusuf Idris, the director-general, government house press affairs, disclosed this in a statement. He said the governor, who travelled on Sunday to perform the lesser hajj in Saudi Arabia, would stop over in Dubai to meet with security experts to seek advice. He said Matawalle will also discuss with officials of Saudi Arabian government towards the release of Alaramma Ibrahim, a Zamfara-born in detention for almost two years, over alleged drugs trafficking. “The governor will meet with security experts in Dubai and share ideas on the best way to end the menace of armed banditry in the state,” the statement read. “He is also expected to meet with the officials of Saudi Arabian government to discuss ways towards the release of the Zamfara-born Alaramma Ibrahim, who has been in detention for almost two years, over alleged drugs trafficking. “From our findings, his arrest followed a frame-up initiated from the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano. “While in Dubai, the governor will also meet with officials of African Development Bank (ADB), and some investors interested in investing into the Zamfara economy.” Matawalle’s trip to Dubai comes after Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun, stopped 68 council chairman in the state from their proposed 10-day trip to study democracy in Dubai, which practises the monarchical system of government. The cancelled, which was all-expense paid, was approved by the previous administration in the state. Cable.
