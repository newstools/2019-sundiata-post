By Charles Cavalieri I was courting my wife to be and things were going fine. She worked in a bank and very serious about her job: was courteous and polite to all customers. One day she told me that a young man was flirting with her and she did not want to see him socially. He continued flirting and getting nowhere. One evening I was with her brother in the local bar. There was a loud commotion and someone was on the floor with some bruising, it seemed that he got into an altercation. He advised his opponent that he knew karate. Before he could assume the stance, his opponent clocked him with a roundhouse: he was decked. My girlfriend’s brother asked me if I knew the guy and I replied “no”. He informed me that he was the guy who was giving his sister a hard time. I am thinking about this and considerig my next move. I went over to him, helped him up and offered to take him to my place and get cleaned up. He accepted, After he was refreshed, I asked him if the fight was about a woman. He replied, “yes”. This presented me with an opportunity, not to get into a fight with him, but rather, get him to thinking. I took out a picture of my girlfriend, put my arm around his shoulder and explained that some wise guy was bothering her and that I wished I could get my hands on him for just a little while. I dropped him off at his car and wished him well. Funny thing, I never saw him again nor did my girlfriend. I felt good about doing a good deed. Source:Quora
