Some protesters under the platform of #ChurchTooMovement have vowed to storm the headquarters of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA) in Abuja on Sunday. This was contained in a notice widely circulated on social media. “If you are outraged by the alleged sexual abuses perpetrated by pastors and so-called ‘men of God’, join us for protest March to COZA church. Meeting point: NNPC filling station, Guzape. Sunday June 30, 2019 8:00am. Dress code: White top,” it read. This is coming after Busola Dakolo, celebrity photographer and wife of Timi Dakolo, levelled allegation of rape against Biodun Fatoyinbo, founder of COZA. The accusation generated a lot reactions, particularly on social media. Fatoyimbo has since denied the allegation. This is not the first time the pastor would be accused of rape. In 2013, one Ese Walter, a member of his church accused him of molesting her. Fatoyinbo had also denied the allegation, attributing it to his enemies. Source
