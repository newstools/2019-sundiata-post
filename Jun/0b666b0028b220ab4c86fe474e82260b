By Fidelis Omokhordion Edo – The Police Headquarters Abuja , has directed the removal of the Chief Security Officer, CSO, to the governor of Edo state, Governor Godwin Obaseki, DSP Chris NWOKOLO from Edo State Government House. This is as a result of the alleged role DSP Chris played in leading the Police to give backup to the gang of over one thousand thugs that stormed the premises of Golden Tulips Hotel located in Etete, GRA Benin, to harass, humiliate and steal properties of some honourable members elect of the Edo state House of Assembly, where two members elected recounted their ordeals in the hands of Governor Obaseki men when they were kidnapped and forced to join in the nocturnal kangaroo inauguration that came up in the state recently. The thugs, backed by the Wabaizigan, police squad, also vandalized several properties belonging to the hotel, under the watch and supervision of the police, in the process of carrying out their criminal activities. It could be recalled that same Wabaizigan Police squad led thugs to secure the complex of the EDO STATE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY to ensure that only nine members elect, were allowed into, or seen within the vicinity of the House of Assembly on the night of the infamous inauguration. Our source, a Police inspector, also serving at the government House in Benin, said: ‘…it is a good thing that the other members elect stayed away from the House of Assembly complex on the night of the inauguration, who knows, Chris may have been given the instruction to shoot them at sight…the present governor and his cabal, are viciously desperate for only God knows why…’ As a result of this development, our source added, The state governor organised a Prayer meeting at the government House today asking God for intervention as it is suspected that more heads are likely to roll.
