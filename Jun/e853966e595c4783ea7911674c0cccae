Five ‘notorious’ rustlers arrested by Police in Plateau State have claimed working with an Operative of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). Mr. Mohammed Isah, Mr. Badung Dalyop, Mr. Sanu Mohammed, Mr. Mohammed Salisu and Mr. Abdullahi Idris were arrested on June 6, 2019 by SARS operatives. They were arrested at midnight while trying to ‘escape’ with seven ‘stolen’ cattle, loaded on a bus, Plateau State Police Commissioner, Mr. Isaac Akinmoyede told journalists in Jos last week Thursday. “The suspects during investigation confessed to have rustled the cattle from Binchim village in Bassa LGA of Plateau State,” said Mr. Akinmoyede. The suspects however exclusively told MKNews that they partnered with a SARS Operative to commit the crime. They identified their partner as one Scooter, who allegedly guided them through security checkpoints during the act. “He was the one giving us cover and telling us where to follow to avoid securities. “He was also the one making contacts for a buyer for us but he was freed after the arrest,” one of them said. They however could not say if they were sure he was not spying on them. The suspects currently in custody are expected to be charged to court soon.
