By Nilshita Kulkarni  My saving in India, by Indian standards were decent, however when I landed here, I was in a shock! The cost of living is very high! So, if you plan to land here, be prepared to do some survival jobs till you get a job in your field. I worked as a cashier in one of the malls. It was a decent paying job. In fact, converting to rupees, I am sure that even my manager did not have that salary ðŸ˜› In conclusion: Accept that cost of living are high. Take up a survival job till you get something decent. Donâ€™t rely solely on your savings! Here are rough cost of living All figures in CA$ and for a month: 1000 â€“ 1400 : Rental / housing in a basement/outskirts 400 â€“ 500 : Car loan installment 250 â€“ 300 : Car insurance 200 â€“ 250 : fuel 500 â€“ 600 : Groceries / eatables 100 â€“ 200 : Internet Overall it takes about 2450 to 3250 per month This varies to an extent from person to person.  If you rely on public transport, then the car factor can be reduced to 600 per month, since one ticket on local train costs CA$10. Source: Quora
