Delta Central Senator, Ovie Omo-Agege, has emerged Deputy President of the Nigerian Senate. Mr Omo-Agege is still enmeshed in an allegation of aiding the invasion of the Senate chamber in 2018. He was alleged to have led thugs to the chamber to steal the mace. Police say they found the mace at the Abuja City Gate a day after it was stolen. Even though a Senate committee prescribed sanctions, Mr Omo-Agege has not been punished for the offence. On Tuesday, he defeated immediate past Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu. Mr Omo-Agege polled 68 votes while Mr Ekweremadu garnered 37. There was one void vote. Meanwhile, Nigerians are reacting on social media, given that Omo Agege was endorsed, in spite of his record, by APCâ€™s leadership. See reactions below:
