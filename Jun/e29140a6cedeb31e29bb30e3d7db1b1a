By Glory Abuh-Adejoh Abuja – The police, on Thursday, arraigned two security guards, Alfred Maisama and Nuhu Wugah in a Wuse Zone 6 Chief Magistrates’ Court, Abuja, over negligent conduct. Both guards of Zan Security Ltd., Abuja, were docked on a one-count charge bordering on negligent conduct. The prosecutor, Fidelis Ogbobe, told the court that the matter was reported by Emmanuel Maluze of Suite A66/70, Efab Mall, Area 11, Garki, Abuja, at Garki Police Station, Abuja, on June 16. Ogbobe said that both men, seconded to the mall where the complainant’s office was situated, were both on duty when yet to be identified persons broke into Maluze’s office. He added that the defendants, “out of negligence and failure to perform their duties diligently, led to the complainant’s suffering loss of his items. “They deliberately neglected their duty posts, thereby paving way for thieves to have access to the complainant’s office.” The prosecutor said that the thieves made  away with N300,000 cash and one HP Laptop valued at N150,000. He said that the defendants could not give satisfactory account of the missing items during police investigation, an offence he said contravened Section 196 of the Penal Code. However, the defendants pleaded not guilty and their counsel, John Abah, made an oral application for their bail, citing sections 35 (4) and 36 (5) of the 1999 Constitution (as ammended). Abah also cited sections 158, 162 and 165 (2) of the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act. The Magistrate, Abdulmajid Oniyangi, then granted bail to the defendants in the sum of N200,000 each and one reliable surety each in like sum. Oniyangi said the sureties must reside within the jurisdiction of the court and adjournedthe matter until July 22 for hearing. (NAN)
