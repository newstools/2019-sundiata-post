A middle-aged man simply identified as Mr Fakorede Olabisi Johnson has been arrested for forging a letterhead of the office of Chief Press Secretary to Oyo State Governor, Mr Taiwo Adisa. The culprit had claimed in the forged letterhead that he was appointed the Acting Coordinating Secretary of the Local Government Civil Service Commission. Fakorede, who was caught in Ibadan on Tuesday afternoon, confessed during interrogation that he engaged in the act because he had always wished to be offered political appointment. The Oyo Town indigene also revealed that though he lives in Lagos, he sometimes visit Ibadan, Oyo State. Asked about what lured him into such action, he said “it was out of ignorance.” According to him: “I printed the letter myself because I like political appointment and I designed the letter in that form. I listen to news and that was how I heard about the name I used.” Fakorede also admitted that he had his Higher National Diploma HND in The Polytechnic of Ibadan, in 2007. However, he did not give details as to whether or not he was sent by some elements to perpetrate the act.
