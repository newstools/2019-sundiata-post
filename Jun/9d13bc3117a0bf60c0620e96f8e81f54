“The technical experts who get sent to us, dare I say, are in fact generally not “technical”. However, a combination of them using the right words, and the lack of technical expertise within our own governments is why most of the aid money gets spent back externally on human expertise as consultants instead of building the institutions. It is also why no actual human capacity is built locally even though this is always a stated goal in these engagements.” —David Moinina Sengeh, Chief Innovation Officer of the Sierra Leonean Government, on the dangers and damages of Africa’s “‘expert’ consulting complex.” Brilliant critique of a huge problem. There is the Mercy Industrial Complex, as my late friend, Professor Pius Adesanmi, calls it. There is the Peace-building Industrial Complex, which does anything but peace-building. And there is the Foreign ‘Expert’ Consulting Complex. Together, they hold Africa down and stymie its development. Source: Facebook
