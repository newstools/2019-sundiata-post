By Justina Auta Abuja. -. The National Council of Women Societies,(NCWS) on Sunday solicited the support of wealthy Nigerians to uplift indigent widows and widowers in Nigeria. Mrs Gloria Shoda, the National President of NCWS told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, that comfortable people should assist the widows and widowers, especially the indigent among them in the country to better their lives. “As we mark the 2019 International Widows` Day, multinationals, wealth people in the society should give helping hands to the widows. “We know that government alone cannot assist the widows and widowers, so I am calling on everyone to do the little that they can to help elevate their suffering. “The council is involved in training and retraining of widows in different skills and we also ensure that they get soft loans to establish and sustain their businesses. “We want to touch more widows, that is why as a council, we call on people to gather the widows and train them on skills that will better their lives and that of their children. “We also have widows that are comfortable and have been helping other widows. I congratulate them and urge them to continue in the good work, she said. NAN reports that International Widows` Day is a global awareness day observed on June 23 annually. The Day was launched by the United Nations in 2010 to raise awareness of the violation of human rights that widows suffer in many countries, following the death of their spouses.
