By Tukur MuntariKano. -. The All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) in Kano State has procured 30 tractors for hiring to farmers across the state to boost food production.The state AFAN Chairman, Alhaji Faruk Rabi’u, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kano on Thursday that the tractors were procured from India to enhance the state’s mechanised farming programme.According to him, the association found it necessary to introduce mechanised farming in order to shift from the traditional farming system for improved agricultural production.He said interested farmers could hire the tractors from the committee set up by the association for the purpose.“Farmers who wish to use the tractors will go to the bank and pay into the association’s account for the number of days they want the tractors to work for them.“This will enable the committee to release the tractors to the farmers for the number of days they want to hire them,” he said.Rabi’u said that the tractor hiring service which commenced this planting season had been hugely successful as it had reduced the amount of money farmers paid labourers to plough their farms.He noted that a farmer who used to spend N30, 000 to plough his farm would now pay only N6, 000 to plough the same farm with a tractor.The AFAN chairman said the committee had a system of monitoring the location of the tractors to ensure that none went beyond the state.He said the association had planned to procure additional tractors to enable more farmers to benefit from the scheme.Rabi’u commended the Kano State Government for paying 25 per cent equity contribution to the company from which the tractors were procured.“The Kano State Government paid the equity contribution amounting to N132 million which was supposed to be paid by the association,” he said.
