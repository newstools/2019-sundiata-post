By Nifemi Sola-Ojo It’s funny and really cool how we Nigerians can insult our country all day but will lose our cool if a non-Nigerian does the same. If you (non-Nigerians) by any chance attempt to insult Nigeria on social media, especially on Twitter, you will be up against a united front of Young Nigerians. Reminds me of my rift with my then social media Ghanaian girlfriend. We were almost in love and one day, I decided to really be old fashioned, so, I wrote and posted her a handwritten letter and I used the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST). Well, she didn’t get the letter and she finally asked me to check with NIPOST whether something went wrong. Just like that, I lost it. Don’t judge my temper, I was fairly young and mostly unreasonable then. I replied, “how about you check with your country’s postal service? My country’s postal service is just fine”. Before you know it, a very heated argument started. She was mentioning; how incompetent and corrupt my county is/was… Our erratic power supply, the atrocities Nigerian troops committed in Liberia, the Boko Haram insurgency etc. our irresponsible presidents Her statements didn’t sit well with me. I responded and I wasn’t nice. I’m not proud of the things I said, so I won’t be writing them here again. I defended my country blindly that day to the extent that I was willing to lose a potential love of my life for the sake of my country. Considering the way Nigerians get so defensive when non-nigerians states the negative obvious about the country to our faces, you’d think Nigerian must be a country full of young patriots right? Well, think again. I spoke about some great things my country have done that day; Our contributions in ECOMOG Our role is the liberation of South Africa from Apartheid Our world-class entertainment industry Our supposed military strength (the reputation of the Nigeian military hasn’t been totally shredded at that time ).
