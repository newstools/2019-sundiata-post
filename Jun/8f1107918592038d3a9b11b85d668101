Barely days after the head of Catholic church, Pope Francis, approved changes to the Lord’s Prayer, Christians from across the world have come out to express their views with quite a large number disagreeing with the pontiff. The line in the prayer that reads “and lead us not into temptation” was reworded to read “do not let us fall into temptation.” The prayer, famously known as “Our Father” was adopted from the Bible’s gospel of Matthew 6:9-15 and it was taught to the disciples by Jesus of Nazareth. Many have come out arguing, the pope was literally editing the Bible which is contrary to provisions of Proverbs 30:5-6. “Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Do not add to his words,or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar,” reads the Bible In his argument, the Pontiff who spoke during an interview with an Italian Catholic TV channel in 2017, said the reworded line implied that God leads human beings into sin which is not the case.“It is not a good translation because it speaks of a God who induces temptation…I am the one who falls. It’s not him pushing me into temptation to then see how I have fallen…A father doesn’t do that; a father helps you to get up immediately. It’s Satan who leads us into temptation – that’s his department,” said Pope Francis. Other Christians have stood in solidarity with the Pope saying the changes were long overdue. Some say, in Matthew 4.1 Jesus was tempted by the devil and,therefore, the Pope was right in editing prayer.
