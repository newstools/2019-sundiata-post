By Rick Bruno I’m 62. (Or, as I am now more comfortable writing it, LXII.) Here is what I’ve come to believe about things not to believe. You don’t know all about life when you are 18. You also don’t know all about life when you are 24, 32, 40, 43, 49, 52, 55 or (so far) LXII. This came as a surprise to me. You learn some stuff by trial and error, but there will always be something to learn about how it works. Don’t believe what someone else believes just because someone else believes it. Even if someone who is an “authority” believes it. Your own truths are just as valid. Don’t believe that money means happiness. Pretty simple, but I was shocked at how many affluent family domestics I was sent to, and the horrible things they said to each other. Don’t believe it’s too late. If you are reading this, it’s not too late. It’s not too late to get that degree. Run that marathon. Take that trip. It’s not too late to mend a friendship. It’s not too late to forgive. It’s not too late for Cheerios. Don’t believe losing is permanent. Look at the Cubs. Don’t believe you suck, are dumb, are worthless, are stupid, are too fat, are too thin, are too old, are too young, are too tired, are too weak. You are none of those things unless you make the mistake of believing what people who think that say about you. This is YOUR life. It’s the only one you get. It is PRECIOUS, and time is your greatest gift. You will run out of it one day. THAT you can believe. Don’t believe you are alone. Don’t believe no one is watching. Don’t believe no one is listening. This is true whether you view it in a spiritual sense or not. People are noticing you, even if you are a mere glance in a crowd. Don’t believe commercials. They are all BS. Edit: One more thing. If you get an email from a high ranking official from a foreign country who is trying to give you millions of dollars because he thinks you will use it wisely, don’t believe it. And neither should he. Source: Quora
