By Gordon Miller Yes, yes they do. There are lots of advantages to having vast sums of money in the bank. I have found that anything over $100,000 gets the attention of the banks marketing department and they will call you to make sure you know there are other things you can do with that money, usually, they all include fees where the bank makes money too. Anything over $250,000 and the local branch manager goes out of his way to do anything for you. I have even had bank personnel offer to pick up and drop off transactions for me so I didnâ€™t have to leave the office. Anything over $500,000 and they simply lose their fucking minds. It usually gets the attention of the regional bank manager and they will show up at your doorstep begging to do anything you want up to and including picking up your dry cleaning. They will also typically offer you $1M-$2M in credit against the $500,000. Source:Quora
