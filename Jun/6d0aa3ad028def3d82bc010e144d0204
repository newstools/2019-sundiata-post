(Sundiata Post) – Gombe State Governor, 
Alhaji Inuwa Yahaya and his counterparts from the 35 states of the
federation on Wednesday engaged the World Bank, Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation and other development partners in areas and ways of  strengthening cooperation and mutual
partnerships for sustainable development results in their respective states. The
interactive session, which took place in Abuja at the instance of the Nigerian
Governor’s Forum, chaired by Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state, centred on new
development challenges, human capital development agenda, financial inclusion,
revenue prioritization among others. The Senior
Special Assistant (Media and Publicity) to the Gombe State Governor, Ismaila
Uba Misilli disclosed this in a statement sent to Sundiata Post. The meeting
also discussed matters relating to health, education, agriculture and
governance, with Country Directors of various agencies taking turns to brief
the states chief executives and answered questions on the partnerships and
rules of engagement. A Special
briefing session was held for Gombe state and seven others by the GAVI  Vaccine Alliance in collaboration with the
National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, 
where the global body reiterated its commitment to providing increased
access to immunization in Gombe, Kebbi, Zamfara, Katsina, Bayelsa,  Jigawa, Niger and Taraba states. In his quest
to take maximum advantage of the forum, Governor Inuwa Yahaya personally
engaged some agencies on the sidelines of the meeting, where he expressed his
administration’s readiness and commitment to partner with them in areas of
mutual interests. Sundiata Post  recalls that the Governor had fortnight ago
met with State Coordinators of Donor Agencies and Development Partners
operating in Gombe State, where he vowed to explore and exploit more areas of
partnerships with them as well as ensure timely counterpart funding of projects
that have direct bearing on the people.
