He said that the bank would continue to leverage its digital offerings to facilitate a seamlessly connected Africa. The managing director also said the bank, through its products called EcobankPay and the Ecobank Xpress ecosystem, would remain in the forefront as key enablers of digital payments across the continent. “As part of the partnership, Ecobank handed over the sum of N.5 million to the best dressed person at the premiere, being the climax of the ‘Eko for Show’ dress code for the event. “EcobankPay, the lifestyle digital payment and collections service of Ecobank Nigeria, has been designated the  payment solution for the premiere of the much anticipated movie,” he said.
