MY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE EUROPEAN ELECTION OBSERVATION REPORT How can arms wielding thugs take over polling stations, intimidating voters and threatening observers and journalists and then INEC would shamelessly call the outcome free and fair? The gubernatorial re-run election in Kano State was a travesty of democracy and celebrating it as “free and fair election” clearly shows that the love of power is greater than the commitment to electoral integrity. Shame! Source: Facebook
