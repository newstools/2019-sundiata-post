The same people who blamed GEJ each time Boko Haram struck are the same ones now asking for patience when Boko Haram strikes under Buhari. The same people who protested when GEJ named University of Lagos after Abiola are the same people applauding Buhari for naming a dilapidated stadium after Abiola. The same people who accused Jonathan of corruption for fuel subsidy of ₦600 billion are saying it is not Buhari’s fault when his fuel subsidy is double the cost at ₦1 trillion. The same people who accused Jonathan of tribalism for appointing just an Ijaw man as NSA are the same men rationalising why the entire 10 intelligence and law enforcement agencies in Nigeria, along with the heads of the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary are headed by Northern Muslim men. You see, the greatest problem of Nigeria is HYPOCRISY, not CORRUPTION #NigerianHypocrisy Source: Facebook
