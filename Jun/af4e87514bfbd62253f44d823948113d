He said that in 2017, Edo had the second highest prevalence of drug use of 15. 5 per cent in the South-South, after Delta which had a prevalence of 18 per cent. He said that the committee was also working to reduce drug use by promoting drug prevention, social inclusion and protection. ”We will be involved in advocacy visits to schools, religious and traditional places and want parents to teach their children the consequences of drug consumption. He said this year’s theme which is “Health for Justice, Justice for Health” highlights the need for inclusive and accountable institutions of criminal justice, health and social services to work hand in hand to provide integrated solutions. Osifo added that activities to mark the day in the state include: campaign to mosques, churches and a public presentation of two books : A Dance Against Taboo and The Last Syndicate.
