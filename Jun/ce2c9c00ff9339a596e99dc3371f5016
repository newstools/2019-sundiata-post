By Chinenye Offor\ Abuja – Dr Ejike Orji, Chairman, Association for the Advancement of Family Planning, on Friday called on the Federal Government to invest in the Nigerian Midwives Service Scheme (MSS) to help reduce maternal mortality. He made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Abuja. According to him, having trained midwives in the rural areas would help reduce deaths of women and girls. Orji said that most maternal deaths occurred due to unsafe abortions that could be avoided if there are adequate trained midwives. He also said that provision of family planning and post-abortion planning for rural women by midwives would help reduce the rate of deaths. “Investing in the scheme is key in the reduction of maternal mortality,’’ he said. According to him, it is imperative for government to increase the budget line policies that will drive change in sexual and reproductive health. Orji further advised that women should be informed and also be given the opportunity to make a healthy choice when it comes to reproductive health. “Only a woman should have the autonomy on how to choose in terms of family planning. “She should be counselled and allowed to decide on what method she wants,” he said. Orji noted that having primary health care under one umbrella is also another measure in ensuring the advancement of health of women and girls in the society are sustained.
