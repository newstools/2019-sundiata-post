Nairobi – Tanzania’s central bank says it has cut the proportion of deposits banks are required to maintain as reserves to seven per cent from eight per cent, in order to boost lending. The apex bank said that the cut takes effect from July 1. The East African nation does not set interest rates conventionally using a benchmark. It uses the statutory minimum reserve requirement to influence private sector credit growth.
