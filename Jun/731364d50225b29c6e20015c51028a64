Thirty people were killed in a triple suicide bombing attributed to Boko Haram jihadists in northeast Nigeria late Sunday, emergency services quoted by AFP reported. “The death toll from the attack has so far increased to 30. We have over 40 people injured,” the news agency quoted Usman Kachalla, head of operations at the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), as saying on Monday, raising the tally from 17 dead and 17 wounded. Three bombers detonated their explosives outside a hall in Konduga, 38 kilometres (24 miles) from the Borno State capital Maiduguri, where football fans were watching a match on TV, the report said.
