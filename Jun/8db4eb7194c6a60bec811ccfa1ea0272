By Mary Bennett I am 63 and I am not elderly. I am getting older and I feel a lot different in the mornings. Once I am up and get going I feel great! I have been around nursing homes all of my life. Iâ€™ve known many people between ages 95 and 103. They were elderly, up to that age is still just aging! Source: Quora
