The Oluwo of Iwoland Oba AbdulRasheed Akanbi has been enmeshed in yet another controversy after he was publicly confronted by Sheikh Adio at the last Eid Fitri celebration in Iwo. Sheikh Ado accused the monarch of trying to sleep with his wife. Sheikh Adio who was supposed to lead prayers at the event, got into a heated exchange and eventually confronted the Oluwo of Iwoland after the monarch told worshippers present to ignore the cleric and go to another Mosque for prayers. Firing back at the Osun monarch, Sheikh Adio stated that the Oluwo of Iwoland who wanted to sleep with his wife, was fighting him because he refused.
