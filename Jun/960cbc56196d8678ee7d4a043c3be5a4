They are probably hurting the most.. *** Finally, a post that isint about sleeping with sum1 friend or some other wild off the wall shit… but be there for your roommate…. and try and comfort them as best as possible *** Just keep in mind, there are 36 states that won’t relieve a duped father of child support even if he can prove it’s not his. Getting a dna test without consent of the mother can result in prosecution *** The family court system in the west is heavily anti-male. The objective is to keep up/maintain the lifestyle of the woman. Kinda like when a woman divorce rapes her husband and takes half his shit, or more
