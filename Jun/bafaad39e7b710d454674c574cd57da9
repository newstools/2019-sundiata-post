There has not been a single sporting event in Abuja stadium in over FIVE years now. Totally decrepit edifice. Completely abandoned. Overgrown with weeds. Facilities fast depreciating and ageing. Hope the place gets a facelift and complete overhaul now now that it has been renamed after the late business mogul and politician. The aim of naming a monument or facility after someone is to keep the name alive any time that facility is being put to use. Any time you land in Abuja airport, the name of Nnamdi Azikiwe, the Owelle of Onitsha, comes to mind and to life. Same applicable to Lagos and Kano airports with the names Murtala Mohammed and Aminu Kano, respectively, coming to mind. When you land in Owerri airport, the name of Samuel Onunaka Mbakwe comes to mind. When you drive on Akin Adesola Way on Victoria Island, the name is remembered. When you ply Mobolaji Bank-Anthony Way in Ikeja, you remember that legend. Now, if the Abuja stadium remains as it is in the last five years: NO ATTENTION, NO FACELIFT, NO RENOVATION, NO PUTTING INTO USE, it means the stadium has NOT been RENAMED. MKO Abiola has only been RE-MOCKED! Let the clappers get that into their skullsâ€¦
