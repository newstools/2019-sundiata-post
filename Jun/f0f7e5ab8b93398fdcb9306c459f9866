By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) met on Thursday and nominated the senator representing Abia South, and former Deputy Governor of Abia State Enyinnaya Abaribe, as Minority Leader in the Ninth Senate. The NWC meeting was held in the Maitama, Abuja home of PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus. Others tipped for positions are: Senator Emmanuel Bwacha (Taraba South) as Deputy Minority Leader; Senator Philip Aduda (FCT) as Minority Whip and Senator Clifford Ordia (Edo Central) as Deputy Minority Whip. Sundiata Post gathered that the NWC will continue the meeting today to meet with PDP members in the House of Representatives to fill the minority offices. But the PDP may have to concede some of the offices in the Green Chamber to other parties that won seats into the House of Representatives, unlike the Senate that is made of only three parties â€“ All Progressives Congress (APC), PDP and Youth Progressives Party (YPP).
