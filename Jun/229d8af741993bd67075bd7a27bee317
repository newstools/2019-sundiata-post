By Justina Auta Abuja – Empire star, Bryshere Gray, who portrays the youngest Lyon brother Hakeem has been booked in Chicago over driving related offences. Authorities initially discovered the tags to the vehicle didn’t match, and later found out that Gray was without a licence or insurance. TMZ said Bryshere was booked on a misdemeanor for registration that ‘was not authorised on the vehicle  and released, as well as cited for not having a license or insurance. This latest development is coming a few months after another ‘Empire’ star, Jussie Smollett, who play brother to Gray was arrested for allegedly planning his own attack. Jussie Smollett was arrested and charged with lying to cops over what they say was a fake attack. The prosecutor later dropped the case. “Empire” is now in its last season. Fox has canceled the run after that, and co-creator Lee Daniels blames it on Jussie.
