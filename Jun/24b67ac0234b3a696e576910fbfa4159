By Adenike Ayodele Ikeja – A 36-year-old sales representative, Emeka Nwaegbu, who allegedly stole his employer’s unregistered Highlander Jeep valued at N4 million on Tuesday appeared in an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court. The defendant, whose residential address was not provided, is charged with theft. The Prosecution Counsel, ASP Akeem Raji, told the court that the defendant absconded with the Jeep worth N4 million, property of Jecmec International Ltd. Raji told the court that the defendant committed the offence in December 2018 at No. 24 Balogun Akaraku St., Bucknor, Ejigbo, Lagos. “All efforts to recover the Jeep from the defendant was futile as he claimed to have sold the jeep and diverted the money to  his personal use,” he alleged. The offence, she added, contravenes the provisions of Section 287 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015, (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that stealing from an employer stipulates seven years imprisonment if found convicted. He pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs O.A. Layinka, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of  N200,000  with two sureties in like sum. Layinka ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed with an evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government and have their addresses verified by the court. She ordered that the sureties must be related to the defendant by blood and reside within the court’s jurisdiction. The Magistrate adjourned the case until June 24 for hearing.
