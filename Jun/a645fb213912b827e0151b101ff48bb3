Nollywood actress Stella Damasus has hinted about another rape victim of Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of the Commonwealth of Zion Academy(COZA). In a tweet posted Friday night, Stella mentioned the story of an unidentified lady she has known for 15 years, who also shared her rape experience with Fatoyinbo. “I am in tears right now. Just got off the phone with someone I have known for 15 years. She had the same experience with this same pastor. The details of her experience were so shocking. She told people around him, but they all suppressed it. Are people still doubting this incident?”, Stella who is now based in New York wrote. In another tweet, and against denial of raping Busola Dakolo, Stella again wrote: ”Some people have mastered the art of manipulation and brainwashing. It’s not easy to break free from that. God help and heal us”. Busola’s story has shocked Nigerians and the hordes of celebrities, with Fatoyinbo having to come out Friday night to deny ever raping any woman, ‘even when he was an unbeliever’. He has also threatened legal action, against Busola. Source
