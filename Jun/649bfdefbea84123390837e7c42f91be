Social media users have risen up in arms against COZA Pastor Biodun Fatoyimbo over multiple rape allegations. The latest being that of Busola Dakolo, wife of popular Nigerian singer, Timi Dakolo, who revealed in a video that she was raped at 17 by Pastor Biodun Fatoyimbo. This has generated a lot of debate on social media and alot of users are mobilising for a protest. I’m giving Pastor Biodun 24 hours to reply,apologise and also face the law or else I might just fuck around on Sunday and go to COZA with placards saying RAPIST . Those of us in Abuja should come together and do this,but even if no one joins me I will quietly hold up my placard inside the church till the ushers carry me out. See the rallying message below: “In light of the numerous accusations against Biodun Fatoyinbo of COZA, it will be great to organize a protest around/within the COZA premises. The protest is aimed at the church supporting & protecting rapists, slut & victim-shaming of members of their own congregation. 
Everything being done to women that have spoken up is not christ-like & it is our duty as women & members of the community to speak against it. Organizing protests is one way to do that. Please come in a PLAIN WHITE TEE in time for the first service (8:30am). Lagos address: 20 Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way, Ikeja Abuja address: Guzape Hills, Asokoro Extension, Guzape, Abuja If there is a change in plan, further details will be passed across.” Please if you have experienced abuse by Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), please send me a DM.
