By Ian Kedem Why is mugging very rampant Nigeria? I don’t know where you’re information comes from. Yes, Nigeria has security problems but that’s like plenty of places. Look at the knife crime now in London! I’ve lived in Nigeria for the last 6 years. I’m a white Israeli living in Plateau State which has seen it’s fair share of security problems. I walk the streets, I’ve never had any problems with muggers and I don’t know anyone who has been mugged. There is a problem with armed robbers on the roads in some rural areas but that’s not mugging as such. Nigeria has a lot of negative news spread around and most of it is not true. Source: Quora
