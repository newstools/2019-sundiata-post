By Mona Nahmias It happened to a friend of mine. She noticed that he was withdrawn, not having sex and stayed later and later at the office. She thought that he was under stress. It turned out that he had a mistress, a colleague of his. She saw them together with a bottle of wine, in the office, when she took a snack for her husband. He did not expect it since it was a surprise. He was kissing his mistress. When she saw them, she made herself known, turned around and left. He never saw his wife again. He was contacted by her lawyer, got divorce papers, all the negotiations were done without her being there including the children visiting times. He tried to reconcile, said he was sorry, ask her lawyer to give him her new phone number, sent letters for reconciliation, to no avail. He never saw her again except at the door when he came to pick up his children and returning them. She refused all dinners with him and the children and never asked him to come for the children birthdays. So the kids had two birthdays, one at mom, one at dad. He stopped seeing his mistress in the hope to get his ex-wife back, she did not give him the chance to talk to her. He regretted his affair deeply. Source: Quora
