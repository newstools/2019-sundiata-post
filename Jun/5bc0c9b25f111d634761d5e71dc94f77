Leicester City forward, Kelechi Iheanacho, has been contacted and placed on standby, as Nigeria await a decision from the CAF Medical Committee on Samuel Kalu’s participation at the Africa Nations Cup. Kalu has been confirmed “okay” and “stabilised”, after he collapsed during training on Friday. The incident happened 24 hours before the Super Eagles open their AFCON campaign against new comers, Burundi. Kalu reportedly fell while trying to take a corner-kick and was immediately rushed to the hospital. CAF officials are now waiting on a full medical report, which will determine whether it was a heart attack dehydration. Since the incident happened within the 24-hour time window before a team is allowed before the kickoff of their opening game, Nigeria may be able to substitute the player if the CAF Medical Committee determines that he cannot compete at the tournament. ColinUdoh.com reports Iheanacho has been contacted and is on standby to join the team in that event. However, the decision to substitute the player would have to be approved by the organising committee. Otherwise, Nigeria will be forced to prosecute the tournament with just 22 players instead of 23. Iheanacho is one of the two players that was dropped from Gernot Rohr’s initial 25-man squad.
