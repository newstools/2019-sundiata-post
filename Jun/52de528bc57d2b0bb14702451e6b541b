By Rebecca Watsson Yes, hurtful. Also devastating. They began as friends. My husband belonged to a group at McDonalds. The majority of the people were elderly men that met for breakfast in the morning. Then out of nowhere three young women joined. They could have been their daughters. They assimilated nicely and the men were taken with their youth and flirty behavior. The group visited my beach house and I was very hospitable. I assumed we were all a group of friends. Then the shock hit me like a traveling asteroid. The women instituted a no spouses allowed rule. I renamed the group Club Erotica. I walked in one day and found my husband in a precarious situation with the one woman he was passionate about. I was reminded in a lengthy diatribe of violating the no spouses rules by being there. I had walked in on their fun and temporarily ruined the mood for that day. Under no circumstance would he stop going to see her no matter how I cried over their affair. I finally had to walk away and move to our Beach House. Which is where I am now. We still see each other but he literally cries like a baby because he is afraid that if he goes to the club it will hurt me but he misses her so much that I literally feel sorry for him. The other old men and younger women have partnered up. Everyone is married and searching for something outside of their marriage. As for my relationship I donâ€™t know what will happen. Next time you see a group of people at a usually innocuous place realize that what is happening there may not actually be as innocent as it seems. I know my world has been shaken to the core because of people who I thought were my friends. Source: Quora
