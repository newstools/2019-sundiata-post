principal officers are genuflecting around executive   and
party tables. Reno who took to his twitter handle @renoomokri shared a
video of Speaker , Femi Gbajabiamila bowing to Chief Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and
also recalled how the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege knelt
down before President Muhammadu Buhari . He tweeted thus: Video
of Speaker Gbajabiamila bowing to Bola @AsiwajuTinubu in Lagos. Somehow,
I do not think Nigeria will have an Independent Legislature with a Deputy @NGRSenate President who
kneels down to General Buhari and a @HouseNGR Speaker who bows
to Tinubu #FreeLeahSharibu #RenosDarts Video of Speaker Gbajabiamila bowing to Bola @AsiwajuTinubu in Lagos.
