Two suspected armed robbers have been beaten to death by an angry mob in Abraka community, Ethiope East council area of Delta State. The suspects Uchenna Ezekonyi, 27 and Mbachu Sunday, 30, were reportedly beaten to death after a failed robbery attack on one Moses Emoghene. The indigenes of Oguta in Imo State had snatched a polythene bag containing the N250,000 from Emoghene, who had withdrawn the cash from the Zenith Bank branch in Abraka. The attempted robbery went sour when Emoghene, who had drawn the cash on behalf of the parish priest of Sacred Heart Catholic Church, raised the alarm as he was being attacked by the duo. The mob that responded to the distress call made by the victim descended heavily on the suspects, beating them so badly the two of them died before policemen could get them to the hospital. When contacted, the Delta State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Adeyinka Adeleke, confirmed the report, saying, “yes, it happened”. Source
