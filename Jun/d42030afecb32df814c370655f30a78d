By Sunday John Lafia – Following the judgement of a Lafia High Court which declared the demolition of Breeze 99.9 FM Radio Station Lafia, of May 20, 2017 by the Nasarawa State Government as illegal, its management has said that plans have been concluded to return to operation. Mr Nawani Aboki, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the station, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lafia. Aboki said following the judgement by the court on June 7, they would soon come on air though not at the former place that was demolished. “We have already secured a place at the Fatima House Jos Road Lafia to serve as our temporary station, hence it is a public building. “Everything is already set, but we are just trying to settle one thing or the order with the Nasarawa Urban Development Board (NUDB) before we commence operation,” the CEO added. He explained that just like in the past prior to the demolition of the station, they would continue to operate in line with laws guiding broadcasting practice. The CEO noted that they were looking forwards to the state government to obey the court judgment by paying them the compensation of N67 million. NAN reports that the court had awarded N67 million as compensation against the Nasarawa Government for illegal demolition of the station. The court also directed the state government to offer public apology to the management of the station.
