By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Senator representing Imo West District in
the National Assembly, Rochas Okorocha, has alleged that the Chief of Staff to
Governor Ihedioha, Chris Okewulonu is irresponsible and urged Governor Ihedioha
to stop sack him. According to him, Okewulonu’s alleged abusive language against
him, a former governor, shows he did not have the temperament and character
required of his office. Recalls that
Okewulonu was recently quoted as telling
Okorocha to “shut up,” following the former governor’s plea to his
successor to halt further embarrassment of his family members by some
government officials. However, a
statement yesterday signed by Okorocha’s media adviser, Sam Onwuemeodo, said
the Senator advised Ihedioha to sack Okewulonu for bringing the office of a
chief of staff to disrepute. “We want to
swiftly call on Governor Emeka Ihedioha to sack Mr. Chris Okewulonu as Chief of
Staff, Government House because he has shown that he lacks the composure or
discipline and the right temperament such sensitive office requires. “Mr. Okewulonu
openly told the immediate past governor of the state, Senator Rochas Okorocha
to shut up, which went viral in the media. For making such callous statement about the immediate past
governor of the state, Mr. Okewulonu only showed that he is highly
irresponsible and never had any proper upbringing,” the statement said.
