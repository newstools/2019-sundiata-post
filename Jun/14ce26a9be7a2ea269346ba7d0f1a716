Post recalls that similar brutal murder of another lecturer took place in the
state in April. At about
middle of April, unidentified gunmen reportedly murdered Dr. Vincent Eebe, a
lecturer of the Ken Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic in River State. The lecturer was shot several
times by his assailants along Bua-Yeghe in Gokana Local Government Area of
Rivers State. Eebe, a senior lecturer and the Director of Industrial Training of the
polytechnics, Bori, was shot dead by suspected assassins on his way home from
the polytechnic. It was
learnt that  Eebe was heading back to his Port Harcourt residence before
he was bracketed at Bua-Yeghe. A
community source, who gave his name simply as Henry, said that the victim was
trailed by his killers from his office. The
source pointed out that when the victim noticed that a car was trailing him, he
immediately ran out of the car in his bid to escape an attack. It was
gathered that when Eebe raced out of his car, the hoodlums ran after him and
shot him several times and waited to ensure that he was dead before they drove
off.
