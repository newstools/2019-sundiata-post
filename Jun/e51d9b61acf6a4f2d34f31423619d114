By Yunus Yusuf Lagos – An integrated oil and gas company, Rainoil Ltd., says it will continue to drive commercial activities and create more jobs opportunities in the downstream sub-sector in Kwara and Gombe States. Mrs Chiamaka Uwadoka, the Brand and Corporate Communications Executive of the company, made this known on Thursday in Lagos. Uwadoka said the company had commissioned two retail stations in Gombe and Kwara to ease product distribution chain in the communities. She also said that the company has plans to further expand its retails outlets nationwide. “Rainoil currently operated over 71 service stations across the country with substantial market share across the entire downstream. “These include value chain of logistics, bulk storage, shipping and retail,” Uwadoka said. According to her, the company seeks to create superior value by increasing market access and drive socioeconomic development and provide easy access to quality products to its loyal customer-base across the country. The spokesperson expressed the company’s satisfaction with its investments in those states, hoping that they would drive commercial activities. Uwadoka said that would in turn generate revenue and see indigenous members of the community provided with jobs. “With its entry into Gombe and Kwara, the company now operates in 17 states across Nigeria, with immediate plans to expand further. “We also commissioned a station in Eket, Akwa-Ibom, its third station in the state. “Information gleaned from the company’s portals suggests that concurrent openings of retail spaces are in line with its aggressive retail roll-out agenda. “The official announcement of the expansion agenda will come on the heels of the company’s commission of its multi-product depot at Ijegun, Lagos,” she said.
