An Ikeja High Court, Lagos has remanded a middle-aged man, Elvis Enegbeta Chris, in Ikoyi Prison Custody for allegedly killing his four-year-old son with a hot pressing iron. Elvis, who pleaded not guilty, was arraigned on a one-count charge of murder. According to the prosecutor, M.T Adewoye, the defendant committed the alleged offence sometime in July 2015 at Meiran, Ojokoro area, Lagos. Adewoye said that Chris killed his four-year-old son at his residence by using a hot pressing iron on his body and thereafter dumped the corpse inside a plastic drum in bid to cover up the act. The prosecutor said that the offence contravened Sections 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Meanwhile, a Counsel representing the office of the public defendant (OPD), E.B Obogwu, who had earlier stood in for the defendant, however, applied to the court to withdraw his appearance immediately after the arraignment. Obogwu told the court that he can no longer represent the defendant since the matter is an issue that involves the death of a minor. Reacting to the request of the OPD lawyer, Justice Hakeem Oshodi, reiterated that the issue of age of a deceased doesnâ€™t apply in a murder case. Justice Oshodi said that the case involves an issue of life and therefore, the question of segregation in the murder of a child or minor does not arise. The judge thereafter ordered that the defendant be remanded in Ikoyi prison pending the determination of the case. The matter was thereafter adjourned till 13th of November, 2019 for trial. Source
