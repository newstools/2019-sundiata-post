The incident, which led to exchange of gun fire, caused pandemonium on Owerri-Okigwe Expressway.

One of the policemen, who engaged the armed robbers in a gun battle, said one of the hoodlums died instantly while three others escaped with bullet wounds. He said, “They trailed the man from a bank in Mbieri and when their target noticed that he was being trailed, he diverted his movement and headed for our station. “The man stopped and ran to our station and the idiots had the gut to chase him to our station and open fire on us. We responded and gunned one of them down. Three others escaped with bullet wounds.” The police source told our correspondent that a pistol with five expended bullets and one unexpended bullet was recovered from the slain robber.
