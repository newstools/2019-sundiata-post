Governors will never learn. I know of no governor installed by a departing governor (godfather) who did not fall out with his godfather. It’s inevitable, a simple law of nature. Two big egos cannot coexist harmoniously, and a distant godfather, however powerful, cannot continue to control the godson who now has all the levers of power. Something has to give and an all-or-nothing, zero-sum showdown is only a matter of time. Political loyalty, like everything else in Nigeria, is situational. Edo is boiling today because of a drama we’ve seen many times before. Some godfathers prevail but in most cases the godsons consign their godfathers to political retirement and irrelevance. Akpabio and Akume come to mind as recent examples. As a departing governor, why not simply create a level playing field and a fair contest for your successor to emerge? Whoever emerges out of such a transparent, even-handed process will not be beholden to you but at least he will be honest in his dealings with you. He will not pretend to be your “boy,” conceal his true agenda, and then blindsight and decimate you when you try to assert and reaffirm your hegemony. Heck, your successor under a democratic process may even accord you some deference for allowing a fair process that brought him to power. Source: Facebook
