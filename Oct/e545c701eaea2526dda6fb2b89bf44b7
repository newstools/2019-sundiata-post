Founder of the Sword of the Spirit Ministries, Ibadan, Bishop Wale Oke, has said that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo revealed that “some cabals” were behind allegations of corruption against him. Osinbajo was inter alia recently accused by a former spokesman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timi Frank, of receiving and mismanaging N90 billion from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) as campaign funds for 2019 elections. A report published on September 20 by Roots TV Nigeria also alleged that Prof. Osinbajo used federal agencies under his supervision as vice president “to stack funds” for 2023 general elections. Speaking on Thursday while receiving the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists, led by Jadesola Ajibola, at his church, Oke said that when the news of the N90 billion illegal funding went viral, some Christian elders visited Osinbajo. “The VP did not only deny involving himself in any sleaze but used the opportunity to inform us that some cabals were behind the allegations,” he said. The cleric said that Nigerians must learn to reward committed, loyal and patriotic citizens in a positive way and at the same time, expose people who were corrupt. “The VP is always reaching out to Christian leaders on the need to support Buhari. Osinbajo is loyal to a fault. “So, those plotting his downfall through orchestrated campaigns should fear God. This man is not corrupt. He has been a friend for many years,” he added. Qed
