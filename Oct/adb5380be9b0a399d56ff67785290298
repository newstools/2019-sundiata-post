By Adenike Ayodele Ikeja – For allegedly stealing a tricycle kept in their care, two petrol station guards on Thursday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on a two-count charge. The police arraigned Mosheed Fabowale, 57, and Emmanuel Sunday, 21, before Chief Magistrate A. A. Fashola. The duo, whose addresses were not provided, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges of conspiracy and stealing. According to the Prosecutor, Sgt. Michael Unah, the defendants conspired and stole a TVS King Tricycle with Reg. No. KRD116QH. He said that the tricycle valued at N670, 000, belonged to  the  complainant, Mr John Omachu. Unah told the court that that the defendants committed the offences with others still at large on Oct. 23 at 11.15p.m. at NIPCO Filling Station, Surulere Street, Dopemu in Agege, a Lagos suburb. He submitted that the defendants always collected  N200 from the complainant whenever he packed the tricycle at the filling station. “The defendants usually collected N200 from the complainant for safe-keeping the tricycle. “The complainant suspected the defendants and reported to the police after his tricycle got missing at the filling station,” the prosecutor said. The chief magistrate admitted the defendants to N100, 000 bail with two sureties in like sum. He ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed and have evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the alleged offences contravene Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (revised). Stealing attracts three years’ jail term while conspiracy is punished with two years’ imprisonment. The chief magistrate adjourned the case until Dec. 18 for mention.
