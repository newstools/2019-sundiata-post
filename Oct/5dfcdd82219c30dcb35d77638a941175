Former minister of education, Oby Ezekwesili, has expressed concern over the new bail conditions granted the convener of #RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore. Mr Sowore was on Friday granted N100 million bail by Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of a Federal High Court in Abuja. Justice Ojukwu also ruled that Sowore is to produce two sureties in like sum and deposit the sum of N50 million in the account of the court as security. The sureties, she said, must be resident in Abuja, and also have landed property in Abuja worth the bail sum, and they are to deposit the original title documents of the assets with the court. She also barred Sowore from travelling out of Abuja and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare, from leaving Osogbo during the trial. In a tweet on Friday, Mrs Ezekwesili said she hoped the Department of State Services (DSS) would honour the bail if the conditions are met. She also accused the presidency of repression. 1. Hopefully the DSS under the supervision of the Presidency will honor this Bail and release them 2.What kind of Bail of N150m is this? Is the idea to place a steep condition that @YeleSowore cannot meet?3. What a shame @NGRPresident . What a BIG shame to repress your citizen. https://t.co/W0fWrIL5vB “Hopefully the DSS under the supervision of the Presidency will honour this Bail and release them,” she said. “What kind of bail of N150m is this?

DSS had refused to obey an order by Justice Taiwo Taiwo of a Federal High Court in Abuja on September 24 for Sowore’s release. Qed
