New York – The UN Security Council (UNSC), would discuss Turkey’s assault on Northern Syria during a meeting on Wednesday, a diplomatic source told dpa. The source said Germany made the request, representing all EU members on the UNSC, France, Poland, Britain and Belgium. The UNSC meeting had already been scheduled and Germany requested Syria be discussed. Earlier, the UNSC discussed Ankara’s assault on Syria behind closed doors but failed to reach a joint communication. However, following the meeting, the EU member countries called for an end to the offensive.
