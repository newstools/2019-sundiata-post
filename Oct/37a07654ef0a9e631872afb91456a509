ABUJA – The National Chairman of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus has said ultimate judgement comes from God in whatever anyone does.Reacting to the Supreme Court decision on Wednesday striking out the appeal of the PDP and its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in a statement from his media office, Secondus said that the nation’s apex court has ruled but the final judgement comes from God almighty. He expressed gratitude to Nigerians of all divides for their commitment and support to the party and to democracy. Prince Secondus said that the commitment of Nigerians to democracy and its tenets despite inhibiting factors is worthy of emulation and highly commendable.“We thank you for your support for PDP, for your commitment to  democracy. Nigerians know that you voted PDP, even APC knows that you rejected them on February 23, 2019, international community knows you voted for PDP, if Supreme Court of seven justices says otherwise, leave it to God the ultimate Judge.”He also commended the press, the fourth estate of the realm for their commitment to democracy and good governance in Nigeria but urged them not to relent in their roles of holding politicians accountable to the people.The PDP national chairman, however, told the people to remain resolute in their prayers to God since the country is in such a untidy state that only God could bail her out.
