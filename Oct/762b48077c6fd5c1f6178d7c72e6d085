Osogbo – EFCC, Ibadan zonal office, on Monday, October 14, 2019, raided a Osogbo-based nightclub notorious for hosting parties for suspected internet fraudsters. The raid led to the arrest of 94 suspects and confiscation of 19 exotic cars, laptops, scores of sophisticated mobile phones and other items. Popularly known as ‘Club Secret Underground’, the nightclub is located on the Ibadan-Iwo Expressway, Osogbo. The wee-hour operation was sequel to an intelligence report hinting that the suspected internet fraudsters were organising a night party for Sunday, October 13, during which some of them intended to celebrate their loots.
