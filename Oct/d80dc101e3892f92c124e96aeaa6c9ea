Kathmandu – Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been admitted to a private hospital in Kathmandu, which on Thursday raised concerns about the ailing leader’s health. Oli, 66, was rushed to Grande Hospital on Wednesday, with his spokesmen saying it was a “routine checkup,” but local media have reported that he underwent dialysis for his kidney. The Nepalese leader was admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital, where he underwent dialysis for renal disease, Kantipur, Nepal’s national newspaper said. According to doctors, Oli travelled twice in August to Singapore, where doctors removed excess antibodies, which can reject a transplanted kidney. Oli, who is the chairman of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, underwent a kidney transplant 12 years ago in India. Since then, he has frequently travelled to India, Thailand, and Singapore for follow-up treatments.
