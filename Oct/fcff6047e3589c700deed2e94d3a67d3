 Multiple award-winning Nigerian writer Chimamanda Adichie has been named as one of the 100 Most Influential People of African descent by the Africa Report. Adichie is Number four on the list, and is the only other Nigerian in the top five apart from Aliko Dangote who is the number one on the list. She is followed by South-African born television personality and comedian, Trevor Noah, who is number five. The Africa Report in a series of articles published on its platform said Adichie had continued her stratospheric ascent, engaging audiences about racism, sexism and the human condition. Also included in The Africa Report’s list is Chief Executive Officer of leading global bank Credit Suisse, Tidjane Thiam (Cote D’Ivoire); Chairman of the largest media group by market capitalisation outside the US and China, Koos Bekker (South Africa); and the current Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed. Other Nigerians on the list include the General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God Pastor Enoch Adeboye, award-winning artiste and record label executive, Davido, leading global banker Adebayo Ogunlesi, and tech entrepreneur Iyinoluwa Aboyeji.
