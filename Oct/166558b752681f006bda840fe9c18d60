•Ambode and Fayemi ABUJA – A former state governor and an incumbent have emerged as early favourites in the search by power brokers in the Presidency and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for a successor to President Muhammadu Buhari. They are immediate past Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode and returnee Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi. A credible source close to Aso Presidential Villa who spoke recently with News Express disclosed that Buhari is unlikely to be succeeded by a fellow Muslim, adding that the party would most likely field a qualified and marketable Christian from the South-West as presidential candidate in 2023, with a Northern Muslim as running mate. “Ambode and Fayemi are seriously being considered,” the source said, adding: “Ambode is one man to watch despite the troubles now. He is well loved in the party and even in the Villa by the kitchen cabinet.” On Fayemi, the source said: “Fayemi has issues. The conservatives in the Presidency are not comfortable with Fayemi’s appointments in Ekiti.” The source described Ambode’s current limited visibility as an advantage. “At this stage visibility is a minus,” he said. He also described Ambode’s lack of connect among South-West power brokers as another advantage, saying: “This is even better. Obj (Ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo) also didn’t connect with anyone in the SW in 1999.” (News Express)
