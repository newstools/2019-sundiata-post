Abdullah Qardash, a former officer in Saddam Hussein’s army has reportedly taken over as the leader of ISIS after the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to Sun UK. Qardash, also known as the Professor, is believed to have assumed control of the day-to-day running of the jihadi group. Baghdadi was killed when US forces swooped on his compound in northwestern Syria and he blew up himself with a suicide vest after being cornered in a tunnel. US President, Donald Trump said the terror chief died “crying, whimpering and screaming and bringing three kids with him.” Qardash was reportedly appointed as Baghdadi’s successor in August after the terror chief was wounded in an airstrike and was also suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure.
