Yuudee Nyut, Executive Producer of Voguefilms Productions said the movie promises twists that would keep viewers glued to the screen. On the choice of location, Yuudee said she decided to spotlight Akwa Ibom to the world, based on her mindset of improving the entertainment industry in the state. “Akwa Ibom is beautiful and serene with good roads, less traffic which makes movement from a location to another easier,” she said. “I knew we would shoot as late as 2am or 3am, so I had to choose a state I was guaranteed the safety of my cast and crew members.” The Nation
