Teebillz has apologized to OAP Do2dtun over death threat he received when he announced he would be interviewing Tacha. The death threat appears to have been issued by angry Tacha fans who wondered why he wanted to interview her despite his stance against her during the BBNaija show. The threat led to OAP Do2dtun announcing that he would call the interview off if Tacha’s management doesn’t apologize to him. Teebillz, who now manages Tacha, took to social media in reaction to his stance: “Brother Naija was a game, a beautiful experience with life lessons for Tacha @symply_tacha , every criticism during the show was according to personal views and everyone owns a right to their opinion. It doesn’t necessarily have to be the same as yours or yours as theirs.
Now the game is over, its time for reality! Tacha is embarking on a fresh start with a completely different journey. There isn’t going to be a journey without the largest fanbase #TITANS, I know your love runs deep for her brand but we have to extend this love to every human. It is important that THE TITANS are also a part of this growth journey. Let’s spread love always @do2dtun the management apologizes for any mishap. We love you all #BillzVIZION #PositiveVibesOnly”
