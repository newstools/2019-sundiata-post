In a tweet on Friday, she said she could not understand why such happened to her parents who were godly people. “Losing both parents at 8 was traumatic, they were born again, heck we just finished morning devotion when the explosion happened, I couldn’t understand how the God they served so much will let them down just like that, still don’t. I was told not to question God but I was hurting,” she wrote.
