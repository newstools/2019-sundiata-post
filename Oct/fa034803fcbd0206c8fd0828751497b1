Ogun State Goverrnor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has alerted members of the public to be wary of fake complimentary cards currently in circulation. The Goverrnor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, said the cards were forged to insinuate that the seat of Government had relocated to the Governor’s country home at Iperu-Remo. The Governor wishes to affirm that he had no hand in the fake complimentary card bearing Iperu-Remo as his official office and would not reduce the office to a “family estate” “Every right thinking person knows that Oke Mosan, Abeokuta is the official seat of the Governor of Ogun State. We have promised to uphold the rule of law and provide good governance. We have scrupulously stay on that course.” Therefore, we have no doubt that the printing and circulation of these fake complimentary cards must be the handiwork of mischief makers who have sinisterly ulterior motives”. Prince Abiodun said while the Emmanuel Villa, Iperu-Remo is his private residence, “nobody can transfer the instrument of office to a country home. It must be part of the campaign of calumny to disparage and lower the esteem of the Governor before the right thinking members of the public and the good people of Ogun State who gave him the mandate to govern them, the statement added. Somorin noted that: “Prince Abiodun is not a provincialist and would not turn Ogun State to Abiodun & Brothers Limited as was the case in the immediate past. The whole of Ogun State is his constituency, not a fraction of it” The Goverrnor urged members of the public to disregard any complimentary card that bears the address of his private residence. He urged the people to be mindful of those they deal with so as not to be scammed by unscrupulous people using his name
