He group regretted the rot that has eaten deep into the very fabric of the Nigerian Customs Service whose officials no longer hide their inclination to extortion and corruption perpetrated especially against Igbo traders doing legitimate business. According to statement issued by the group, Ohaneze Youth Council alleged that through verified complaints, officials of the Customs Service has continued to request some undue and illegal levies from Igbo importers as a condition for clearing goods. “They also stop Igbo traders on the roadways and demand illegal fees.
