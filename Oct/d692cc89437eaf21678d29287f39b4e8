Actor Femi Adebayo Salami dressed in female clothes for a movie role then went on to twerk in line with his role. The actor had on a wig, sleeveless dress, and wedge sandals for the role. He even went as far as showing off his twerking skills which seem very far from the Instagram standard set by Bobrisky and his colleague, James Brown. Reacting to the role that required him to cross-dress, Femi wrote:‚ÄùHonestly women are trying‚Ä¶ The heat under this wig Couldn‚Äôt wait for cut from Director.. I have another video, I don‚Äôt know if I should post it?‚Äù This is not the first the first time the married man and father of kids will be playing a role like this. He seems to have carved a niche for himself in this area. Watch the short video clip below: I don't know how the producer got me to play this role but you will surely love it .. üòÅ ‚Ä¶ Which lady twerk pass me ?
