Yemi Osinbajo is being disingenuous when he said on Twitter today that he’d waive his “constitutional immunity” to allow for a fair probe of allegations of humongous corruption against him. He can’t legally waive his immunity while still in office.That’s unconstitutional. He should resign and the immunity he enjoys will be gone by default! What he’s doing by suing his critics is what we call SLAPP in American media law. The acronym stands for “Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation.” It’s a type of frivolous lawsuit whose ultimate goal is to intimidate critics into silence and self-censorship, not necessarily to seek redress for injury to reputation. It won’t get him anywhere. Source: Facebook
