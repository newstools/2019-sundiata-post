I got to Tosin house, since her mum was around, I felt like saying hello to her.“I got there that morning. We exchanged pleasantries. Her mum said she was happy to see me and we discussed for few minutes. Suddenly, the atmosphere changed and an argument began and before I knew it, I have stabbed her (Tosin) and her mum. Then, I came to myself, it was like a scale off my eyes…” Ogundele who was found guilty of stabbing Ashinwo who rejected his marriage proposal with the intention of causing her death, is to serve a 25 years jail term for the offence.
