Following the recent order by President Muhammadu Buhari for a forensic audit of the Niger Delta Development Commission NDDC over allegations of shady employment and contract deals, the Niger Delta Youth Vanguard (NDYV) and Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-militants (CONDEM) have urged Mr. President to inaugurate the newly nominated board of NDDC to assist the forensic audit team that will be put in place. The group in a statement signed by National Coordinator of NDYV, Engr. Yamaabana Legborsi and Leader of CONDEM, ‘General’ Victor Ebikoma, threatened that if the current interim management of the NDDC is allowed to supervise the forensic audit, they would mobilise it ranks and files and other Pan-Niger Delta groups for a mass protest to shut down NDDC. According to the group, their call for the inauguration of the newly nominated board of the NDDC to assist the forensic team was because of the public outcry and criticism against the interim board of the NDDC that had been accused of award of contracts that failed due process. The statement reads: “So with the accusation of shady contracts award, the interim management team of the NDDC lacks the credibility to guide the forensic audit team expected to be set up under the directives of Mr. President. “The audit team should not be supervised by the interim team that has been accused of shady deals in the commission rather the new board that was not part of the rot be inaugurated to carry out house cleaning exercise under an atmosphere of transparency that will discourage undue interference.” (Daily Independent)
