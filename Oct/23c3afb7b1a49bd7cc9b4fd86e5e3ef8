A 63-year-old New York pastor, Victor Mateo has been indicted for murdering his estranged wife with a machete after running her over on October 3. Victor who was a pastor at the Christian Congregation The Redeemer Church in the Bronx has been charged with second-degree murder, first-degree manslaughter and three counts of fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon. Bronx District Attorney Darcel D. Clark said: ‘ The defendant cruelly attacked his wife, whom he had been estranged for approximately a month, in front her two young grandchildren.”We will pursue justice for the victim, as well as her family members who have been deeply traumatized by the terrible attack.’ Victor, who had been estranged from Noelia for about a month, reportedly parked his car outside her home and waited for her to emerge. Noelia was reportedly leaving her home to take her nine-year-old granddaughter and 11-year-old grandson to school. When she reached her car, Victor allegedly drove forward and hit Noelia with his car. The victim was able to hide under her vehicle despite Victor trying to get her  out by pulling her legs.   When he was unable to move Noelia, Victor got into her vehicle and ran her over.  Victor then proceeded to stab Noelia with a machete while her grandchildren and neighbors watched on in horror. Victor fled the scene in the victim’s car and escaped before authorities could arrive.   Noelia succumbed to her injuries and died at the scene.   Local reports have it that Noelia was praying as she died.  Victor continued to elude the authorities and was finally captured on October 10.
