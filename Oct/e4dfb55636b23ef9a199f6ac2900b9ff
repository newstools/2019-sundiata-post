The producer behind Wizkid’s latest hit, Joro has taken to Twitter to air out his frustration at the singer. Northboi, who has produced songs like Soco, Gucci Snake (co-produced with Killertunes) for Wizkid has been sending out subliminal tweets at the Starboy, due to him not being appreciated and credited by the singer. Wizkid had been showing love to producer, Killertunes all day, who he said produced Joro, and made his coming album, ‘Made in Lagos’. This didn’t go down well with Northboi who says he actually produced Joro and also has production credits on the album, and he had this to say; Northboi went ahead to reveal the type of relationship between himself and Wizkid, saying when he asked for a contract for ‘Joro’, Wizkid threatened him with a gun. “He threatened me with a gun one time all cuz I asked for the contract of Joro”, the producer shared on Twitter. “He keeps threatening me and I work hard to make these virals” Checkout his tweets below;
