Social media followers of Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, have responded to his tweet berating road users who drive against the traffic. The governor could be seen in the photographs accompanying his tweet, supervising the arrest of drivers who drove against the traffic in as unstated area of the state. In justifying the arrests, Sanwo-Olu, on Thursday, had tweeted: “There’s no excuse for road users to break traffic rules by taking one-way and going against traffic. “Today was an unlucky day for perpetrators of this selfish and disorderly act. “Behaviour such as this will not be tolerated. Let’s not make total bedlam of our roads.” The tweet has since, received tens of reactions.

He that comes to equity must come with clean hands. Equity, your excellency. Equity. He who comes to it must come with clean hands.Before you complain about citizens breaking rules, you must first ask whether govt has kept its side of the bargain by making the roads useable after collecting road-worthiness taxes & othersCheers Whilst not excusing bad driver behaviour WHERE ROADS ARE REASONABLY MOTORABLE, it must be said sir, that you as governor may be unfair to Lagosians by allowing our roads to deteriorate to these levels despite the huge taxes we suffer through them to pay YOUR Government. Fix the roads first.. do your job first .. lead by example, we can’t be changing shock absorbers every 3 months .. 😒 Fix the grid lock and the bad roads first, then you can arrest all traffic offenders. Lagos Roads are very bad and they are being fixed every day. For those spewing rubbish on this street, did the roads just got this bad within the last 4 months. Bad roads is not an excuse to take one way. If everyone took one way, wouldn't it be counter productive? So this is the only thing Lagosians voted you to do😏-your 1st day at work: traffic rule-Day 2 – yesterday: you're a ghost worker.-6 months after, one-way traffic ruleDo you realize that if the roads are good many drivers won't consider breaking the traffic rules
