A kidnap suspect has made a starling confession after being nabbed for his criminal acts in Niger State. According to The Nation, another suspect has been arrested in connection with the kidnapping of the daughter of one Sariki Aliyu, of Kudun-Gure Fulani settlement camp Kotonkoro in Mariga Local Government Area of State by the Niger State Police Command. It would be recalled that the Police had already arrested one of the members of the gang, Mohammed Betuwa and rescued the victim unhurt. The second suspect, 35-year-old Hamidu Badori, was trailed and arrested by the operatives of Bangi Division while the others are still on the run. Badori, when he was paraded by the Police, lamented that his wife who does not know he is a kidnapper would divorce him once she hears the news about him. He said that bad company and greed led to his involvement in kidnapping, saying that he should have been contented with his farm work. “I should have concentrated on my farm work, even though the money is small at least I would have saved my good and that of my family. I have realised that what I did was wrong between man and God and I pray that my family forgave me. I have dragged my family name to mud. “My wife does not know that I am a kidnapper and there is every possibility that she will divorce me at the end of the day.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Muhammad Abubakar said that the Police are on the trail of the three fleeing suspects adding that the case would soon be charged to court.
