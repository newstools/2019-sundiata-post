Dr Vincent Uzomah, a Nigerian physics teacher, who was stabbed in the stomach by his 14-year-old student has said that he is still afraid to teach in a secondary school. According to Skynews, Uzomah revealed his fear in the light of recent reports that more children are taking weapons to school.“I was teaching in the classroom and he just pulled out a knife and stabbed me in the stomach. It was such a horrible experience. No-one should have to go through the same thing,” said Uzomah. The incident happened in June 2015 and Dr Uzomah now teaches at a university in Greater Manchester. As of the time of the attack, Dr Uzomah was a part-time teacher at a secondary school, the Dixon Kings Academy, a mixed-sex free school in Bradford, West Yorkshire. “The attack made me not go back to secondary schools anymore,” Dr Uzomah says. “But the impact continues even here. Sometimes when I’m clustered by students I start feeling very uncomfortable. So it’s an ongoing thing.” Source
