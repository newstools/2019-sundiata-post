Abuja (Sundiata
Post) – The upper chamber of the National Assembly has while meeting with the
chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Wednesday
that it would reduce the number of political parties participating in elections
in Nigeria from the current 91 to five through legislation. Speaking during
the meeting, former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu (PDP Enugu
West), pointed out that the numbers of political parties contesting elections
in the country is a contravention of the amended Electoral Act. He added that
any Political Party that fails to win a single seat during the last general
election out be deregistered. Senator Kabiru
Gaya (APC Kano South), the chairman senate committee on INEC on his part said: “Those parties
that didn’t perform shouldn’t be on the ballot. The existing electoral act as
amended has precluded the participation of parties that didn’t perform in the
last elections. “We need to
amend the act to reduce the political parties to a maximum of five. This
committee is really committed to reducing the number of political parties to
save taxpayers money.” INEC Chairman, Professor Yakubu Mahmood, while
responding said: “The commission had systematically deregistered many parties under the
electoral act. But the parties insisted that the electoral act is inferior to
the constitution,” Professor Yakubu told the senators.
