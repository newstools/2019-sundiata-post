Kebbi – The hardship in Nigeria appears to be unsettling the mental state of a northerner who has done the unthinkable. A middle-aged man created a scene, yesterday, in Ribah, Kebbi State, as he climbed a mast and vowed not to descend from it until President Muhammadu Buhari resigns. At a point, his Local Government Chairman pleaded with him to come down and promised to give him a brand new motorcycle, but he refused. However, after a long period of persuasion, he gave in and was immediately whisked away.
