Nigerians have launched attacks at a senior lecturer in the Faculty of Arts, University of Lagos (UNILAG), Dr. Boniface Igbeneghu, who has been exposed in a BBC SexForGrades documentary. The 13-minute documentary published on Monday was focused on Unilag and the University of Ghana. BBC Africa Eye, after interviewing several students who had been abused, sent undercover journalists posing as students to lecturers who were in the habit of harassing students. Igbeneghu, who is also the head pastor of a Foursquare Gospel Church in Lagos, on his first meeting with one of the journalists who posed as a 17-year-old admission seeker, commented on her appearance. He revealed that there was a location inside the UNILAG Staff club known as ‚Äòcold room‚Äô where lecturers take female students for sexual pleasures. On his final meeting with the journalist, he attempted to show her the ‚Äòcold room‚Äô experience by requesting a kiss. BBC Africa Eye said that despite repeated requests, the lecturer failed to react to the allegations of sexual harassment. Nigerians on Twitter have called on UNILAG authorities to terminate the lecturer‚Äôs appointment.
