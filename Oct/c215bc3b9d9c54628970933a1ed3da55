The political set-up of Lagos State is anti-progress for the common man. It is all about sustaining a hegemonic hold on the ECONOMY and POLITICAL DESTINY of the state. Tinubu has mastered this to perfection. And I am afraid, it will continue to work for him. He knows what an average Nigerian wants in politics: MONEY and INFLUENCE. When you work for him, he allows you enjoy these as if tomorrow won’t ever come. And in Lagos State, he has exploited this our COLLECTIVE GREED to a devastating effect while he exercises a control that would make even Hitler turn in his grave. He will ‘sanction’ trickles of projects here and there (which are hyped so much) but the greater focus is on party members’ “welfare”. PARTY LEADERS, POLITICAL APPOINTEES, MONARCHS, MARKET WOMEN LEADERS and TRANSPORT UNION LEADERS must always be made ‘happy’! Contract for roads, hospitals, school renovations and so on will be CRIMINALLY INFLATED and awarded to people from the groups above. As if this is not bad enough, these contracts are either not executed or poorly executed. For every major project hyped, TEN (that would have had direct positive impact on the people) have been DELIBERATELY BUNGLED! And these guys get away with it! Why? They are needed for the next election. They too have their loyalists, supporters and hangers-on. The crumbs get to them and the message is not lost on these supporters and hangers-on where the money is coming from. Go and do your findings: no state in the federation are party leaders, appointees are as rich as those of Lagos State. I KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING! And these guys are FIERCELY LOYAL to the man and system that allowed (and still allowing) them to be made, some for life! You may disagree with me but that is the current but crazy set-up in Lagos State. And it won’t change soon. It can only change when the CONSCIENCES OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THIS ODDITY BEGIN TO PRICK THEM and they say “enough”! And it is no brainer why there is almost a total collapse of infrastructure in the state. Lest I forget, they would blame Ambode as if Lagos was paradise before 2015! Source: Facebook
