•The late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe By Pamela Eboh AWKA – The Governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to declare November 16 a national public holiday in honour of late first President of Nigeria, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, starting from this year. He made the call Tuesday in his Independence Day speech, saying that the significance of the day is that it is the birthday of late Azikiwe, “who contributed immensely to the development and peace.” Reading President Buahri’s address at the Alex Ekwueme Square, Awka, to mark the country’s 59th year anniversary, Obiano identified corruption as the major issue standing on the wheel of Nigeria’s progress. The governor urged Anambra people to shun divisive tendencies and keep faith with the Nigeria project. He noted that for Nigeria to grow and move forward, other philanthropists should borrow a leaf from people like Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Air Peace boss, Allen Onyema, and Chief Innocent Chukwuma. In his speech, the Chief of Staff to Governor Obiano, Hon. Primius Odili, urged Nigerian leaders to make use of available natural resources in the country to create jobs for the teeming youths.He advocated for a paradigm shift in the running of the affairs of the country, saying that young people between the ages of 30 and 35 years should be allowed to take over the affairs of the country, like President Buhari, Gen. Yakubu Gowon (rtd.) and late Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu did during their youthful days. Odili said that the country is blessed with enough natural resources which if put into proper use by the leaders would create viable economic growth that will improve the life of the citizenry. (News Express)
