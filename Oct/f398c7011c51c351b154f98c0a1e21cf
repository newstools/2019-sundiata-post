Police in Kwara have rescued 108 persons detained at an illegal rehabilitation cente in Ilorin. Police commissioner, Kayode Egbetokun, said on Thursday that the victims rescued from Sumuratu Mumeen Arabic Centre, Gaa-Odota Area were subjected to inhuman treatment. Mr Egbetokun said 103 males and five females were discovered unlawfully detained. “Some of the victims were observed to have some forms of infections and diseases and were not treated while some others were mentally ill. “Some of them during interview claim they were brought to the centre by their parents,” he said. The commissioner added that the police would take care of the victims until their parents come for them. One of the victims, Waliyu Ali, said his parents took him there because he was addicted to marijuana. He added that his parents believed that the place was a rehabilitation centre and that he would stop smoking marijuana after spending some months there. One of the female victims, Olaide Arikewuyo, said she had spent five years in the centre and alleged that she had been sexually abused by the uncle of the owner of the facility. “I am living with the owner of the centre in their apartment and the uncle used to have canal knowledge of me every night. “Since I have nobody to turn to and it is not easy to escape from there, I have been abused by five men. “In the process, I got impregnated and had three abortions. I just thank God that the police came to my rescue,” she said. President Muhammadu Buhari had on October 19 directed the police to uncover all illegal rehabilitation centres nationwide. Qed
