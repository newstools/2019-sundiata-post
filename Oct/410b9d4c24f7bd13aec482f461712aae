Elvisound Ldk, a 24-year old young man was able fo find love in the hands of an elderly white woman he met online. The woman seems old enough to be a grandmother to Elvis who is based in Ughelli, Delta State. The lovebirds tied the knot in the presence of friends, family members and well-wishers recently in the southern part of Nigeria. Nigerians on social media have attacked Elvis on Facebook, forcing the young man to delete most of their wedding pictures off his social media. In recent times, a lot of Nigerians get married to lonely and elderly foreigners to secure visas to move abroad. This has been traced to the lack of economic opportunities in the country. Source
