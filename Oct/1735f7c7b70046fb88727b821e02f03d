By Amina Ahmed Bauchi – The Imam of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Teaching Hospital (ATBU TH) Central Mosque in Bauchi, Sheikh  Mujdafa Haruna , says ‘showing-off, while assisting the needy or performing religious activities amounted to exercise in futility. Haruna have this word of caution while delivering his sermons shortly before leading the day’s Friday congression prayers. He said that actions were judged according to intentions and therefore advised faithful  to be mindful of  engaging in religious exercises and losing the reward. “There are instances when people tend to show-off while supporting the needy. “Actions should be done to seek Allahs’ reward, not for people to see and praise.“A Muslim should be steadfast and devoted towards seeking Allah’s forgiveness at all times, that way, one would receive blessing of God,” he said.(NAN)
