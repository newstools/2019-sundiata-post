By Harry Awurumibe ABUJA – Former President Goodluck  Ebele Jonathan this (Thursday) afternoon stormed Aso Rock Presidential  Villa, Abuja. The former President, who has not visited the seat of government in recent time, arrived State House at about 3.00pm. He went straight to the President’s office where he held a meeting with his host, President Muhammadu Buhari behind closed doors. Jonathan left almost immediately after a short stay without talking to the hordes of media representatives waiting to talk to him.Prompt News Online recalls that Jonathan made history when he conceded defeat and congratulated the then APC presidential candidate in the 2015 general election, Muhammadu Buhari even when votes were still being counted by the election umpire, INEC superintended by Prof Attahiru Jega. (Promptnewsonline)
