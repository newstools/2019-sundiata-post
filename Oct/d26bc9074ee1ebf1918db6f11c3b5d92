The Personal Chief Security Officer (PCSO) to Buhari by the name of Abdulkarim Dauda was supposed to retire this year, but his service has been illegally extended till 2023, as this secret memo shows. The memo suggests that he was supposed to have retired by reason of having worked for up to 35 years in the Nigeria Police even if he’s not yet 60 years old. But the rules are being circumvented. Note that he is Buhari’s biological relative. He is Mamman Daura’s brother and Buhari’s nephew. Recall that Mamman Daura’s father, known as Dauda Daura, is Buhari’s half-brother from the same father. (Mamman Daura is Nigeria’s de facto president for whom Abba Kyari acts.) Abdulkarim Dauda has had one of the fastest promotions in the history of the Nigeria Police. In 2015 when Buhari came to power, he was only a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), but he rapidly rose to the rank of Commissioner of Police in 4 years. That means he went from Chief Superintendent of Police to Assistant Police Commissioner, to Deputy Police Commissioner, and to Police Commissioner in the space of just 4 years! That’s some extraterrestrial supersonic speed! Corrigendum: My friends from Daura just called to say that Abdulkarim Dauda is actually Mamman Daura’s blood brother and Buhari’s nephew. That means, like Mamman Daura, Buhari is his uncle. Source: Facebook
