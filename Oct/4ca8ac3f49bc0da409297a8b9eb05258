Imo State    –   Duncan Mighty was on social media stating that he wants to return the money paid to him by Senator Rochas Okorocha. He revealed that the money which was meant for him to record a song with an artiste affiliated to Okorocha, is now putting his life under threat. However, the artiste named M2 has come out with his own version of the story which sees Duncan Mighty point a gun at him. He said: ‘I was the guy that went viral a while back as Phyno’s look alike, I’m an indigene of Imo State and shortly after that I became quite popular in my state and got the attention of the Governor Rochas Okorocha’. The governor promised to help me and even went as far as sponsoring my education and he tried helping me get a record deal. He spoke to Phyno, but he said he wasn’t signing any artist at that time, we reached out to Eric Many as well, but we couldn’t reach a deal and finally we reached out to Duncan Mighty and he agreed to the deal. Duncan Mighty agreed to take 11million naira from the governor as the fee needed for him to push my brand, record songs and all. So we signed the deal in Imo State on December 18th 2018. Since then, Duncan Mighty disappeared and refused to take my calls, or speak with anyone of the governor’s aides. We kept trying to reach him but all to no avail. So about 3months back, he sneaked into Imo State for a show, he didn’t post about it on social media but we got wind of it so we went to his hotel and got him arrested with the police. He knelt down and started begging us and he was allowed to go. After that, he told me to follow him to Port Harcourt and when we got to his studio, he flipped again and even pointed a gun at me at his studio that’s behind Uniport. I narrowly escaped that night. He was later arrested and detained for 3-days at the Imo State CID before he was bailed on self recognition. Since then, he disappeared again and refused to take our calls till he came on social media to seek sympathy.“ Source
