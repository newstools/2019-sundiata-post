Tacha‘s management has been accused by s*x therapist, Jaruma, of embezzling funds which were raised by fans and some celebrities for the support of the reality star. According to Jaruma, the money which was raised and sent to Tacha’s account are nowhere to be found. She took to her Instagram page this afternoon to reveal that Tacha’s management have been lying over the money that was donated to her. Recall that Tacha had earlier debunked viral claims about her management embezzling funds and making away with all her money. Well, right now it seems that there’s more to the story than we know. Listen to voice note below: #AUDIO……. I have heard all ur cries . On my part, this is what I know…… Sampson should come out & tell the world how much everyone sent with dates! LET EVERYTHING BE TRANSPARENT . Sampson told me that Peter sent them only 100k in August, He said Bobrisky did not send a penny! (Now I’m hearing something different in the voice note above ☝️) . He said Nkechi B S sent them only 20k in August, he said RealAngela O did not send a penny & no one else has sent any money to them……..
