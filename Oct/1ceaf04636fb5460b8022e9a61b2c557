Why did Buhari not sign the Sexual Harassment bill passed by the 8th National Assembly? It prescribed a 5-year jail term for offenders. Not enough, in my opinion, for egregious offenders and recidivists but it might be a deterrent if lecturers know that they would not only be sacked from their jobs but would also be prosecuted and possibly jailed. Did ASUU successfully lobby against the bill? Did Buhari object to it? What exactly happened to that bill? Letâ€™s hear from those who know what happened. Source: Facebook
