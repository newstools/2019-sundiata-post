Both men are facing seven counts bordering on alleged conspiracy to commit treason and money laundering among other charges filed against them by the Nigerian Government. They, however, pleaded not guilty to all the charges when they were arraigned on Monday while Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu ordered their remand in DSS custody.
