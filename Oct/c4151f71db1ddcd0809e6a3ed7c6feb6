DAKAR – Ghana’s economic growth is expected to rise to around 7% this year from 6.3% in 2018, boosted by its extractive industries, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday. The Fund said in a statement at the end of a staff visit that Ghana, which exports oil, gold and cocoa, had maintained macroeconomic stability since the conclusion of a three-year lending programme with the IMF in March.
