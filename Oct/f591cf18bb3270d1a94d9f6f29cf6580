Afrobeat singer, Seun Kuti, has attacked the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) over the group’s silence on sexual harassment in public institutions. Kuti’s reaction followed the publication of the #SexForGrades documentary on Monday by BBC Africa Eye. The 13-minute documentary captured the University of Lagos (UNILAG) and the University of Ghana. A senior lecturer in the Faculty of Arts, UNILAG, Dr Boniface Igbeneghu, was filmed sexually harassing Kiki Mordi, an undercover journalist who posed as a 17-year-old admission seeker in the institution. Seun, son of late Afrobeat pioneer, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, wrote in Pidgin English on Tuesday on Twitter that Nigerians were waiting for ASUU to speak on the burning issue. “ASUU leaders make una no pretend like say una no hear all dis noise about una members accuse of sex for grades in our unis, if na una money struggle now, una go expect both activists and students to rise and fight for una, now d students need una to rise and fight for dem too,” he said.
