•Chief Edwin Clark ABUJA – Chief Edwin Clark, Ijaw leader and politician in an interview with Vanguard has stated that there is nothing the All Progressive Congress (APC) leader, Bola Ahmed Tinubu can offer that the Southeast is incapable of. The 92-year-old elder statesman said the Southwest should give the Southeast ast a chance at the presidency. “They should stop thinking of becoming the President of Nigeria.” He said. “What does Tinubu have to offer that the people of the Southeast cannot offer? What is the justification for them to become the President of Nigeria? Is it because they belong to the APC? “They should not be thinking of how to divide Nigeria. We must all unite and have respect for ourselves.The Southwest should allow other people to have a taste of power.“There is no way the Southwest would be better than the Southeast on the 2023 presidency.” The Ijaw leader, however, claimed there is no politician in Nigeria better than the Igbo. “There is no politician better than the Igbo [Southeast] politician. “The Sardauna of Sokoto and Premier of the Northern Nigeria, Alhaji Ahmadu Bello, played politics together with his Igbo counterparts. “The Mbadiwes and Aja Nwanchukwus were easterners who played leading roles in the development of this country. “What of Nnamdi Azikiwe? Nigeria has qualified people from every region, every state. To say they have not played politics well is unacceptable. Is it because they [the Southeast] fought the civil war they believed in?” Vanguard
