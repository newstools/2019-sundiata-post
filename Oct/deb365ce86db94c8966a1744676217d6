•The late Navy Commander Oluwayemisi Ogundana, Simon and the shallow well where her remains were dumped By AbdulGafar Alabelewe KADUNA – Few weeks after the killing of the Commandant of Command Secondary School of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College (AFCSC), Jaji, Commander Oluyemisi Ogundana, the prime suspect, Benard Simon, has disclosed how he killed the senior Naval officer. Simon, who was among the 50 suspects paraded by Kaduna State Police Commissioner, Ali Aji Janga on Wednesday said, he killed Commander Ogundana alone. CP Janga, while parading the suspected killer said, he raped the Naval officer to death. However, Simon, on the contrary, denied raping Commander Ogundana before or after killing her. He confessed that, contrary to claims that, himself and one other person killed the Naval officer, he did it alone when he sneaked into her house at the Jaji Military Cantonment and hit her on the head with an iron rod. According to the 36-year-old Simon, “I killed Commander Ogundana alone. I sneaked into her house in the evening and hit her on the head with iron rod. “I killed her because she was cheating us in the school. I am a teacher in the school and she was cheating us as staff under her. I killed her to set the whole staff of the school free from her cheating. “There are some financial benefits she deprived us of. She denied me in particular of over N100,000. That is why I killed her to set myself and other staff free from her,” he said. Simon, who equally admitted throwing Commander Ogundana’s mutilated body into a shallow well, however, said he regretted his action. (The Nation)
