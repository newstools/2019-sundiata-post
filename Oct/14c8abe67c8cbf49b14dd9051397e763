She worships God with ease. Being on the same stage with her simply means the anointing that worked for will definitely work for me After the event, while we were taking pictures, she said, ‘Tom,you will go far in this field, just make sure you remain in Christ even when you fame comes’ and I simply said an affirmative Amen because it came with authority’ See more images: Source
