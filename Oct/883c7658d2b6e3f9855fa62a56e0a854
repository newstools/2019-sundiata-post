By Muftau Ogunyemi Akure – The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Ondo State command, has said that it will begin clampdown on any motorist without proper vehicle registration and driver’s licence in the state. The FRSC Sector Commander, Mr Rotimi Adeleye, gave the indication while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday, in Akure. Although Adeleye explained that the command recorded low crashes in the third quarter of the year, he, however, said that more measures had been put in place to arrest traffic offenders in the state. The sector commander, who attributed the low crashes to the manpower injected into the command recently, said that mobile courts had been established in major towns such as Ikare-Akoko, Owo, Akure, Ondo and Ore to try traffic offenders. “We are going to make use of mobile court as an instrument to clampdown on any vehicle without proper registration and driver’s licence, especially as we are approaching the festive period. “Any vehicle that has no proper registration will not be allowed to move within the state, because it is absurd to put vehicle on the road without necessary papers. “Any motorist caught without proper registration and driver’s licence will be compelled to register his vehicle and pay fine for violating traffic rules,” he said. The sector commander urged motorists, commercial motorcyclists and pedestrians to maintain traffic rules whenever they were on the highway. (NAN)
