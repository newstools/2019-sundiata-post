By Martha AgasJos – The new Commissioner of Women Affairs and Social Development in Plateau , Mrs Rebecca Sambo, has pledged to improve girl child education and work with organisations to empower women through skill acquisition programmes. Sambo made the pledge on Wednesday in Jos while taking over the affairs of the ministry. ” The girl child is our future, we should have great concern to empower them through education.Failure to do that threatens our future, “she said. She also said that she would operate an open door policy through which suggestions and constructive criticisms to achieve the mandate of Gov.Simon Lalong for the development of the state would be accepted. Mrs Hassana Ayika, the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, said that more than half of the people of  the state were women, and that most of them were vulnerable and required interventions in order to become self reliant. Ayika said the staff of the ministry would cooperate with the new commissioner in the discharge of her duties. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that Gov Simon Lalong had on Monday inaugurated 23 Commissioners, when he urged them to help to implement the policy thrust of his administration. The thrust hinges on peace, security and good governance, physical infrastructure development and economic rebirth. (NAN)
