BBNaija Season 4 winner, Mercy Eke, has gotten a brand new management for herself, and this decision did not appeal to singer, MC Galaxy at all. The singer immediately unfollowed her on Instagram after she posted the details of her new management for business deals and enquiries. Recall that Mercy had earlier revealed that MC Galaxy is the one in charge of her social media accounts and her manager during her time in Big Brotherâ€™s house. MC Galaxy is yet to reveal his reason for unfollowing the BBNaija winner.
