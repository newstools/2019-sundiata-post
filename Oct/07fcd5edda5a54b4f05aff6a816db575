Lovelyn said that the foundation had, over the years, embarked on frequent empowerment visitations to orphanages and rural communities within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). She said that Wumba was selected for the outreach after a survey of rural communities in the territory to ascertain the areas in need of support and empowerment. The founder of the NGO assured that similar initiatives would be organised in future for other communities in the FCT. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the NGO presented food items and empowerment materials to a cross section of widows, elderly couples as well as the vulnerable young people in the community.
