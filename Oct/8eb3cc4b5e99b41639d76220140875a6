Former chairman, Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Anaocha branch, Anambra state, Chris Adimora on Friday said Igbo presidency would be determined in 2023 by those he referred to as “cabals.” He said it would be difficult for an Igbo man to become the president without the cabals’ blessings. Speaking to newsmen in Onitsha, Adimora maintained that the blessings of the cabals would speed up the aspirations of the Igbos. He said, “It is the cabals that will determine whether or not an Igbo man will become a president of Nigeria in 2023, as is being agitated. “Once the cabals give their blessing to an Igbo man, the road to the presidency would be an easy ride for Ndigbo and the presidency will be accompanied by good governance.” The legal practitioner however advised the cabals to look for a president from the Igbo extraction who would dismantle the evil forces holding Nigeria down. His words, “An Igbo man in Aso Rock will dismantle all the retrogressive forces and institutions that make good governance impossible for the past 59 years but if the cabals insist on not fielding an Igbo man in 2023, this country will cave in on all of us. “For instance, the corruption in Customs and Police force, the rot in the civil service cannot thrive under an Igbo presidency, just as inequity in the system cannot thrive under Igbo presidency because Ndigbo are known for equity. “The poor state of road network in the country cannot be allowed under an Igbo man in the Villa because Igbo men are travelers and they live all over the country. There will be justice in the system. “An Igbo man in presidency will champion a rebirth, rejuvenation and bright new day for Nigeria in all the institution in Nigeria.” The Nation
