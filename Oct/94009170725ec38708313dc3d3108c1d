Kaduna’s Governor Nasir El-Rufai is straight-up Nigeria’s most bigoted and most dangerous public official alive. In a Nov. 9, 2013 tweet, he called Goodluck Jonathan a “lazy, docile, incompetent, clueless, hopeless, useless leader” using a photo of him praying in a church for illustration. Yet this man detains and torments people who criticize him. Abu Hanifa Dadiyata, a critic of his, just disappeared in Kaduna without a trace. Several other critics are in detention. And he recently threatened: “If you want to tweet anything about Kaduna be very careful because I’m watching…” BTW, would he also use a photo of Buhari praying in a mosque to call attention to Buhari’s own quality of being a “lazy, docile, incompetent, clueless, hopeless, useless leader”? Buhari is certainly a far more “lazy, docile, incompetent, clueless, hopeless, useless leader” than Jonathan ever was. There’s a consensus among all right-thinking people that Buhari is Nigeria’s absolute worst leader since independence. The worrying thing is that El-Rufai wants to be Nigeria’s president someday. Given that elections no longer matter even in the slightest, he just might be. Source: Facebook
