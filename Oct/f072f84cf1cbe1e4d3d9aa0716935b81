A teenage boy admitted killing his cheerleader girlfriend and their unborn baby after she told him about the pregnancy too late to have an abortion. Aaron Trejo pleaded guilty to the December 2018 stabbing of 17 year-old Breana Rouhselang at a court hearing in Mishawaka, Indiana, on Wednesday. Trejo, who was 16 at the time, but has since turned 17, also pleaded guilty to the feticide of his unborn child after plunging a knife into Breana’s heart. Breana was six months pregnant when she was knifed to death, with Trejo later carting her corpse outdoors and leaving it behind a restaurant dumpster. During a police interview, he said he had plotted to kill Breana for a week after discovering that she was pregnant with her child, and that the pregnancy was too far advanced to terminate. He told cops: ‘I took action…I took her life,’ and added that he’d knifed Breana in the heart ‘because he thought it would kill (her) quickly.’ Breana lived with her mom, with stepmother Nichole Rouhselang telling ABC that she and the girl’s devastated dad Dave had no idea Breana was pregnant. Dave added that his late daughter was the ‘nicest, sweetest, most innocent girl you’d ever meet.’ The murdered youngsters have since become anti-domestic violence campaigners. Trejo admitted the horrific crimes as part of a plea agreement which will not see him face further charges. He is set to be jailed for between 45 and 65 years for Breana’s murder, with prosecutors advising Trejo should spend 55 years behind bars. Trejo faces a further three and 16 years for the feticide charge, with prosecutors pushing for him to receive nine years. He will be sentenced on January 7. Source: Metro UK
