An Ado-Ekiti Customary Court yesterday dissolved a 14-year-old marriage between Amaka Nwafor, 36, and her husband, Friday Nwafor, 47. The President of the Court, Olayinka Akomolede, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), dissolved the marriage on the grounds of constant fighting and beating, public disgrace, threats to life, and lack of regard for the wife’s family by the respondent. Akomolede, in her judgment, also observed that the marriage had broken down irretrievably. She ruled that the custody of the four children produced by the union should be awarded to the petitioner. She also ruled that the respondent should be paying N2,000 as the monthly feeding allowance on each of the children. The court president granted access to the respondent to see his children. Amaka, 36, a resident of Oke-Bola in Ado-Ekiti, had told the court during its proceedings that her husband usually accused her of returning from her man friend’s house. Amaka confessed to having a man friend, adding that it was her husband who pushed her into it, because he did not take care of her. The mother of four alleged, that, her husband was having sex with a mad woman that came for deliverance, when he took her out for prayer. She said, that when the lady got well, she confessed to sleeping with Friday, and that she claimed to have got a husband. Amaka noted, that, her husband had threatened her life severally, adding that at a time, he threatened that he would hire thugs and would pay them N5,000 to kill her. The respondent, a resident of No. 8, Iremo Street, in Odo-Ado, Ado-Ekiti, debunked all the allegations levelled against him by his wife, describing them as fabricated. Friday described his wife as an adulterous woman, adding that she would leave his house to sleep in another man’s house for three days. The respondent said, that, he was in support of the separation.
