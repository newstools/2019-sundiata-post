Terri is interested in settling with an African man and she was written to a relationship adviser and blogger, Joro Olumofin to post her request. She wants a man who is not younger than 28 years and she is not really concerned about looks. Once you can provide a valid proof of identification, then you are good to go. If youâ€™re interested in meeting Terri, send a mail to joromofindating@gmail.com with proof of ID. Source
