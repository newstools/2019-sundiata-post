Read excerpts from the interview below: What do you love most about your husband (Ned Nwoko)? His honesty. He’s the most honest person I have ever met. In short, I love his honesty. What’s the next level for you (Regina Daniel) as an actress? Business, producing, directing and of course, Hollywood. What are the things marriage has robbed you of? I can’t think of anything because when I was single, my life was always about acting, schooling and I didn’t have time for a party but now that I’m married I could go out for parties. I can even say I’m more privileged to have more opportunities now to do things than when I was single. Can you (Regina Daniels) leave acting at the behest of your husband? The question is, will he ask me to leave acting? First of all, I never thought about that but the man I married will never ask me to leave what I love. Source
