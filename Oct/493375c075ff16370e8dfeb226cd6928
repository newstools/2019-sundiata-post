…Tasks Nigerian Youths To Emulate Her Determination By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja – Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege
has congratulated Nigeria’s athlete, Ese Brume for her outstanding
performance at the just concluded IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar,
United Arab Emirates (UAE). Omo-Agege said by her performance, Brume has not only made Delta
State in particular proud but also Nigeria and Africa in general. According to the  congratulatory message from his Media Office,
the Deputy President of The Senate commended what he called her optimism,
determination and hardwork. Although the Cyprus-based Ese Brume clinched bronze medal in the
long jump event at the IAAF World Championships, Omo-Agege insisted that
“Her bronze medal feels like gold to the Nigerian people and we hope she
inspires an entire generation of Nigerian athletes to win more medals at the
world championships in the future”. While descibing her as a role model, Omo-Agege tasked Nigerian
youth to emulate her determination, hardwork and can-do attitude. The senator said: “Her (Brume’s) determination and sheer
doggedness in holding her nerves to win the bronze medal (Nigeria’s maiden
medal at the world championships) while competing with the world’s best
athletes in the women’s long jump gives us absolute joy and pride. “Ese had wept profusely while winning the gold medal at the
African games held earlier in 2019 because she recalled being told four years
earlier while she sustained an injury that she would not be able to jump
anymore. However, her optimism, determination, and hardwork, which are
attributes akin to the Nigerian spirit, helped her overcome this obstacle and
she has bounced back stronger. “The good people of Delta State, and Nigeria at large
congratulate her and are extremely proud of her achievement and inspiring
comeback. Ese Brume is a role model for Nigerian youth who would be aiming to
emulate her determination and hardwork”.
