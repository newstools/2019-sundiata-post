By Lucy Osuizigbo Awka – The Anambra Vehicle Inspection Office (VIO) said on Wednesday tha it generated N227 million from issuance of Certificates of Road Worthiness between January and September. Mr Raphael Okoye, General Supervisor, Anambra VIO, said this at the Bilateral Engagement and 2020 Budget Defence with the State House of Assembly Committee on Transportation in Awka. “Issuance of Certificate of Road Worthiness is one of the ways we generate revenue for the state and I can tell you that in nine months,  that is between January and September 2019,  we generated about N227 million. “We believe we can generate more revenue for the state if other avenues can be  explored. “We feel there is another revenue window we have not been utilising, which is having weigh bridges at every entry point in the state to identify and arrest vehicles for overloading. “We can have weigh bridges and arrest vehicles for overloading.  It’s a source of revenue,” he said. Okoye identified lack of operational vehicles and tow trucks across the state as one of the challenges faced by the vehicle inspection office. “The last time seven vehicles were bought was when  the Anambra VIO was reconstituted in 2014. Now they are very old; so we need new vehicles and tow trucks. “We also need tyre clamps and cameras to video our operations when arrests are made as well as training of officers,” he said. Dr Tim Ifedioranma representing Njikoka I Constituency, noted that the VIO could generate more revenue for the state if enough fund was appropriated to it.
