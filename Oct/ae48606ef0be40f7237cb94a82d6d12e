￼￼ENUGU –  The Enugu State Police Command has arrested a pastor with the Royal Prince Prophetic Ministry, Chukwuemeka Eze, for allegedly killing his girlfriend, Ogechukwu Ogbodo, over her refusal to buy him a tricycle. According to Southern City News, the cleric had been in a relationship with Ms Ogbodo, a native of Amagunze in Nkanu-East Local Government Area of the state for five years. The deceased, who used to be resident at the Railway Quarters, was a recharge card sales agent. She was said to have returned home on July 15, 2019, with over N2 million which she intended to deposit in the bank the following day. Eze, however, discovering that his girlfriend returned home with a huge sum, was alleged to have visited and killed her. Enugu State police spokesman, Ebere Amaraizu, confirmed that Eze had been arrested by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. Mr Amaraizu said the preacher, after allegedly killing his girlfriend, made away with the money and title documents to the deceased’s landed property. He said Eze immediately used the money to procure musical instruments and renovated his church. The spokesman also said the cleric confessed that the deceased refused to buy him a tricycle though she had been buying tricycles for people in the community on hire purchase. Amaraizu said the preacher would soon be prosecuted. (qed.ng)
