Residents of Ubahu community, Nanka, Orumba North Local Government Area of Anambra State, were on Thursday, October 24, 2019 sent residents scampering for safety as homes, farmlands, economic trees and major access roads were destroyed by a devastating landslide. News Express gathered that the landslide was triggered following a downpour. Nanka habours multiple gully erosion sites that keep the community on its toes during rainy seasons. Speaking to journalists, an indigene of the area and an environmental activist, Ikenna Ezenekwe, said the fear of further landslides remained a constant reminder to the villagers. He said that without help, the erosion may further worsen. Mr. Ezenekwe recalled that a landslide swept the home of Madam Bridget Eze in 2018, adding: “In 2010, the gully became more aggressive as a result of increased unregulated storm flow. Within the short period of 2009 to 2019, Obeagu gully erosion doubled its original size. “The village leaders in an effort to ameliorate the situation took up self-action. They started by providing land for some of the families that lost their lands. They embarked on opening another access road to Umudala village and to install new electric power lines.” As at the time of filing this report, the Anambra State Government was yet to react to the landslide
