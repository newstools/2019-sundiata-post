When dealing with your teenage kid, never you allow EMOTIONS to take the place of TRUST. This age of internet has proven that these kids know more than we think they do. If you have suspicions, do not hide under the CONVENIENCE of SELF-DECEPTION accentuated by that common lie: I-TRUST-MY-SON/DAUGHTER. No ma. No sir. Confront your suspicions and deal with them. Sit him/her down and ask questions and also do your own discreet findings. These kids mean a world to us but we also need to know that blatant display of emotions (when we should be strict and seek help if necessary) will NEVER help them. You may tell your son/daughter that he/she is too young to be on Facebook. But he/she may ACTUALLY be there under a pseudonym and won’t upload any personal pictures. I am talking from personal experience. What I did was to seize the phone and ban use of android until higher institution. And I RELIGIOUSLY kept to it. Easy access to education and internet nowadays have shown that between the ages of 14 and 25, ADVENTURISM is the order of the day. And that is the threshold where life is either MADE or RUINED. Do not assume things will take care of themselves. They hardly do. And by the time we want to take charge, it is always too late… Source: Facebook
