The appeal court has sacked Dino Melaye from the Senate and has asked for a rerun. Shortly after, the Kogi West politician took to Twitter to react. See his tweet below: I just lost my election at the Appeal Court and Fresh election ordered. In all things I give God the Praise. He who started a good thing will definitely complete it. I ask my supporters to be law abiding as we shall always overcome. To God be the Glory.
