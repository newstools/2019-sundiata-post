The Bayelsa State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has derided the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, following his allegations that the PDP was stockpiling arms ahead of the November 16 governorship election. The State Chairman of the PDP, Moses Cleopas, said in a statement on Sunday that Oshiomhole and other leaders of the APC were making allegations as a plot to justify deployment of soldiers to rig the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state. Cleopas said that the people of the state would resist any attempt by the APC to deploy soldiers to rig the gubernatorial election. The PDP Chairman called on Nigerians to ignore the APC allegation which according to him, were inspired by the desperation of the party to cause mischief. Cleopas, said that it was absurd and ridiculous for the National Chairman of the ruling party, Oshiomhole and his Deputy, Yekini Nabena, to make wild allegations about arms stockpiling against the PDP. Cleopas said that Oshiomhole would recall how he was hurried out of Bayelsa State to avoid being kidnapped by the leaders of the APC during their primaries in 2015. Cleopas said that the botched attempt to kidnap the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of the Special Anti Robbery Squad, Mr. Kola Okunola, by APC militia in Brass for refusing to rig election in February showed clearly that the APCâ€™s politics in Bayelsa was anchored on violence. The Party Chairman alleged that the APC colluded with compromised soldiers to kill Government House Photographer, Mr. Reginald Dei and a PDP Ward Leader at Oweikorogha, Southern Ijaw Local Government Area, in February, this year without any arrest or prosecution. He challenged Oshiomhole to disclose to the well meaning Nigeria public where the said arms were imported from, who imported them and the armoury. Source: The Nation
