A former vice-chancellor of the African University in Bayelsa State, Professor Valentine Aleto, has been abducted by gunmen along Elegbeka/Ipele Road in Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State. Professor Aleto was said to be travelling from Yenagoa in his personal vehicle along the road at about 6:45 am on Thursday. The suspected kidnappers reportedly appeared on the road and forced him into a shop before he was taken into the bush. Channels Television gathered that the abductors have demanded N20 million as ransom from the victim’s family to release him. Sources said by the time the police got the information about the incident, the assailants had escaped with the professor. However, the security operatives have recovered the former vice chancellor’s vehicle to the Police Station in Ifon. The police authorities in Ondo State confirmed the incident to Channels Television. According to the Command’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Femi Joseph, the police have commenced investigations into the incident. He said “Yes, I can confirm to you that one professor traveling in his personal car was kidnapped along the Elegbeka Area in Ose Local Government Area of the State.” But Joseph said he would get the details of the incident from the Divisional Police Officer in the area. He explained that as soon as they got the information, the Command dispatched men of the Special Anti-Kidnapping Squad to the scene of the crime. The Command’s spokesman added that full-scale investigation was ongoing and was hopeful that the professor would soon be rescued. (Channels TV)
