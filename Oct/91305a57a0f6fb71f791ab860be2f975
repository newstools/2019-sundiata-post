Former Plantashun Boiz label mate, Blackface reacts bitterly as Faze performs plantashun boiz group song together with 2face as his recently concluded event held in Abuja after their conversation. Blackface took to his Instagram page and react to their recent performance on stage without his awareness; “I hate to do this but You fall my hand again @fazealone After our conversation you went on to perform #plantashunboiz @plantashunboiz1 songs with my contributions with 2Face at his event ? When is this going to stop ?You both sound like artists that lost it, what examples are you both portraying going on stage without rehearsals? You both don’t sync and it makes my hard work look poor, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE I no go beg again…. I just uploaded our convo for the world to know the facts of what’s going on with all #theconspiracytheory #Watchme #linkinmybio #MRBFN” Source
