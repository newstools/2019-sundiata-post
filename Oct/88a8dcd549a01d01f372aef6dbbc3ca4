Charles Anazodo, a veteran TV journalist took to Twitter on Thursday to share how Tiwa Savage “walked pass” and didn’t say “hello” to him at a radio station. But Tiwa Savage didn’t take it lightly with him. See the tweets below: @TiwaSavage was a guest on @THEBEAT999FM earlier today,arrived and walked past @kallyjoe and i, and didn't have the courtesy to say hello. I guess being a superstar gives you the right to be discourteous. Then she replied. First of all I’m sure you saw me rushing to the studio because I was late for my interview plus I had a hat on, second I’m glad I didn’t say hi because who are you to think you can’t say hi first https://t.co/Ut1x1Xup6u And Charles obviously felt hurt by that. I'm nobody ,just another human being. Cheers. https://t.co/x6zVRtyhFC
