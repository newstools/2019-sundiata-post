By Modupe Oremule Lagos – Fadekemi Olude, the first Nigerian female to cross the finish line at the just-concluded 21km Onitsha City Marathon on Monday, said that she would not rest on her oars to ensure she realised her dream. Olude told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that her target was to be heard of in the world, as one of the best long distance runners. “By God’s grace, my name will be heard all over the world; I will go to Olympics, World Championships and any other competitions. “These are my targets in the next five years but at the same time, I love to get married, and then continue my races because it’s in my blood. “I am trusting God to help me achieve my goals,” she said. The Ogun indigene, who is also a race-walker, said that the endurance gained while running the marathon has helped her improve on her race-walk. She also said that the only thing she needed done was perfecting her techniques. NAN reports that Kenya’s Bernard Sang and Esther Chesand were overall winners in the male and female categories respectively. Emmanuel Pam and Fadekemi Olude, were first Nigerians to breast the tape in the male and female categories respectively. William Amposah from Ghana, who finished fifth overall, was the first West African to breast the tape, while Augustine Nwafor, was the first athlete from Onitsha, to finish the race. Olude emerged in the second position in the Nigerian Female Category of the 2019 Access Bank Lagos City Marathon. (NAN)
