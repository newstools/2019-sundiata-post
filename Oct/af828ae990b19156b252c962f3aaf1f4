President of Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has called for prayers for the United Statesâ€™ President, Donald Trump. Mr Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry from House Democrats over a July 25 phone call in which the US leader asked Ukraine president, Vlodimir Zelinskiy, to investigate Joe Biden, a likely opponent in the 2020 election. In a tweet on Tuesday, Suleman said that the impeachment inquiry was unnecessary, calling Trump an imperfect man like everybody else. It's so crazy seeing the way America media fight @realDonaldTrump..now you want to impeach him over a phone call?.I know foolishness is free but must you have a overdose of it?.The man is imperfect we all are..pls let this man be.all Christians please pray for @realDonaldTrump.. In the US, it is illegal to ask foreign entities for help winning election. Trump says it is a witch-hunt and he did nothing wrong.
