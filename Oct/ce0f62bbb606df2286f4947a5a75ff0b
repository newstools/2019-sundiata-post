•Nnamdi Kanu, leader of IPOB By Pamela Eboh AWKA – Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has called on traditional rulers pleading for his pardon by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari in order for him to return for his mother’s burial to desist from such pursuit, saying that he did not solicit their assistance. He made the call on the heels of social media reports that some monarchs are pleading that he should be pardoned to come home and bury his deceased mother. Kanu said that with or without him, his mother would be buried, noting that what would gladden his mother’s spirit is the actualisation of the sovereign state of Biafra. The IPOB leader said on Sunday: “I didn’t send or beg anyone to lobby the federal government of Nigeria on my behalf and will never do that. And even if such request is granted, I will not honour it because the cabals in Also Rock are not to dictate things for me. “What I can assure you is that my mother must be buried. When she was alive she told me to do everything within my power to restore Biafra. I may attend her burial or I may not but certainly the burial must be done.” Kanu’s mother died in a German hospital on August 30, 2019 as a result of the shock she sustained from the attack in their Afaraukwu home in Umuahia, Abia State, on September 14, 2017.
