By Ishaq Zaki Gusau – Alhaji Kabiru Maipalace, the legislator representing Gusau/Tsafe federal constituency in Zamfara, says he is sponsoring the training of 100 women from the constituency in poultry farming. Maipalace made this known in Gusau while speaking with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday. The lawmaker said that the beneficiaries were currently undergoing the training under his women empowerment project. According to Maipalace, after the training, all the beneficiaries will be supported with capital and 100 chickens each as support to start their poultry farming businesses. “I am planning to expand the programme to train additional 500 beneficiaries including other empowerment skills. “You must be aware of the 120 women we empowered with skills and empowerment tools three months ago in Tsafe local government area,” he said. Maipalace said that apart from youths and women empowerment, “education is my second cardinal objective”. “Under my education support project, I sponsored over 1,000 secondary school leavers comprising male and females, who failed their Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination (SSCE) to rewrite the examinations. “I learned that SSCE failure is one of the major education challenges in the state as many students that failed WASSCE and NECO could not go further in their education. “I decided to intervene in this sector because most of the parents have financial difficulties to sponsor their children to rewrite examinations,” he explained. Maipalace said that students from tertiary institutions also benefitted from his free education projects. (NAN)
