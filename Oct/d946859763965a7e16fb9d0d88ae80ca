Kogi Deputy Governor Elder Simon Achuba has been impeached. He was impeached by the House of Assembly shortly after it received report of a judicial panel of enquiry set up by the Kogi State Chief Judge Justice Nasir Ajanah. House Leader, Hassan Bello Abdulahi, representing Ajaokuta state constituency, said Achuba was impeached following consideration of the report of the John Bayeshea-led committee. Abdulahi explained said the report was accepted with lawmakers unanimously agreeing to impeach Achuba and “he therefore stands impeached.” Speaker Mathew Kolawole on Friday received the report following which the House went into a closed-door session to discuss its contents. The committee, which was inaugurated on August 26, probed allegations of gross misconduct leveled against the Deputy Governor. Achuba accused Governor Yahaya Bello of withholding his salaries and imprests since 2017. But the government dismissed the allegation as untrue during hearing by the committee.
