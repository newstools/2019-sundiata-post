We all like to show our level of CONNECTION and POWER when we have issues with others. We only complain when we are at receiving end of such highhandedness. Davido only showed we may never be able exorcise the ghost of military hangover. Till tomorrow, many of us still go to barracks to call our soldier friends to help us handle a matter that is STRICTLY CIVIL. I mean like someone owing us or not delivering good ordered on time. A guy once brought naval ratings to come and beat up his brother-in-law for maltreating his wife who happened to be his (guy’s) sister. What Davido did was DESPICABLE and NAUSEATING. He or any other person has no right to handcuff anybody. But what was the difference between that and that brought Air Force recruits to come and beat up your mechanic for not fixing your car on time? These are things we see and hear of everyday We all like condemning on social media what we will do in our private lives without batting an eyelid. Ours is a society in search of its lost soul… Source: Facebook
