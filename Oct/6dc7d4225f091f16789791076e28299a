Liverpool midfielder, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has admitted that he found it difficult to celebrate after scoring for his side against Arsenal during the Reds’ Carabao Cup win on Wednesday at Anfield due to the respect he has for the Gunners. Arsenal led the Premier League leaders 2-1 and 4-2 on Wednesday night, but the game finished 5-5 after 90 minutes. Divock Origi’s 94th-minute acrobatic goal sent the tie to penalties and Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher saved Dani Ceballos’ effort to clinch a 5-4 shootout win for Jurgen Klopp’s side. “Really proud of the team tonight, especially the young boys and how we all kept going right until the end! Anfield atmosphere unbelievable as always!“Hard not celebrate that one, but all respects to my former club,” the 26-year-old England international wrote on Twitter. Source
