By Ahmed UbandomaAbuja – The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) on Tuesday said it has introduced the Hajj savings scheme for intending pilgrims for 2020 exercise. The Head of Media and Public Affairs of NAHCON, Mrs Fatima Usara, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja.Usara said the idea was to provide an avenue for the low income earners that wished to perform Hajj in the future to deposit their money with the commission from time-to-time before the due date for Hajj. She however said that the commission did not fix a minimum amount for the first deposit. “NAHCON is yet to fix amount for the first deposit by intending pilgrims because discussions are ongoing to determine the minimum amount that intending pilgrims will first deposit before the subsequent payment into the planned Hajj savings account,” she said. The NAHCON spokesperson also said the depositors were at liberty to choose the period of time for their savings before the time of Hajj. NAN reports that NAHCON had earlier commenced review of 2019 Hajj and Umrah activities with a view to improving its operations ahead of 2020 Hajj. NAHCON also requested pilgrims from the 36 states and FCT Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Boards to register their commendations, advice and complaints on the 2019 exercise. (NAN)
