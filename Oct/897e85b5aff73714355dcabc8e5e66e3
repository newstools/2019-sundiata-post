A Nigerian Pastor, Prophet Jeremiah Fufeyin has been mocked by South Africans over his ‘manhood erection restoration miracle’ inside church. Recall that the pastor’s manhood miracle video circulated on the internet with many people shocked at what Christianity has become. South Africans laughed at Nigerians and made a mockery of the Nigerian pastor on social media. Recall that Prophet Jeremiah Omoto Fufeyin had allegedly restored the manhood of one Chris Muabu to normalcy in church after suffering erectile dysfunction. Chris Muabu (formally known as Abdulaziz) born Muslim but converted to Christian had erection dysfunction for over 3 weeks, urinated blood, visited several hospitals was even booked for operation yet to no avail until the prophet allegedly restored the manhood and he had a huge erection in church. A South African man, Tshepiso Masipa: “ppl crying that there is no work & money in SA entertainment industry… here is acting jobs in nigerian churches… i bet the pay is good.” Man’s Not Barry: “These kids calling themselves Men Of God are no longer afraid of God”
