Pop singer, Davido, has revealed that he recorded most of his upcoming album ‘A Good Time’ during his fiancee, Chioma Rowland’s pregnancy. In a statement on Twitter late Friday, the 26-year-old thanked Chioma and his crew for making the album possible. Davido last dropped a studio album in 2012 titled ‘Omo Baba Olowo’. He, however, thanked Chioma for tolerating him during the period of her pregnancy. “Special thanks to God for the grace to finish this project. Second I’d like to thank Chioma my beautiful wife to be. Thank you so much for tolerating me especially through the past 9 months. I recorded most of this album during your pregnancy. You’ve been so patient. I love you,” he said. Special thanks to God for the grace to finish this project. Second I’d like to thank Chioma my beautiful wife to be.
