The director general, also a member of TRCN, said that the council would soon visit NYSC to discuss modalities of the partnership andways to harness other areas of collaboration to boost the capacity of corps members in teaching. He added that the service had renewed partnership with Nigeria Universities Commission (NUC) to add credibility to the NYSC mobilisationprocess and prevent participation of fake graduates from the national service.
