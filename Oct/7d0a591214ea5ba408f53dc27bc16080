Fans of the five remaining housemates have taken to social media to root for their idols, even when voting has officially ended on Friday. However, two of the last five standing housemates, Mercy and Mike, appear to have enormous goodwill on the social media. From writing prayer requests during worship service on Sunday, to detailing how housemates should manage the crisis of not winning the final prize, Twitter has it all. See fans’ tweets as the race to the grand finale heats up: Whether Mercy wins or not, I heard there's a surprise from some team mercy members to Mercy, I can't say what it is 🤭 but it will blow your minds! #bbnaija #BBNaijaFinale Waiting for Mercy's Dress today 😂✔✔#Happy99daysMercy #BBNaijaFinale pic.twitter.com/DXyaSb3RD4 She didn't brag about day 99 but she has made it to day 99..
