Beirut – The Syrian government sharply criticises Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for saying the aim of his country’s current offensive in north-eastern Syria is to fight terrorism and protect Syria’s territorial integrity. “He has come up with statements that are only made by a person dissociated from reality.’’ He speaks about his commitment to the protection of the Syrian people while he is an imprudent killer drenched in the blood of these [Syrian] people, The Syrian state news agency SANA reports, citing a Foreign Ministry source. “Protecting the Syrian people is the mission of the Syrian Arab army and the Syrian state only,’’ it added.
