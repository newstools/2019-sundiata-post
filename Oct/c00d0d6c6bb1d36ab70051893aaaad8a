Singer Rihanna has stated that President Trump is “the most mentally ill human being in America right now.” The singer who graces Vogue Magazine’s November edition called Trump out on gun violence in America. She also cited t two mass shootings in 24 hours back in August 2019. “The fact that it’s classified as something different because of the colour of their skin? It’s a slap in the face. It’s completely racist,” Rihanna said. “Put an Arab man with that same weapon in that same Walmart and there is no way that Trump would sit there and address it publicly as a mental health problem,” said the singer. “The most mentally ill human being in America right now seems to be the president.” Source
