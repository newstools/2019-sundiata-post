The Senior Pastor of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Biodun Fatoyinbo says prayers as he shared new pictures of himself and his family in Milan for vacation. He said the interesting Holy Bible verse below: Gen 21:6 – Sarah said, “God has made me laugh; all who hear [about our good news] will laugh with me.” This week God will give you many reasons to Laugh. And guess what ? The Grace will be highly contagious. Every one around you will catch the “virus”. Fatoyinbo has been having troubling times in Nigeria after he has been accused of raping women. He has several denied the allegations and the case is in court. See more images:
