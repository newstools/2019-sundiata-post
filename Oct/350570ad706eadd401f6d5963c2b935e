•Mark Zuckerberg Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday announced that the organisation “is committing $1 billion to help address the affordable housing crisis in California and other communities where we work. While the technology industry has created many jobs and opportunities, it has also made certain places less affordable to live — and we want to help solve this.” Zuckerberg announced on Facebook that: “As part of today’s commitment, we’re partnering with California Governor Gavin Newsom and the State of California to create up to 20,000 new housing units to help teachers, nurses, first responders and other workers live closer to the communities that need them.    “We’ve been investing in our local communities for some time now and we know money alone is not the answer. That’s why we’re working with people from the community, policy makers, and other companies to address the problem together. It’s an issue that’s really important and I hope we can help find solutions that can work in more cities.”
