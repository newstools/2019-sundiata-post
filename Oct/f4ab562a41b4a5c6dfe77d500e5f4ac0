The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has directed the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, to effect payment of the new minimum wage on or before 31st December, 2019. This was disclosed by the Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige, at the end of FEC meeting chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa Abuja. He also said FEC approved the minimum wage to take effect from 18 April 2019. The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, said FEC approved N1.7 billion for procurement and installation of communication equipment for airport towers in Zaria and Katsina. The equipment, he said, is to ensure safety and efficiency at the airports. He said the completion period for the contract is eight months. Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, disclosed that the FEC approved the use of methanol in the Nigerian economy. He said that methanol is derivable from gas that accompanies crude oil. According to him, it has been profitable for oil companies to flare the gas, which has posed great environmental problems in the country. He said FEC has approved methanol to be used as transportation fuel, cooking. Stressing that it is cheap and safe, he said that it will also check deforestation in the country. He said that the project cannot be achieved overnight as plants have to be built and other logistics put in place. The minister said it will be private- sector driven. The Minister of Communication said FEC approved change of the name of the ministry to be changed to Federal Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy. (The Nation)
