A teenage girl lured a man into a deadly sex trap so her accomplices could steal his BMW, a court heard. Ayodeji Habeeb Azeez, 22, thought he was meeting a 17-year-old girl he had chatted to over Snapchat and social media when he drove to a car park in Anerley, south-east London, on November 4 last year, reports metro.news. Instead he was set upon by a gang of five, including the girl, and suffered 16 stab wounds to his torso, back and shoulders. He managed to stagger out of the car park and collapsed, the Old Bailey was told. He died despite a doctor attempting to perform an emergency operation in the street as police and paramedics struggled to stem the blood loss. Chaise Grey, 24, Brandon Griffith, 20, a 17-year-old male and the 17-year-old girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, all of south London, and Kevin Lusala, 22, of Orpington, Kent, deny murder and conspiracy to rob. The trial continues. New Telegraph
