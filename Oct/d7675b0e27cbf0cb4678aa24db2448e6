This young man here felt like a hero after killing this python last night in the Ajaokuta area of Ogun State. This man Folorunso Olasukanmi by name stumpled upon this python at 8pm yesterday. He then grabbed his motor jack and attacked the reptile. He was seen displaying the animal like a boss and he has promised to prepare a nice delicacy with it. Nowadays, most wild animals killed always end up on the dinning tables of Nigerians. See more images: Source
