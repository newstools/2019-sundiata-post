The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the town was agog with horse riding, cultural dance and exhibition of traditional costumes for the minister. The Minister was received at Jamata village, shortly after Murtala Bridge, by youths, members and officials of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kogi. She, thereafter, proceeded to the palace of Maigari of Lokoja, Alhaji Muhammadu Maikarfi III, to receive royal blessings and counsel to guide her in the national assignment. Addressing residents at the palace, the Minister expressed gratitude to Buhari for finding her worthy to be a member of his cabinet and as minister of FCT. Aliyu also thanked the entire people of Lokoja for polling their resources to organise such a befitting reception for her and her entourage. “This is home to me. So it is not new to me that my people decided to welcome me this way but I will tell you that I am still more delighted that they picked me by surprise and I am proud of them. “This is the first time after a very long time that ministerial appointment is coming to this local government and you can see the whole local government in it entirety is overwhelmed with joy to receive me. “But as they say to whom much is given much is expected, so to me this is a daunting task. There is a responsibility for me to carry on the shoulder to hold the trust for the people and here I am their servant.” Malam Rajab Yabagi, Chairman Central Planning Committee of the celebration, said the entire people of Lokoja remains grateful to Buhari for appointing their daughter as the FCT Minister of state. “We gathered here to celebrate the appointment of one of our own as a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” (NAN)
