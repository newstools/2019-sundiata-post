There wouldn’t  have been a better way to deal with the insecurity,  in my own opinion, it is very commendable,” he stressed.He stressed that smoking out criminals from hide outs in the ungoverned spaces requires the use of technology.By the time the NAF goes all out, such terrorist elements will know it is difficult  to overthrow a legitimate  government,” he added.He said, “A number of people are confused about what uncovered space is.  They narrowed it only to security.“But today,  more issues are related to ungoverned space which  includes development issues,  challenges of poverty,  infrastructure,  inequality gap,  youth related issues,  cross boarder terrorism, infiltration of criminals,  immigrant and among others.“All this has forced the government to take measures,  which includes of  recent the shutdown of our boarders.“The National Security Adviser has been speaking about ungoverned spaces.  These are places where a number of miscreants are hiding. ” he addedBogoro also pointed out that more inclusive governance and government that  provide security  for citizens,  infrastructures,  education and rights to all would tackle the problem of ungoverned spaces.On his part, the Guest of Honour, Maj.-Gen.
