By Kolade Adeyemi KANO â€“ The Managing Director of Kano Zoological Garden, Alhaji Usman Gwadabe, has announced that a team of experts has captured the escaped lion from the zoo around the ancient city. The escape of the lion from the Zoological Garden at about 9.00 pm on Saturday night threw inhabitants in the area into panic. Many of them ran helter skelter to avoid possible attack of the escaped lion. On Sunday morning, the ever-busy zoo and its environs were deserted as shops, filling stations, including the popular Ado Bayero Shopping Mall were under lock and key. The lion, which was captured around the city area, was said to have behaved itself without attacking or attempting to cause any havoc. The Managing Director said the lion has been taken back to the zoo and urged residents to go about their normal business activities. (The Nation)
