The Lagos State police have arrested and arraigned a 29-year-old man who disguises as a prostitute to defraud unsuspecting club-goers. Victor Monday who was arrested by police officers from Mushin Police Station for giving no genuine reason for being out by 12am at Ogunmokun Street, was in a female costume waiting for “a client” by the roadside when he was nabbed. . He was kept in the female cell until he got busted by a policeman on inspection. His beards aroused suspicion and a search revealed that he wore a wig, makeup and also had padded breasts. A police source said he blamed his fraudulent acts on not being employed. . “His mode of operation was to go to clubs at night and look for men he would spend the night with while disguising like a woman. He would dance around to attract men to himself. Whoever is interested in spending the night with him would approach him. .
“He would collect some money from his unsuspecting victim as part payment for his service and have fun on his bill. While they were drinking and wining, he would tell the man that he wanted to urinate and use that opportunity to run away. He said he made between N7,000 and N10,000 per night,” the source said. Confessing to the crime, the Rivers State indigene said he went into crime in 2018, got arrested by the police but secured his freedom after some his church members secured his bail. He said, “I came to Lagos last year and was squatting around. When it was night, I would look for a hidden place to dress like a woman and go to any club to dance as a woman. Men who have feelings for me would give me money, but I don’t follow them to hotels. I managed to run away. . “At times, I made N8,000 per day. I was going to a nightclub on September 15 when police arrested me. I told them my name is Joy, but later one of them discovered that I am a man. I do this because I don’t have a job.” Source
