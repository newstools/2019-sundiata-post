A senior lecturer in the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Dr. Boniface Igbeneghu, has been exposed in a BBC SexForGrades documentary. The 13-minute documentary published on Monday was centered on Unilag and the University of Ghana. BBC Africa Eye Reporter, Kiki Mordi, who conducted the investigations, said they took the move due to the clamour to expose such lecturers. After interviewing several students who had been abused, BBC Africa Eye sent undercover journalists posing as students to lecturers who were in the habit of harassing students. The journalists were sent to the lecturers wearing hidden cameras and carrying a panic button to alert waiting colleagues in case the situation gets out of hand. Igbeneghu, who is also the head pastor of a Foursquare Gospel Church in Lagos, on his first meeting with one of the journalists who posed as a 17-year-old admission seeker, commented on her appearance. He revealed that there was a location inside the UNILAG Staff club known as ‘cold room’ where lecturers take female students for sexual pleasures. “Do you know that you are a very beautiful girl,” Igbeneghu asked her. “Do you know that I am a pastor and I’m in my fifties. What will shock you is that even at my age now, if I want a girl of your age – a 17-year-old, all I need is to sweet tongue her and put some money in her hand and I’ll get her.” BBC Africa Eye said that despite repeated requests, the lecturer failed to react to the allegations of sexual harassment. It also said that UNILAG authorities dissociated itself from the lecturer’s actions, stating that it has zero-tolerance policy on sexual harassment. But the institution refused to comment on the alleged ‘cold room.’ Another lecturer from the College of Education in Ghana, Dr. Paul Kwame, was also indicted in the documentary.
