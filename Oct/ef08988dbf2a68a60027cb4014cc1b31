•Ex-PSC Chairman Okiro ABUJA – Immediate past Chairman of the Police Service Commission (PSC), Sir Mike Okiro, on Thursday led other former Inspectors-General of Police (IGPs) to wade into the feud between incumbent IGP, Mohammed Adamu, and the PSC, presently chaired by Alhaji Musliu Smith, also a former IGP. The quarrel between the police and its supervising agency has not only attracted bad press but also led to a court case by the PSC while also putting on hold recruitment, promotion and retirement in the Nigeria Police Force (NPF). A competent source close to both camps informed News Express that they were reconciled at a meeting held in Abuja and chaired by Okiro. “The meeting held from 2pm and lasted for about three and a half hours. The agenda of the meeting was the reconciling Alhaji Smith and IGP Adamu,” the source said. He disclosed that the meeting “attended by more than five former IGPs” prevailed on the feuding parties to sheathe the sword as the resultant negative publicity “is denting the image of the police.” Smith was said to have been accompanied to the meeting by two 2 PSC commissioners while IGP Adamu attended with an undisclosed number of the Police Management Team. The meeting, according to the source, achieved a measure of success. “It was agreed that the PSC should lift the embargo on promotion and retirement in the Police Force with immediate effect while the recruitment exercise remains in place since the matter is already in court,” the source, who asked not to be identified, disclosed.
