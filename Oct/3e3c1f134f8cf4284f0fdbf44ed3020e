ABUJA – The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has finally approved the use of hijab for female Muslim corps members. It, however, ruled out provision of the hijab by the NYSC management, leaving that for those who need them to procure them by themselves. An exclusive story on this by ThePUNCH on Tuesday morning also quoted the NYSC management as stating that only three types of dressing used for different occasions would be acceptable for corps members. The paper quoted a document exclusively obtained by its correspondent in Abuja as reading: “The modes of dressing for corps members are classified into three categories, which are used for different occasions. One, within the camp during the orientation programme, their normal attire, except otherwise directed, consists of a pair of white shorts with a white vest and white canvas shoes and socks. “Two, for ceremonial purposes, the proper dressing is crested vest on top of a pair of Khaki trousers with a pair of jungle boots and socks with the trouser folded inside the socks. The belt and the Fez cap are to match. “Three, for Man O’War activities at the camp and Community Development Service programmes, they are expected to appear in a jacket and trousers with the plain white vest inside, the jungle boot and the Fez cap, as well as a customised belt to match. “On the use of the hijab, the NYSC does not issue the hijab as part of its uniform. However, the NYSC management allows corps members to use a white hijab that drops at shoulder level for religious purposes.”
