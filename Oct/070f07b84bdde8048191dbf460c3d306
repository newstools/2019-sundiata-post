By Leonard Okachie Umuahia – Kelvin Amaefule, a professor of Animal Nutrition and Biochemistry, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike in Abia, has advised Nigerians to consume more animal protein products than plant products.Amaefule gave the advice on Wednesday during the university’s 46th inaugural lecture, entitled “Man shall not live by bread alone: prophecy and practice”.He said that an increase in the consumption of animal protein, including meat, egg, fish and milk, would allow an increase in body size, brain development and smaller gastrointestinal tract.According to the don, such consumption will allow energy to be used by bigger brain without loss of agility and sociality.He said, “Individuals who consume more of animal protein than plant products are not likely to develop high blood pressure, atherosclerosis or cardio-vascular diseases and high blood sugar (glucose) level.”He said that the consumption of more plant products than animal protein would rather lead to higher risk of high blood sugar level.Amaefule said that the demand for animal protein, such as meat, egg, fish and milk, is very high in Nigeria but supply and consumption were highly limited.The don said that his research focus had been on monogastric animal species, such as poultry, pigs and rabbits, because the species were amenable to Nigeria’s ecological, socio-cultural conditions and circumstances.The professor also called for structural and institutional changes in government policies in order to stimulate income and employment opportunities in the rural and peri-urban areas.“This will improve resource use efficiency at all levels of animal protein production and ensure availability of cheap and affordable animal products to the populace,” he said.The Vice Chancellor of the institution, Prof. Francis Otunta, who was represented at the lecture by his Deputy (Academics), Prof. Madu Iwe, thanked Amaefule for his thorough research and thought-provoking lecture.
