President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday observed the weekly two raka’at jumaat prayer at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Among those that joined him at the jumaat prayer were presidential aides, some cabinet ministers and former governor of Zamfara, Abdulaziz Yari as well as Senator Kabir Gaya. The jumaat prayer however witnessed unprecedented number of faithful. They seemed to have stormed the Villa mosque to confirm the authenticity or otherwise of the social media reports claiming that President Buhari would have wedding fatiha for a second wife. The social media reports had claimed that President Buhari would get married on Friday to the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq. But that didn’t happen at the Presidential Villa on Friday. The Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, has dispelled the rumour that went viral on the social media. According to him, the rumour was false. He stressed that the rumour was a deceptive manoeuvre by those who fabricated the news. Noting that the news was far from the truth, he said that no such marriage is taking place at the Presidential Villa. (The Nation) Source News Express
