A member of the National Youth Service Scheme, Stephen Teru, serving in Cross River State has been applauded by Nigerians after his act of kindness went viral on social media. The NYSC member used his capentry skills to construct free desks for pupils of the school where he is teaching. Stephen Teru shared photos on facebook and wrote: “To God be the glory! I volunteered my skill to produce desks, tables, benches and shelves for the comfort of over 80 students and pupils of the two public schools (Community
Secondary School and St. Georges Primary School) in my host community -Old Netim, Akamkpa LGA. Cross River State. I must in a very special way appreciate the good people of the community for their support. Big thanks to my ever supportive principal Mr Emmanuel Eni Sir, you are too much! My NYSC Inspector, Mr Ubong Effanga, thank you Sir! You’ve been a great source of motivation to us all. All my friends and colleagues, thanks for being there. My family at Jos, this is for you!” Source
