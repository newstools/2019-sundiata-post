President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday received some of the ministers who served with him when he was Military Head of State between January 1984 and August 1985. The President, who went down the memory lane, recalled how we got things done then during his military administration. Buhari was military head of state from December 31, 1983 to August 27, 1985, after taking power in a military coup d’état. A statement issued by the Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity), Femi Adesina, said Buhari, who received the guests as State House, Abuja, pledged to carry everyone along on his last lap as a democratically elected leader. He thanked the former ministers “for being consistently in touch” and particularly lauded the military for building Abuja as new Federal Capital Territory for the country. A minute’s silence was observed in memory of those who had passed on among them. The leader of the delegation, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, who served as Minister of External Affairs, said the team came to congratulate the President on his achievements in security, foreign affairs, anti-corruption, education, and many others. Gambari recalled, “We were appointed 35 years and nine months ago. “Eighteen of us were sworn in. Your leadership was firm, but you also gave us free hand to operate. ” You knew what each person was doing. We will never forget the opportunity you gave us. We remain patriots.” Gambari commended the President on the newly constituted Economic Advisory Council, adding that the same should be considered for security and foreign affairs. Other former ministers in the team were Maj. Gen. Muhammed Magoro (retd) (Internal Affairs); Dr. Emmanuel Nsan (Health), Ibrahim Yakima Abdullah (Education); and Brig-Gen. Ahmed Abdullahi (retd) (Communications). Source
