Former BBNaija housemate, Khafi has finally received N500,000 after explaining to musician, MC Galaxy which she couldn‚Äôt make it to the collection point. Recall that Cindy, Frodd and Omashola had also received money from MC Galaxy. The reality show star explained that she was stuck in traffic that was why she couldn‚Äôt make it to the Island where Laura Ikeji‚Äôs store is located. According to her, she was stuck in traffic after a photoshoot. She wrote as she shared her video: Thank you to everyone who supported me and suggested me to get the money offered yesterday by Mc Galaxy and thank you for the opportunity sir. Unfortunately I was not able to get from the mainland to the island due to serious traffic and was still on my way when the money was redistributed. I don‚Äôt take it lightly that people went out of their way to suggest me, I appreciate you! Please keep supporting me in every way you can. I also want to congratulate Cindy who was given the money instead. I pray for many more opportunities for blessings for all of us. Shortly after she received the money, Khafi took to Instagram to thank MC Galaxy while also disclosing that she never expected it. She further revealed that she will be splitting the money between her fans and getting an apartment in Lagos. She wrote ‚ÄúWow I genuinely didn‚Äôt expect this! Thank you so much Sir!!! The same way I have been blessed, I will bless some of my #Khafinators from this, the rest will go towards me finding a place to stay in Lagos!
