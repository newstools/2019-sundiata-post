By Constance Imasuen Abuja – Electricity Generation Companies (GenCos), comprising gas-fired and hydro stations said that they could not generate 2,352.5 megawatts of electricity on Wednesday due to unavailability of distribution infrastructure. This is contained in a daily energy report by the Advisory Power Team, office of the Vice President, a copy of which was obtained by News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Thursday. The report also attributed the 2,352 .5 megawatts not generated to high frequency. It also noted that 1.55 megawatts of electricity was not generated due to unavailability of transmission infrastructure during the period. Similarly, it said that 1,551 megawatts was not generated due to unavailability of gas.

The report revealed that the power sector lost an estimated over N1.94 billion due to insufficient gas supply, distribution and transmission infrastructure. On sector reform/activities, it said that the dominant constraint for Wednesday was high frequency resulting from unavailability of distribution infrastructure.
