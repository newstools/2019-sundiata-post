I honestly wouldn’t have bothered with this issue but for the number of well-meaning people who seem genuinely incredulous that Buhari could have extramarital affairs (as if he were some unerring saint) and, worse, reward his mistresses with appointments. Buhari’s womanizing is well-known to both his former military colleagues and people who have been politically associated with him since 2003. It doesn’t bother me, frankly, because we all have our weaknesses. I’m only concerned because he allowed his weakness to influence his politics and policies. Someone who knows Buhari intimately shared this excerpt of page 10 of Dr. Dele Sobowale’s book titled, LETTING A THOUSAND FLOWERS BLOOM (IBRAHIM B. BABANGIDA 1985 – 1992) and added that it faithfully captured Buhari. Sobowale wrote: “Buhari never drank nor smoked. His only known vice was women. He must have been some sort of a sexual athlete. One officer who served with him in two stations had this to say: ‘You can leave your money, bottle of hot drinks or packets of cigarettes with Buhari, go away for several months and return and find nothing would be missing. But leave your girlfriend or sister with him and you might return to find her pregnant.’ That might be an exaggeration but he had that reputation.” Source: Facebook
