An improvised explosive device killed 10 Kenyan police on Saturday when it exploded during their patrol along the Kenya-Somalia border. The Kenyan military and the police confirmed the fatalities of the roadside blast in the town of Garissa, northern Kenya, to the local media. According to a statement by the Kenyan police, preliminary investigations indicated that the attack was carried out by Somalia-based insurgents group al-Shabaab. The statement added: “The vehicle they were traveling on was severely damaged, reinforcement were sent to the area to pursue the attackers.” A senior police officer told Anadolu Agency from Garissa on condition of anonymity due to restrictions to speaking to the media said that “the police officers were part of the General Service Unit stationed at Harehare in Garissa.” In June, 12 border police officers were killed in a similar incident close to where the attack happened.
