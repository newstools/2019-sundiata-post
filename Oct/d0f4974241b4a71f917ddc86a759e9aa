Following the backlash that followed their claim, the two sisters who accused Davido of impregnating one of them have apologized to the singer, asserting that they only did what they did to congratulate the singer on the birth of his first son, in a unique way. According to the sisters, they only wanted to get his attention through the video, and nothing more than that. They also criticized people who believed their false accusation against the singer, pointing out that they are nothing close to the kind of girls the singer would love to mingle with. The girls further added that, they had no intention to hurt the singer, or put him in bad light, as they respect the fact that he is a married man, and a great musician. This apology is coming barely 24 hours after the singer vowed to put them in jail till they pay N30billion for damages.
