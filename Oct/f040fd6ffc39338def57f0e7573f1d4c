IBADAN – A former National Chairman of Alliance for Democracy (AD), Senator Mojisoluwa Akinfenwa, is dead. An indigene of Erin Ijesa in Osun State, Akinfenwa, aged 89, died in his Ibadan home, on Thursday. Confirming the death of Akinfenwa to Nigerian Tribune, a former AD chairman in Osun State, Hon Olapade Fakunle, said, the former AD national leader enjoyed good health till he breathed his last. According to him, “Senator Akinfenwa left his Osun home on Monday, but only complained of having malaria symptoms on his way, and as he arrived in Ibadan, he went to his doctor, who asked him to rest after medication. Fakunle said it wasn’t as if he was bedridden, rather, he said he had enjoyed good health all through to his old age. “To us, his complaint wasn’t seen as anything serious as he was not used to falling sick, once he treats malaria, he gets back on his feet. “But, sadly, while he was observing his bed rest at home, and we expected him to be back, he died in his home, on Thursday.” Fakunle, also a former national publicity secretary of AD, described Akinfenwa as “a great leader, who lived an exemplary life as a father and politician.” (Nigerian Tribune)
