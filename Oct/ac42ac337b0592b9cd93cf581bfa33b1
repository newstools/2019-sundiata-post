ASUU is threatening to go on strike if the government insists on implementing the new IPPIS salary payment system on lecturers (a system that has already been implemented for all federal civi service workers). This putrid, outmoded union wants to go on strike if its members (whom, God forbid, should be subjected to any transparency and accountability mechanism) are not treated as special workers separate from others. This same union threatened to go on strike if the last senate passed the higher education sexual harassment bill. Their threat worked and the bill died. If there is a bigger example of a trade union that is a threat to the very industry it claims to represent, I have not seen it. If there is a trade union that is a bigger refuge for all manner of misfits, conmen, and predators, and a more determined opponent of progressive change and transparency in our country, I haven’t seen it. The question is, when will ASUU threaten to strike on behalf of the thousands, if not millions, of student-victims of lecturers’ sexual abuses, extortions, and tyrannical treatment of students?
