By Seun Opejobi Abuja (Sundiata Post) – A former Minister of Works, Adeseye Ogunlewe, has opined that Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has achieved more than the late Youba sage, Obafemi Awolowo and MKO Abiola, acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election. Ogunlewe anchored his claim on the number of persons Tinubu has been able to promote from nothing to be governors, ministers and even Vice-President. He maintained that the former Lagos State governor would make a better President if given the opportunity. Speaking with Daily Independent, Ogunlewe said: “Tinubu is the most prominent Yoruba person that has paid his dues and is knowledgeable about the politics of Nigeria. I am confident he can lead Nigeria well if he becomes president. “How can I say that the north will deny Tinubu and he will end up like MKO Abiola? All these people are enemies of progress… Hasn’t he (Tinubu) done more than MKO Abiola? Hasn’t he done more than Awolowo? ”Maybe not in terms of performance but he has more in terms of skills, wisdom. Look at the way he has been able to cover all parts of Nigeria. “Look at the number of people he has been able to promote from nothing to be governors, ministers and even Vice-President. “Believe it or not, whether you like him or you don’t like him, you must give him credit. All those saying negative things are not knowledgeable about Nigerian politics. If you are knowledgeable about Nigerian politics, you should know that you cannot remove the man’s achievements from him.
