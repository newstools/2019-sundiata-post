Her spokesman,Suleiman Haruna, later issued a statement quoting her as saying that she was happy to be back in the country after what she called a “deserved rest.” The statement read, “This morning, First Lady of Nigeria, Mrs Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, returned to the country after a long holiday in the UK.“She arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport at 4.30am via a British Airways flight.“Speaking to reporters on arrival, Mrs Buhari said she was happy to be home after a well-deserved rest.“She confirmed that she was fully rejuvenated to continue the work of improving the health and well-being of women, children and other vulnerable Nigerians.“She used the opportunity to thank her husband, family and well-wishers for their support and encouragement.“On hand to receive her were wives of present and former governors and many associates.” Meanwhile, the Enugu State chapter of the All Progressives Congress on Sunday said the return of Mrs Buhari back to the country had put ‘full stop to fake news.’ The state Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mrs Kate Ofor, said Mrs Buhari’s return had put paid to fake news even as she welcomed her return back to Nigeria.“I wholeheartedly welcome our dear First Lady back to the country. Her elegant return has put full stop to fake news which dominated our public domain. I think we have to not only find legitimate means to curb fake news, but also come to terms that social media have no gatekeeper. Therefore, we must cultivate the culture of sieving the genuine from fake news.” Source
