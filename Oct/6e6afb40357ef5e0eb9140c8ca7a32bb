By Emmanuel Antswen Makurdi – Mr Emmanuel Jime the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the 2019 election in Benue, has said that he will appeal the Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal judgment which upheld Gov. Samuel Ortom’s election. Jime, who was reacting to the judgement on Tuesday, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Makurdi that the tribunal was not fair to him and his party. NAN reports that the Justice Henry Olusiyi-led tribunal had, in a nine- hour judgment on Monday, dismissed Jime’s petition and upheld the election of Ortom. The APC governorship candidate said that the tribunal, in its judgment, failed to give justice to “the suffering Benue masses. “The tribunal did not deliver justice to the suffering people of Benue State. I am determined to get justice for our people. “Accordingly, I have instructed our legal team to proceed to the Court of Appeal to interrogate this judgment. “I urge all men and women of goodwill and lovers of Benue to keep the faith. Our vision for a peaceful and prosperous Benue lives on,” he said. NAN recalls that Jime and the APC had challenged the return of Ortom of the PDP by the National Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) on the grounds of substantial noncompliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended). They also asked the tribunal to either declare him winner of the March 2019 governorship election or nullify Ortom’s election and order the conduct of a fresh election in the state. The governor has, however, extended his hands of fellowship to Jime and others, urging them to join hands with him to develop the state. “Politics is over; it is now time for governance. This administration is willing to collaborate with everybody, irrespective of political, ethnic and religious differences,” he said. (NAN)
