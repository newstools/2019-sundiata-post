LAGOS – A Police Inspector attached to the Highway Patrol on Saturday night shot his wife and himself after a disagreement. It was gathered that the policeman identified as Edward was allegedly drunk at the time he pulled the trigger at close range.

It was gathered that the couple were in the habit of quarrelling and their situation worsened after the woman opted out of the union. Her threat, it was learnt was borne out of the man’s alleged mistrust and possessive nature. In the heat of the disagreement, the policeman cocked his gun and fired at his wife. He was said to have thereafter shot himself in the head. The Nation gathered that their neighbours at Flat One alerted Ikoyi NCoS officials who rushed the duo to the hospital. It was learnt that the woman died on Sunday morning while doctors were battling to save her and the Inspector died afterwards.
