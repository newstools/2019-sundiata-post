FROM MESSY SEAT OF POWER YOU CAN ONLY GET A MESSED-UP NATION! There are so many things I hear about this government everyday which I cannot write about. Not for any security concern but more for professional reasons. But I can say this: since independence, we have never had a DYSFUNCTIONAL FIRST FAMILY like we currently have under General Mohammadu Buhari. From his immediate family to his cousins to his siblings, the tunes are discordant. The exposé by Mamman Daura’s daughter is just a tip of the iceberg. The outburst by Aisha is just a fraction of the pains the woman feels everyday. Whether these pains are justified or not is a different thing entirely. But the woman feels both his husband and his government have been hijacked by those who didn’t even believe in the project before. And this fault is SQUARELY AT BUHARI’S DOORSTEP. When a leader cannot hold his immediate family together, how can he hold a nation of different ethnic and religious stocks together? What is happening in larger Nigeria is a reflection of the dysfunctionality in Aso Rock It is a season film: by the time you get to the middle, you won’t even remember the beginning again.
