…Demands Explanation On Funding of First Lady’s Office By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has challenged President Muhammadu Buhari to lead by example by ending the profligacy that pervades his Presidency in order to give validity to his directives to ministers and other functionaries. In the same vein, the PDP tasked the Buhari Presidency to explain the basis and source of Presidential support for the Office of the First Lady, including the appointment of aides, contrary to his promise not to run that office The in a statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan sent to Sundiata Post held that Mr. President remains responsible and answerable for his presidential assurances and Nigerians expect an explanation on the violation of such sensitive undertaking. “While the PDP is still monitoring the implementation of directive to government functionaries on cost cut, the party tasks President Buhari to take the first step by immediately fulfilling his promise to reduce the Presidential fleet, as well as cut his over bloated entourages and curtail the opulent lifestyle in the Presidency, which is daily flaunted before suffering and impoverished Nigerians. “The PDP invites Nigerians to note that the Buhari Presidency has proven to be extremely expensive and a major draining pipe for valuable resources, while millions of compatriots, who look up to government for solutions, wallow in hunger and acute poverty. “The profligacy that permeates the Buhari Presidency had further manifested in the public fight between the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, and President Buhari’s nephews over issues of opulent accommodation in our presidential villa. The party further urged Nigerians to note that the Buhari Presidency has failed to make the details of its budget public, despite demands by our party and other well-meaning groups in Nigeria. The failure to make the details of the Presidency budget public places a huge burden on the Buhari Presidency, particularly in the face of allegations of budgetary corruption and financial sleazes. Unless the Presidency budget is made public for Nigerians to see, any directive on cost cut remains cosmetic.
