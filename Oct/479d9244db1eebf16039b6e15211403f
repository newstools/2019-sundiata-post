By Uchenna Inya ABAKALIKI – A man, whose name was given as Kelechi Nwigbo from Akahufu Ekpaomaka in Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, was at the weekend was said to have been struck dead by thunder in his hotel room. The incident occurred at Mark Doris Hotel in Eke Market Afikpo, Afipko North Local Government Area of the state. Nwigbo, who based in Germany, had checked into the hotel with instructions that nobody should disturb him, but after four days, the hotel management started perceiving an offensive odour from his room and immediately alerted Police in Afikpo. When Police officers broke into the room, the man was seen carrying a calabash with some money inside and with white cloth material on his head and waist. Workers in the hotel told our correspondent that the hotel management had heard the thunder strike from his window, but because the guest had instructed that nobody should come to his room unless he called the hotel’s attention. They did not bother going to check on him. It was learnt that the last time he returned to Nigeria was in 2017 and that the family was not aware of his presence in the country let alone being in Afikpo after 13 years. (New Telegraph)
