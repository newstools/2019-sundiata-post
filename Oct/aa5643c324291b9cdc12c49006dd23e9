Akosua Adomako Ampofo, a Professor of African and Gender Studies at the Institute of African Studies, University of Ghana, has come against those who absolve lecturers from blame in student-lecturer s*xual misconduct. She said she was bittered and exhausted over the utterances of some Ghanaians after two lecturers were implicated in the ‘Sex-for-Grades’ saga. According to Eyewitness News, Ampofo said the latest development should be dealt with decisively to empower victims to come forward for their problems to be solved. She said, “I get so exhausted when people say the students also harass the lecturer and I ask if they [lecturers] do not have the strength; you that have more power and responsibly more than her? It is a recurring problem as people have said and we are behaving like ostriches. “This is something that is going on in our environment. We are aware of it. It happens to our daughters, sisters and occasionally our brothers and until somebody speaks up, the rest of us continue to go on with our everyday life and that is very disturbing.” Ghanaweb reports that the University of Ghana has interdicted the lecturers captured in the video. The two lecturers, Prof. Ransford Gyampo and Dr. Paul Kwame Butakor are expected to be hauled before the University’s Anti Sexual Harassment Committee to assist with internal investigations in the coming days.
