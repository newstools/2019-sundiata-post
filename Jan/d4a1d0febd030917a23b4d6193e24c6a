Dar Es Salaam – The UN in Tanzania on  Tuesday condemned the recent suspected ritual killing of 10 children in the east African nation’s southern highland region of Njombe. “The UN in Tanzania offers its deepest condolences to the families
and communities of children, who have been brutally murdered in Njombe
over the last few weeks,’’ the UN said in a statement. The UN said the attack and murder of children were unacceptable. “Children have a fundamental right to be safe and be protected from
violence so that they can enjoy their childhood and reach their full
potential,’’ the UN said. “The UN joins the government of the United Republic of Tanzania in condemning these heinous acts. “As the UN, we stand ready to support the government in their efforts
to address the issue,’’ said Alvaro Rodriguez, UN Resident Coordinator
in Tanzania. “Additionally, we call upon all stakeholders to join hands to ensure
that homes, schools and communities are safe spaces for children,’’
added Rodriguez. The statement said children were exposed to extreme forms of violence and exploitation in many parts of the world. “This has to stop,’’ said Maniza Zaman, UNICEF Representative in Tanzania. Zaman added that no form of violence or abuse against a child, is
acceptable or permissible for any reason and such act is an outright
violation of their basic human rights. Ruth Msafiri, Njombe District Commissioner, said on Monday that 10
children’s dead bodies were discovered in different parts of the town,
some being slaughtered and their body parts removed. The Deputy Minister for Home Affairs, Hamad Masauni, swore that the
government would hunt all the killers and bring them to book.
