Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The long awaited Presidential debate
has just started in Abuja with the incumbent president and Presidential candidate
of the All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari and the main
opposition Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar conspicuously
absent. The three presidential candidates in attendance at the commencement of the debate are; Mr Kingsley Moghalu of the Young Progressives Party (YPP); Dr Oby Ezekwesili of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) and Mr Fela Durotonye of the Allied for New Nigeria (ANN). Presidential candidate of the YPP, Mr Kingsley Moghalu said
he is asking Nigerians to vote him because he wants to restructure Nigeria
constitutionally, break the backbone of poverty in Nigeria, restore the battered
economy of Nigeria occasioned by bad leadership. On his party, the presidential candidate of the Allied
Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) Dr Oby Ezekesili said that she is asking
Nigerians to vote her because according to her, as Late Chinua Achebe rightly pointed
out, over the years, Nigerians problem has been that of bad leadership and as
such , as a technocrat who now understands the problems of Nigeria, she is in
the race to make a difference and to give the country a face lift. Sundiata Post recalls that the PDP Presidential candidate
was before the commencement of the debate was around but decided not to appear.
The reason for his decision not to take part in the debate was sketchy at the
time of filing this report. Details Later…
