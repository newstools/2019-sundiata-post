By Okeoghene Akubuike  Abuja   –      Mrs Olushola Bankole, President, National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS), FCT Chapter, has advised parents against rushing their children through school and allow them pass through the required classes. Bankole who is also a Counselor, gave this advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Wednesday. She said children rushed through school missed out on vital things needed for each class they had skipped. “That is the story of many children that were pushed through school. They may do well academically, they can pass exams because they are very smart and intelligent. “ But success in life is according to a research 20 per cent IQ- that is the academics, the cognitive abilities and all that and 80 per cent EQ that is emotional intelligence. “So parents that are pushing their children, they are paying for the doom tomorrow; but allowing this children mature. “ Even in deploying technology, there is need for maturity, if they are not mature they will mishandle it and it will cause a lot of harm. “ Nigeria needs innovators ; what we are seeing with all these children that they are rushing is that if I see the one that I will call a genius , it means that one that can bring to bear innovative ideas. `And you see age and maturity has to do with getting to that point that you can think through this problem and come up with a solution that is useable, that is fitting for others to learn from or to benefit from. “Infact I tag this campaign “No Rush Push’’; don’t rush the children, don’t push the children, allow them go through school.‘’
