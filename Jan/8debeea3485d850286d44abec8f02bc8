By Bushrah Yusuf-Badmus  Ilorin    –    An Ilorin-based legal practitioner, Mr Lanre Bello, on Monday, advised politicians against do or die politics, as the 2019 general election approaches. Bello, while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin, said it was high time politicians eschewed hate speech and hooliganism in order to achieve their aspirations. According to him, the people, who constitute the electorate, are now aware of what they want and they can no longer be manipulated. “Politics is just a game. Our politicians must demonstrate maturity and fair play in the political game. “The people should say no to assassination of political opponents, thuggery and snatching of ballot boxes, rather, they should be decent and law abiding. “The should try to emulate the western world by accepting the outcome of elections and support whoever emerge as winners to move Nigeria forward,” said. The legal practitioner, however, called on politicians to be ambassadors of good democracy by being friendly in the February election.
