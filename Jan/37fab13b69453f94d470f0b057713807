By Olajide Idowu Osogbo â€“ The police command in Osun has arrested six suspected highway robbers all dressed in military camouflage uniforms operating along Ife-Ilesa Expressway in the state. Mr Fimihan Adeoye, the State Commissioner of Police paraded the suspects at the command headquarters in Osogbo on Wednesday. He said the suspects were arrested at the scene of the robbery
operation by his men with the aid of local vigilantes on Monday night. Adeoye said two other suspected highway robbers who planted spikes on
the roads to puncture vehicle tyres in order to rob motorists and
passengers were equally arrested. He said before their arrest, the two-man robbery gang had used carved
wooden guns, covered with black cello tapes to rob their victims. He said police investigations established that the suspects were all
from Lagos, but came to operate in Osun and always returned to base. The police commissioner also announced the arrest of one Yekini
Kareem, 62, who had been on police wanted list in the last two years. He said Kareem, also known as Abija, lured a rice seller from Saki in
Oyo to Osogbo, in May 2017 and engaged some criminals to dispossess him
of his goods and money, before killing him. He also said the command had so far arrested five persons in
connection with the case between the period of the incident and December
2018. He said the prime suspect recently arrested at his hideout in Lagos
on Monday and other arrested criminal suspects would be charged to court
soon. (NAN)
