By Polycarp Auta  Jos   –     Most Rev. Ignatius Kaigama, the Catholic Archbishop of Jos, has decried the increasing rate at which fake news and hate speeches were flying in Nigeria. Kaigama, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Jos, also expressed regrets that Nigerians were engaging more on things that divided, rather than those that built and united them. “It is so sad that Nigerians engage in negative things that easily divide us, instead of promoting issues that will unite and bind us together. “This is why we have fake news and hate speeches being peeled around everyday. People tell stories that have no foundation whatsoever, just to distract others and create confusion. “Instead of focusing on useful thoughts and meditating on spiritual, philosophical and scientific issues, we rather concentrate on spreading news and information that have no basis,” he lamented. The prelate, who described fake news and hate speeches as “menaces” that required urgent attention, called on government at all levels to devise possible means of tackling them. He urged Nigerians to engage in things that would promote the common good of the nation, and not those that could distract and create disharmony.
