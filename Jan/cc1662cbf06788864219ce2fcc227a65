Presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has withdrawn from the race, three weeks to the poll. The 55-year-old announced her withdrawal on Thursday morning. She said her decision comes after extensive consultations with leaders across the country. She said she will now devote her time “to help build a coalition to defeat the All Progressives Congress and the People’s Democratic Party in the February 16, 2019 election.” Meanwhile, Nigerians have taken to social media to share their thoughts on the decision. While it comes as a shock to some, it is a mocking opportunity for others who think she was never a viable candidate. See reactions below:
