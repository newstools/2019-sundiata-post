ABUJA
(Sundiata Post) – Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, constitutional lawyer and
human rights activist, has said that the suspension of the Chief Justice
of the Federation, Justice Walter Onnoghen, amounted to suspension of
the Nigerian Constitution by President Muhammadu Buhari.In a statement he issued on Friday in Abuja, Ozekhome called for mass protest to force the Buhari to reverse the decision.He drew attention to a similar action in Pakistan in 2007 and how it was resolved by mass protest.The full statement reads:The
alleged suspension from office of the CJN is the vilest, thieving, most
despicable, ultravires, undemocratic and brazenly  unconstitutional act
ever carried out by any government in Nigeria, civilian or military,
since 1st January, 1914, when the contraption called Nigeria was
forcibly contrived through the  amalgamation of Northern and Southern
Protectorates. The
desperate act of a sit-tight president constitutes a direct suspension
of the Nigerian  Constitution and the entire  democratic process.It has
finally removed the remaining veneer of pretension to democratic
credentials by Buhari and  his all- conquering cabal.Welcome, Nigerians, to full blown dictatorship, absolutism, authoritarianisn and fascism.Buhari
has behaved worse than what he was as a military tyrant. Military
juntas always only suspended parts of the Constitution they did not
like. But,
by torpedoing the entire judiciary, rule of law and due process,
including four valid High Court/Federal High Court rulings and
yesterday’s ruling by the Court of Appeal, all of them staying
proceedings of the phoney and funny charges levelled against Onnoghen
before the CCT, Nigerians now know that we have now become an endangered
specie.It
means that the next election is nothing more than a ritualistic outing
to illegally confer life presidency (not just 4 years) on Buhari.There
is no known basis, legal, constitutional or moral, to hurriedly bypass
courts of law, the judicial process and court orders, to illegally
remove the CJN and swear in an Acting CJN.The provisions of section 292(2) of the 1999 Constitution are  quite clear on how the CJN can be removed from office.Aside
sections 153, 158 and parts 1 and 2 of the 3rd schedule to the
Constitution which provide that a judicial officer can not be removed
from office until he has first been tried and dealt with by the National
Judicial Council (NJC), section 292(2) makes it clear that the
president can only remove the CJN from office before the age of his
retirement, “acting on an address supported by two-thirds majority of
the Senate”.When did the Senate meet to donate this power to the
president? NEVER. The
president has illegally and unconstituonally stripped both the
judiciary and the Legislature bare of their constitutional  functions,
usurped their  powers and enthroned maximum dictatorship over the
affairs of Nigeria, like Louis X14 once did when he stood in front of
parliament, beat his chest imperiously and declared, “l’est tat c’est
moi” (I am the state).The
ill-advised  action does not only assault our noble sense of humanity
and dignity as decent Nigerians, it also violently desecrates the
principles of rule of law as espoused by Prof A.V.Dicey and the hallowed
doctrine of separation of powers as ably propounded in 1748 by the
great French Philosopher, Baron De Montesque.WHAT TO DO?Nigerians should brace up, come out enmasse, to protest against this illegality.We are back to full  Abacha era, as OBJ rightly noted three days ago in his patriotic letter to Nigerians.Nigerian lawyers and the NBA should shut down all courts in Nigeria until the CJN is returned to his seat.This
was achieved even under military dictatorship in Pakistan, when former
Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf illegally removed from office, the
then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry on
11th March, 2007.All
the lawyers went on strike, from 15th March, 2007, shut down the courts
and protested on the streets for months, until a panel of 7 members of
the Supreme Court sat and held that the removal was illegal and
reinstated the Chief Justice.Nigerian
lawyers should act now.The NASS should also shut down in protest and
allow Buhari and his cabal have their jolly ride over cowed, hapless,
vanquished and conquered Nigerians.There is no more democracy in
Nigeria.It is as dead as dodo.The
coming presidential election is but a mere charade to confer legitimacy
on a pre-rigged, on-the-spot rigged and post-rigged election. The
pretentious chicken has finally come home to roost.This recent act is a big standalous shame on the Buhari government, assuming it still knows anything called shame.It has tainted it with the paint brush of odium, obliquy and international derision.The inteconsnational community should weigh in immediately to prevent Nigeria from burning.
