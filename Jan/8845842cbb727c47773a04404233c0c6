By Rukayat AdeyemiN Lagos – Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun, Vice-Chancellor, Lagos State University (LASU), on Monday hailed the institution’s male soccer team for emerging champions at the inaugural African Students Football Union (ASFU) 2019 tournament. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the LASU’s male soccer
team won the ASFU championship which final held at Adamasingba Stadium,
Ibadan, Oyo State on Jan. 27. The LASU team won after it defeated the University of Development
Services (UDS), Ghana team, a West African University Games (WAUG)
champion. Following the victory, LASU will represent Africa at the World
Universities Football Competition which is to hold in Russia later in
the year. Fagbohun said that the victory by the team proved that the
university’s gradual and steady rise to the summit of league of
universities in Nigeria was not a fluke. He said it was a testament in its ability to compete and win in every sphere. “This shows that what we can do in academics, as clearly expressed in
our status as Africa Centre of Excellence (ACE), we can also do in
sports. “Your victory at the tournament is not for Lagos State only, but for Nigeria as a whole. “I want to assure you that the university management will give you
all necessary support as you will be representing Africa at the world
stage in Russia later this year,’’ Fagbohun said in a statement. NAN also reports that other institutions which participated in the
competition are Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, University of
Kenyatta, Kenya, Edo State University and Tai Solarin University of
Education (TASUED), Ijebu-ode.
