By Afusat Agunbiade-Oladipo  Ilorin    –       An Ilorin Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday remanded two fake Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) staff, Adeleke Benjamin and Adedeji Solomon, over alleged attempt to kill one Comfort Olupinla. The Magistrate, Esther Abu, ordered the remand of the accused at Okekura Prison in Ilorin. She adjourned the case until Jan. 25 for further mention. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Abideen Oderinde, had told the court that the accused persons invaded the complainant’s house at Adewole Housing Estate in Ilorin on the pretence of being IBEDC staff reading electricity meters. He said that the accused persons later deceived the complainant, demanded for drinking water during which they gained entry into her house and attempted to kill and rob her of her valuables. Oderinde said that the complainant raised the alarm which drew attention of a passerby who rescued her and handed over the accused persons to the police. He said that a locally made gun was recovered from one of the accused when they were searched. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. The prosecutor said the accused were being tried on three-count charge of criminal conspiracy, attempted robbery and attempt to commit culpable homicide contrary to Sections 97, 299 and 95 of the Penal Code Law. He urged the court to remand the accused persons pending the outcome of the investigation
