Sydney    –      Venus Williams celebrated her 19th main draw appearance at the Australian Open with a come-from-behind 6-7(3) 7-6(3) 6-2 victory over 25th seed Mihaela Buzarnescu on Tuesday, marking a successful day for some of the sport’s oldest active competitors. The 38-year-old, who is unseeded for the first time since 2014 and is the oldest player in the women’s draw, will meet France’s Alize Cornet in the second round. It was a good day for some of the veterans of the sport after big serving 39-year-old Ivo Karlovic, the oldest male player, served his way into the second round against Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz, a man 18 years his junior. Title contender Roger Federer, aged 37, comfortably won his first round match on Monday.
