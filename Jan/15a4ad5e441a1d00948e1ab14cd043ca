The Presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has said that he once had to lend the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission money totalling N300m from the proceeds of privatisation when the then newly formed agency could not take off because there was no money with which it could do so. Atiku said this on Wednesday evening at The Candidate, a political forum where he and his vice presidential running mate, Peter Obi, were engaged in a question and answer conversation conducted by Khadaria Ahmed.
