London – Unilever reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales on Thursday hurt by inflation in Argentina and flat volume growth in developed markets in its first set of results since new Chief Executive Alan Jope took charge. The maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream said fourth-quarter underlying sales rose 2.9 per cent. Analysts, on average, were expecting 3.5 per cent, a consensus forecast supplied by the company showed. The Anglo-Dutch group, which is working to move on from last year’s
botched plan to shift its main headquarters to the Netherlands, had said
full-year sales growth would be at the bottom end of its three to five
per cent forecast range. Looking ahead, it said it expects 2019 market conditions to remain
challenging and forecast underlying sales growth again in the lower half
of a three to five per cent range with continued improvement in
underlying operating margin and another year of strong free cash flow. It said it remained on track for its 2020 goals. In the fourth quarter, Unilever blamed Argentina, which makes up 2.5
per cent of its overall business for hyperinflation that led prices to
spike more than 50 per cent and therefore volume to fall more than 20
per cent in the quarter. But more broadly, sales volume in the Americas was flat as pricing growth was offset by volume declines. The same happened in Europe, though the company eked out 0.8 per cent
sales growth in the region. Overall, underlying sales in developed
markets grew only 0.4 per cent in the quarter. The company blamed declines in France and competitive pressures in North America, particular in ice cream and mayonnaise. For the full year, Unilever reported turnover of 49.6 billion euros
($57.05 billion), excluding its divested spreads business with
underlying sales up 3.1 per cent in line with expectations. Its full-year earnings were 3.48 euros per share.
