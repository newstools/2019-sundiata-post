Kampala – Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni says telecom firm MTN Uganda needs to sell shares on the local stock exchange to facilitate domestic ownership of the company. Museveni made the comments while meeting MTN Group’s President and
CEO Rob Shuter on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on
Thursday. The Ugandan President said the aim was to ensure more of the money it earned stayed in the country. The company is the East African country’s largest telecommunications
firm, controlling a subscriber base of more than 10 million. However, relations between MTN Uganda and authorities have become
strained after the country this week deported two of its executives
after accusations they were compromising national security. “It is important that you float shares on the local stock exchange to
allow for local ownership,” Museveni was quoted as telling Shuter,
according to a statement from his office. Museveni accused some unnamed telecoms companies of dodging taxes by
under-declaring the volume of calls and that his government had bought
machines that helped detect such activity. Museveni also said telecommunication firms in Africa, which were
often foreign owned, repatriated profits back home to the detriment of
local economies. “You should foresee these trade deficits. More locally owned
companies should be allowed to earn money so that most of it remains
here,” he said. MTN Uganda did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The statement from the president’s office quoted Shuter as saying the
firm was in negotiations with a Ugandan state-controlled National
Social Security Fund (NSSF) for a possible sale of shares to the fund. There was no confirmation from MTN. MTN is in negotiations with Ugandan authorities for a ten-year
extension of its operating licence after it expired in October last year
but there has been disagreements over the amount of licence fees to be
paid.
