By Abiemwense Moru Abuja – The House of Representatives Ad-hoc Committee investigating the Apex pension body, PenCom, has invited top management staff of the commission and 21 Pension Funds Administrators, (PFAs) to appear before it on Thursday. The committee, set up by the House in Dec. 2018, is expected to
investigate the unwholesome practices by pension administrators and
custodians. In a letter obtained by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday,
and dated Jan. 21, the committee invited the acting Director General
Aisha Dahir-Umar, and other top management staff to explain their roles
so far. Also invited were the pension administrators and custodians mandated with the management of pension funds. In the letter signed by the adhoc committee Chairman, Rep. Johnson
Agbonayinma, (APC-Edo), the stakeholders are expected to furnish the
committee with vital information on the allegations leveled against the
fund managers. The committee, among other requests, demanded for the net assets of
the contributory funds, details of supervisors and regulations of
pension funds administrators; as well as their key instructions and
performances. Other requests demanded were compliance and defaults, details of
payment into the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and bank accounts
operated by the commission. When contacted by journalists, Agbonayinma confirmed the invitation of PenCom by the committee. He said: “Yes, we have invited the top management of PenCom and PFAs
to an interactive session before the investigative public hearing. “The 21 recognised pension fund administrators are expected to be part of the session with members of our committee.” (NAN)
