By Aisha Ahmed Kano – The Head of Service in Kano State, Alhaji Auwalu Na’iya, has urged Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in the state to cultivate a sustainable culture of clean environment. Na’iya made the call on Friday while supervising the monthly
environmental sanitation programme for motor parks, markets and work
places. The head of service appealed to all Heads of all the MDAs to ensure
regular cleaning of their work environments in order to create a
conducive atmosphere for workers. “I order all heads of ministries to follow due process in disposal of littres and waste around their workplaces. “It is our collective responsibilities to ensure we keep our working
environment clean not just for the monthly sanitation sake, but for our
health and welfare,” he said. Na’iya explained that the present administration in the state was committed to providing clean and greener environment. “After going round today, we have noticed that the main issue faced
by the ministries is water scarcity and we have decided to address this
by engaging the Ministry of Water Resources,” he explained. NAN reports that the HoS inspected nine ministries in the state secretariat during the monthly environmental sanitation.
