The University of Wollongong in Dubai (UOWD) has participated in a series of academic integrity awareness campaigns including the Global Ethics Day and the Week of Actions Against Academic Misconduct to convey a holistic, consolidated message to the student community on the importance of integrity in education and beyond. This awareness campaign was lead by Dr Zeenath Khan, Assistant Professor and Ethics Lecturer in the University of Wollongong in Dubai (UOWD). Dr Khan said the University’s persistent campaigns on campus have had a positive and significant impact on its students with several of them coming forward to share their stories of how they have been approached by third party companies and how they have rejected their services despite being tempted to use them. Participated in several poster and storytelling competitions were students enrolled in a variety of ethics subjects in the University with three winning teams having the opportunity to participate in the second ethics event – the Responsible Business and IT Use Vlogs program (ReBitVlogs), debating and discussing the role of technology in helping or hindering workplace harassment with industry experts. Joining the winning teams to bring in real-world perspectives during the ReBitVlog debate was the University’s own corporate experts, Ms Hina Sarwat, Director of Human Resources, UOWD and Dr Mai El Barachi, Associate Professor and recent winner of the UOWD Research Excellence Award with Ms Sarwat who brought in the importance of a framework and governance to the table while Dr El Barachi threw the responsibilities back on the users of the devices and digital spaces as the drivers of the role technology plays on workplace harassment, rather than on the actual devices or apps. Concluding this year’s awareness campaigns, UOWD’s Week of Actions against Academic Misconduct highlighted misconducts such as contract cheating as well as poor and unethical research practices and has determined to be strongly committed in upholding it’s high standards of academic integrity on campus by means of various policies to combat academic dishonesty and to also supports and encourages honesty and responsible behaviour.
