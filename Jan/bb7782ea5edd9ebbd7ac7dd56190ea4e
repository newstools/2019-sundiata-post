By Amen Gajira Minna – Ahead of the 2019 general elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has commenced training of 2,666 corps members serving in Niger as electoral officers. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the first phase of the
training which commenced on Tuesday ended on Friday in Chanchanga Local
Government Area of the state. The pilot group of corps members were earlier trained in December 2018 to act as support trainers to other corps members. Mr Frank Ngwu, who led the team of INEC trainers, said that the
exercise was part of the commission’s preparations for the forthcoming
general elections. The corps members were provided with the election manual, which
includes the rules of engagement of the electoral process and
comprehensive lessons on the details of their duties as electoral
officials. (NAN)
