President Muhammadu Buhari extends heartfelt appreciation to the people of Plateau State, who turned out in innumerable numbers to welcome him in Jos, during his presidential campaign visit on Saturday. This was made known by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity) today. The Rwang Pam Township Stadium, venue of the event, was too packed that the President could not eventually address the crowd. After waiting for about an hour, with the melee not receding, President Buhari received illustrious Plateau citizens who were crossing to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from other political parties, waved at the appreciative crowd, and left for Abuja. The President lauds Plateau people for turning out in their thousands to welcome him into Jos, lining the roads right from the airport, defying the boiling sun. He thanks them for their steadfastness over the years, and for continued faith in the administration, which was indicated by the turnout at the stadium. President Buhari sues for greater restraint from teeming supporters and appreciative Nigerians in other campaign stops ahead, pleading that they allow the campaign programme run as planned, since it is also an opportunity for him to give a stewardship report. “We have been serving you for about four years, we want another four years mandate from you, it is needful for you to allow us give you a report. You deserve it,” the President says. Campaign visits resume on Monday, as President Buhari is resolved to get to all parts of the country, before the February 14 deadline. Presidential election holds on February 16, 2019.
