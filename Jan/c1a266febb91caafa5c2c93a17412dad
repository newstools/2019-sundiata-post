Colombo,   –      Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, has appointed a 10-member commission to restructure the National Airline, Sri Lankan Airlines. He carried out the appointment after it recorded a loss of nearly 105 million U.S. dollars for the financial year of 2017 and 2018, local media reported on Tuesday. The committee will be headed by State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne. A statement from the president’s office said that the committee had been instructed to hand over its recommendations to Sirisena in two weeks. Similarly other parties too could submit their suggestions and ideas to develop the national airline. “The president will take the future decisions regarding SriLankan Airlines, taking into consideration of those recommendations,’’ the statement said.  The government in August 2018 said it will renew its search for an investor for SriLankan Airlines. In 2017, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, had said that the government was seeking an international partner who could manage and invest in the flag carrier. The airline had recorded a massive debt of 3.25 billion dollars when the government came into power in 2015. Wickremesinghe said the Sri Lankan Airlines was a “landmine’’ for the country’s economy with its high debts and the government would take over part of its debts to seek for an international partner or investor.
