By Isaac Ukpoju Lafia – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it will engage 30,000 ad hoc staff for the successful conduct of the 2019 general elections in Nasarawa state. Dr. Uthman Ajidagba, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in
charge of the state disclosed this in an interview with newsmen on
Wednesday in Lafia. Ajidagba explained that the number comprised various categories,
including supervisory presiding officers, presiding officers and
assistant presiding officers. He said 8,000 corps members would serve as presiding officers during the elections. “We have commenced the training of our ad hoc staff since last week,
starting with the Supervisory Presiding Officers (SPO), who have been
assigned to their various local government areas. “These supervisors would in turn train other categories of staff for
three days between February 1, and February 3 using the training manual
provided.” He appealed to stakeholders, especially the media, to collaborate
more with INEC in sensitising the electorate in order to ensure
successful polls. “The media should do more of the enlightenment as part of their corporate social responsibility to the nation.” Ajidagba further appealed to the electorate who had yet to collect
their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to pick them from their electoral
wards, adding that voters had up to Feb. 8 to collect their PVCs.
