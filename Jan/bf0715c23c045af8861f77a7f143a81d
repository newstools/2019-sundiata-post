“He is a failure. We know. But let’s support him so that Yoruba will take over from him if he dies or Osibajo will take over for Yoruba in 2023.” I have heard this severally from my Yoruba compatriots off Facebook! Their calculation is nothing but the reenactment of the Yar’Adua Scenario. Buhari’s showings in debates, campaigns and even speeches only reinforce their convictions that the man is on a steady decline mentally. To them, Osibajo will run the government during his second term and would be able to prepare ground for his ‘corronation’ in 2023! And that is why today, 90% of Yorubas rooting for Buhari do so for Osibajo. Their belief? Buhari will not last till 2023 and if he does, he hands over to Osibajo. ON ONE HAND, THEY WANT ODUDUWA REPUBLIC. ON THE OTHER, THEY WANT TO RULE NIGERIA. Obafemi Awolowo. Odeleye Fadahunsi. Bola Ige. Adekunle Ajasin. Abraham Adesanya. Olabisi Onabanjo. These men will be turning in their graves over how a race known for principled politics progressivism has turned out to be a political wheeler-dealer only interested in grabbing power above promoting common good and constitutionalism! It is sickening…
