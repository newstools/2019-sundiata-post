By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu – The anti-robbery operatives of Enugu State Police Command have in an overnight operation dislodged a gang of suspected armed robbers, killing one while others escaped with bullet wounds. The command’s spokesman, SP Ebere Amaraizu, who disclosed on Thursday said the gang were in the habit of blocking  9th Mile-Udi-Oji River-Awka Road with big stones and woods while robbing motorists. According to Amaraizu, the operatives  confronted the armed robbers
on the road at 3 a.m. at Agungwu, Ugwuoba in Oji River axis of the major
road. He said that the feat was achieved by the operatives of the Oji River Division of the command. “It was, however, gathered that the suspected armed robbers had
already formed the said road block when through intelligence
information, the police operatives swooped on them. “In the ensuing gun encounter between the police operatives and the
armed robbers, one of the armed robbery kingpins (names withheld) from
Ebonyi was hit by police bullet which left him fatally injured and was
later confirmed dead on arrival at a nearby hospital by a doctor. “Other members of his gang believed to also have been touched by
police operatives’ bullets escaped into the bush,’’ the spokesman said
in a statement. Amaraizu said that a manhunt on the fleeing members of the gang had
been intensified, while a full scale investigation had commenced into
the incident. “The command advises members of the public, especially hospital
owners and doctors to watch out and report anyone that will approach
their medical facilities with a wound suspected to be that of bullet
wound for necessary action. “Police operatives are now conducting search for the fleeing members
of the gang everywhere within Oji River and its environs,’’ the
spokesman added.
