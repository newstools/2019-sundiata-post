Dennis Aghanya, the author of the petition against Walter Onnoghen, chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), is President Muhammadu Buhari’s former media aide. Aghanya is the executive secretary of the Anti-Corruption and Research Based Data Initiative (ARDI), a civil society group that petitioned the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) over alleged non-declaration of assets by the CJN.

We have many problems at hand. Violation of a constitutional provision is bad but it is worse to act in an immoral manner,” Aghanya had said. In his recent petition, Aghanya accused the CJN of maintaining domiciliary foreign currencies accounts said to be contrary to relevant laws, especially for public office holders. The group said its petition became necessary “bearing in mind the imminence of the 2019 General Elections and the overwhelming roles of the Judicial Arm both before and after”.
