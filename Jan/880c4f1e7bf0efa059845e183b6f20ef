By Felix Ugboja ABUJA (Sundiata Post) Following the current shutdown of MTN in Kogi state by the state government, the Executive Vice-Chairman, EVC Prof. Umar Danbatta of the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has stated that the problem arose because of a breakdown in communication between the state government and the telecom company, MTN. The EVC said that the Commission made deliberate interventions to resolve the matter at the initial time which led MTN promising to pay about N120m of ground fees to the Kogi State Government. ‘’Along the way, I understand MTN paid about N10m as a show of goodwill towards the agreement. But I think something happened along the way and I won’t pre-empt the investigation they are trying to conduct by engaging the Kogi state government.’’ He said. According to EVC Danbatta, the Governor of Kogi state, His Excellency, Yahaya Bello has been very cooperative and everyone is looking forward to resolving the matter amicably and very soon.
