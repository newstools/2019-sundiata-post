It was easy. First the he got off the couch and started working out and lost 80 pounds in 6 months. During this time, I was his mortal enemy. No matter what I did or said, he heard and thought something else as he had to make me guilty for what he was doing and accusing me of those things when I was not. Basic extreme change in behavior and his perceptions of reality was off. Lying will do that. Aside from that, all of a sudden he liked riding horses when he never liked anything which made him sweat and messed up his hair. Then there was all the missing money with no receipts except for the transactions for all the hotels and florists on the charge card statements all of which he said were business expenses. I really didn’t see how he might need so many local hotels when we lived 5 minutes from work. It’s not like he got snowed in. If I asked what happened to the money in the bank account when we started bouncing checks, he got upset. Then there were all the late nights at the office when he wasn’t there. Then all the things which were “none of my business.” I really didn’t mind, just thought he needed to find out what getting phucked over looked like. It wasn’t the first time and it wasn’t the last either. But who am I to say when one learns their lesson or when it ends? As long as I don’t have to be the bad guy, I’m good. But when I am made into the bad guy to excuse someone else’s behavior, I travel and make new friends and do everything else I want to do. No need to argue with someone who is lying as that will not bring out the truth. Better to let them stew in the mess they’re making. My apologies to anyone unintentionally offended. Source: Quora
