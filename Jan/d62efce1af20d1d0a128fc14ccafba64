By Ruth Oketunde  Abuja – Project Pink Blue, an NGO, says it will organise free cervical and prostate cancer screening for Abuja residents. Mr Runcie Chidebe, the Executive Director of the organisation, said this in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Abuja. He said that the screening slated for Feb. 2, was part of activities to mark the 2019 World Cancer Day on Feb. 4. He added that in commemoration of this year’s World Cancer Day theme tagged “I am and I will”, the event would also feature fund raising, awareness walk, marathon, skate and cycle ride. He noted that the activities were aimed at creating awareness on the ailment and to encourage the populace to get screened of different types of cancer as it was silently killing Nigerians. “The rising cost of cancer treatment and poverty has remained major impediments for several cancer patients to afford cancer treatment in Nigeria. “We believe that early detection and treatment can save a lot of lives but lack of funds hampers survival chances of a lot of people. “If you do not check regularly, you will not know that you are at risk. “The funds realised from the event would be used as a trust fund which will be made available to patients at any given time,” he said.
