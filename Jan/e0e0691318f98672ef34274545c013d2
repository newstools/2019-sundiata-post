By Sunday John Lafia – The Nasarawa State Chapter of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Monday denied endorsing a governorship candidate in the state for the March 2 election, describing it as fake news. Its Chairman, Mr Joseph Masin, made the denial in a statement in Lafia. “It has come to our notice that some people claiming to be officials
of CAN in the state go about extorting money from candidates under the
pretence of endorsing and mobilising for them. “We do not know such persons, so, politicians should be wary of such fraudsters. “CAN is not a political party, therefore, we cannot endorse any candidate. “So, I urge the public to disregard any endorsement rumour as it is a
fake news aimed at causing disaffection,” the chairman said. He said that it is only God that gives power to whom he likes at a time he likes and so, the church is for everybody. Masin advised the public to vote according to their conscience.
