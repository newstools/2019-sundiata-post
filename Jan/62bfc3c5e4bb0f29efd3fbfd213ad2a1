By Moses Kolo  Kafanchan (Kaduna State) –   As anxious Nigerians prepare for the forthcoming general elections, residents of the southern part of Kaduna State have organised a prayer summit to seek God’s intervention toward a peaceful exercise. The summit, held on Saturday in Kafanchan, focused on the need for Christians to be more prayerful and shun ungodly acts that could put them in danger. . Bishop Simon Peters, Chairman, Southern Kaduna Christian Elders Forum, in a speech, urged Christians to love one another and unite toward building a strong and cohesive body. He decried the challenges faced by the people over the years, lamenting that the situation had led to mutual distrust, disrespect, betrayal and high handedness from within and outside the communities. “We must pray to God to give us the power and capacity to turn a new leaf,” he said. In a prophetic declaration, Apostle Emmanuel Nuhu Kure of the Throneroom Trust Ministries, Kafanchan said that 2019 was a year of love, and urged the people to demonstrate God’s love even to those that hate them. The Clergy urged the people to vote wisely in the 2019 election so as to produce credible leaders, admonishing them not to sell their votes because of greed and hunger. Guest Speaker at the summit, Bishop Zakka Bonnet of Solid Rock Fellowship, Kubwa, Abuja assured the people that God was always ready and available to protect His people in all situations and circumstances. Taking his message from the book of Ephesians, chapter 6 verse 18, Bonnet told the people to be prepared to face more maltreatment from rulers of darkness, assuring them, however, that victory would always be theirs in the end.
