London – Crystal Palace have signed winger Bakary Sako from West Bromwich Albion until the end of the season, the English Premier League team said on Sunday. The Malian spent three seasons at Crystal Palace before his contract
expired at the end of the last campaign and the 30-year-old joined
Championship side West Brom in October. “I’m delighted that we’ve managed to bring Bakary back to Crystal Palace,” manager Roy Hodgson said in a statement. Sako scored three league goals in 16 appearances for Crystal Palace
in his final season at Selhurst Park before breaking his ankle. “He’s a player with a huge amount of talent and, as he showed when he
was fully fit last year, he is able to provide a boost to our attacking
options,” Hodgson added. “It’s a particularly pleasing signing, because… he knows the club
inside out and was such an immensely popular figure amongst the squad
with his positive and upbeat attitude.” He is the second player to join Crystal Palace in January, following
the arrival of goalkeeper Lucas Perri on loan from Brazilian side Sao
Paulo. Sako will be unavailable for Sunday’s FA Cup game against Tottenham
Hotspur, having played for West Brom earlier in the competition, but
could feature against Southampton on Jan. 30. Crystal Palace are 14th in the league with 22 points from 23 games.
