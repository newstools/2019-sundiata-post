The Buhari Media Centre (BMC) troll and propaganda factory has been running amok with a January 12 Premium Times story that quoted CJN Onnoghen to have purportedly said he “forgot to update his asset declaration, after the expiration of his 2005 declaration.” I have a lot of respect for the independence, thoroughness, and integrity of Premium Times. Nevertheless, that story provokes many questions. First, we learn today that the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) didn’t personally serve the CJN any summons. The CCB’s registrar, however, said he served the summons to the CJN’s personal secretary on Friday, January 11. From what transpired at the CCB today, it’s now clear that the CJN has not yet formally responded to CCB’s charges, so what document did Premium Times quote in its story? What’s more, assuming he did get the summons handed to his personal secretary on the 11 of January, did he respond to the charges the same day for Premium Times to report on it on the 12th? That would be one of the speediest responses I have ever seen. Maybe I’m missing something. Somebody help. Source: Facebook
