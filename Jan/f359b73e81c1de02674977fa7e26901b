By Mustapha Sumaila Abuja, Jan. 28, 2019 (NAN) With barely few weeks before the general
elections, the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) says it will leave no stone
unturned to prevent the proliferation of illegal arms and ammunition
into the country. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the elections are scheduled to hold in February and March. The Comptroller-General of Customs, Col Hameed Ali (Rtd) said this at
a news conference to mark the 2019 International Customs Day (ICD) in
Abuja on Monday. The World Customs Organisation (WCO) set aside January 26 of every
year to celebrate the ICD in order to draw attention of the global
community toward a particular aspect of customs’ functions. The day is set aside also for customs administrations to highlight
its activities, challenges, achievements, and potential for national
consciousness and greater support. Ali explained that the NCS under his leadership would put all
necessary strategy in place to ensure no illegal weapons entered the
country. He said that if such weapons eventually found their way into the country, they would definitely be seized at the point of entry. “We will make sure that weapons or any tools used by hoodlums for their nefarious activities will never find their way in. “We are members of security committee of the forthcoming general
elections and as a member we have a role to play to ensure hitch free
polls. Meanwhile, the customs boss said that the statutory roadblock by customs officers and men on the highways was still in place. He said that there was never a time the service banned such roadblocks but it only stopped illegal roadblocks. According to him, such roadblocks are put in place for officers and men to carry out routine checks during operation. (NAN)
