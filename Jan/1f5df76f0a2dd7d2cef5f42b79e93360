By Mohammed Mamman  Damaturu   –     Alhaji Umar Kukuri, Yobe chairman of Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), says the low political activities being witnessed in the ongoing electioneering campaigns have reduced the expenses associated with Nigerian politics. Kukuri, who made the remark on Wednesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Damaturu, said the trend was a positive development which meant that the nation could do away with money politics. He also said that the new development would enable those who were interested in contesting elective positions to do so without necessarily being rich. “Nigeria’s democracy is gradually moving toward not necessarily having money for campaigns or having god fathers for sponsorship before aspiring for elective positions. “Since 1999, this is the only general election in which we have not seen money flying around. This is a good development for Nigeria’s democracy,” he said. The chairman also noted that Nigerians were increasingly getting more politically conscious as they would collect money from vote buyers and yet vote against them. He said the council would partner with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and all the security agencies to ensure that Yobe emerged the most peaceful state in the country before, during and after the forthcoming general elections.
