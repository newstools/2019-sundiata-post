LAGOS – The Managing Director of Royal Oak Centre, Mrs Augusta
Ikpea-Enaholo has pledged scaled up services in the events venue and
party rental sector of the hospitality industry. Speaking ahead
of the grand opening of Royal Oaks Centre, at the Lekki-Epe Axis of
Lagos, Augusta Enaholo said though the sector was buzzling with
different management companies, management of Royal Oaks Centre was set
to provide memorable  services for its prospective clients. She
said “We are aware that many people have turned into event management
but we are determined to make every experience with us memorable by
exceeding the expectations of our guest.The hallmark of our services is
hinged on quality and excellence,” adding that “we are aware of what
people need: excellence and quality services  and we are made to render
that service to all our clients”. While appealing to the
government to assist entrepreneurs grow their businesses, the Royal Oaks
Centre boss added ” most businesses would  require Principal
Infrastructure, especially power; security and favourable government
policies to help grow any type business in Nigeria. Without functional electricity most businesses cannot function to its optimal expectation. “So
I use this opportunity to appeal to the government of Nigeria to help
stabilise power supply, if this is done it would mean
profit  maximisation because we rely on alternative power  supply via
generator set for most events running  into over 10 hours. “It would be
challenging if we have to spend all our investments in providing power
by ourselves but with constant power supply, the business would have a
chance to grow and expand,” she further stated. “As regards
favourable  government policies on event centre cannot be over
emphasised. I believe the government is our partner so i appeal that
they set up a committee to look into the several bills and charges
placed on event centres”, she said.
