By Doris Esa Abuja – The Nigerian Air Force says its Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE, has destroyed a terrorists’ hideout and neutralised some of them at Kaicungul, a settlement about 100Km North West of Monguno, in Northern Borno. NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore
Ibikunle Daramola, who disclosed this in a statement on Saturday in
Abuja, said the operation was carried out on Friday. “The operation was conducted on Jan. 25, on the heels of credible
intelligence indicating that the village was being used as a staging
area from where the terrorists assembled to launch attacks against our
troops’ locations. “The ATF therefore detailed an Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (ISR) platform for confirmatory surveillance of the
location, which observed significant terrorists’ activities in the
settlement. “Accordingly, two Alpha Jet aircraft were scrambled to attack the hideout. “The two aircraft took turns in attacking the location, recording
successful hits on the target, leading to the destruction of some of the
structures as well as the neutralisation of some terrorists,” Daramola
said. (NAN)
