By Ummul Idris Abuja, – The President of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Dr Francis Faduyile, on Friday in Abuja said Nigerian doctors and nurses have finalised a move to settle their disharmony for improved healthcare delivery in the country. He made this known while receiving the report of a 10-man Inter-professional Relation Committee. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that doctors under the auspices of the NMA and the nurses under the aegis
of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) jointly set up the committee. The committee, after a four-week term, submitted a report to the presidents of both associations at an event. Faduyile said after receiving the committee report that when
implemented, it would bring about improved services in health
facilities. He said “patients should expect better service delivery now that there is a 27-page report and recommendations
that will tackle the issue of disharmony between NMA and NANNM members. He, however, added that the committee report was still an association document, but after rectifying it would
be presented to the health minister. Mr Abdrafiu Adeniji, the President of NANNM, said “this is beginning of new era in the health sector. “How we demonstrate it is what will make the meaning. “We are going to bring in all other parties in the health sector.” Both presidents commended the committee for a job well done, even as the doctors and nurses at
the meeting agreed to be bound by the document.
