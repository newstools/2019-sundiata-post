By Muhyideen Jimoh  Abuja –  The Chief Imam of Al- Habibiyyah Mosque, Abuja, Ustaz Adeyemi Fuad, has cautioned against the proliferation of extreme religious sects, saying measures should be taken to address the trend. The Imam gave the advice on Friday in Abuja at a special Jumat service to mark the 16th Anniversary of Al-Habibiyyah Islamic Society. Fuad, who decried the spate of insecurity in the country, emphasised the need for all hands to be on deck to address the dangerous trend. He said that the proliferation of religious sects, lack of education and poverty, among other things had contributed immensely to the state of insecurity in the country. He stressed that Islam as a religion frowned at sects because of the wrong and extreme doctrines they inculcate in their followers, which is against Islamic norm. He, however, explained that Islamic societies/ Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) were not sects and were encouraged in Islam. “Let me emphasise that an Islamic society is different from a religious sect, most of these sects have extreme views, which is anti-Islam. “That is why Al-Habibiyyah as a religious organisation will continue to preach peace, unity and national development, ” he said. Fuad said that as part of activities to mark the 16th Anniversary of Al-Habibiyyah Islamic Society, a special lecture would hold on Sunday, Jan. 6, at the premises of the Mosque. He said that the lecture with the theme “Evolving Purposeful Leadership through Corruption Free Elections and “Islam and Security” was part of the society’s contribution to national development. (NAN)
