By Abiemwense Moru Abuja – An NGO, Youths for Peace Building & Development in Africa (YOUPEDA), has called on political parties, security agents and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to imbibe the spirit of fairness for credible elections. Mr Peter Onyeigwe Obi, an official of the organisation, told the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday that imbibing the spirit of fairness
was essential to achieving free, fair, credible and violent-free
elections. “I think the election are going to be 60 per cent peaceful and violent-free. “The remaining per cent constitutes threats that patriotic citizens,
security agents will watch out for and take full responsibility to
check. “I hope that INEC, security agents, government and political parties
will adhere to the spirit of free, fair and credible 2019 elections
constitutionally as well as professionally,” he said. Obi advised youths within the legal voting age to ensure that they
had their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) ready to enable them exercise
their rights. “My advice to the youths within the legal voting age is that they make sure they have their PVCs.” He also emphasised the need for youths to shun thuggery, violence and
avoid politicians who would want to use them to foment trouble. “The youths should shun thuggery and violence. Let them be heroes by
ignoring politicians who want them to instigate violence here and there. “Youths must not sell their votes. They must immediately report any
kind of malpractice they see during the elections,” he said.
