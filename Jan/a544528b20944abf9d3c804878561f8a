“We promised you improved electricity and you all witnessed that our electricity has improved significantly , we promised our youths, women and our elders, traders empowerment, we have done just that,’’ he said.
He said since his assumption of office in 2015, he has not disappointed the people saying that that explain why the state is attracting investors and enjoying peace and progress.
“That is the reason we are able to embark on numerous capital projects when others can’t even pay salaries of their workers, the reason why we are expanding and consolidating our infrastructure amenities such as the construction and commissioning or ongoing works of over 1700 kilometres of roads,” Emmanuel said.
