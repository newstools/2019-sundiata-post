Owerri – The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has expressed dismay at the deplorable condition of fire stations in Imo in terms of equipment and personnel. The Head, Imo/Abia Operations Office of NEMA, Mr Evans Ugoh, made the
observation during an official visit to fire service out-stations
across the state on Thursday. Ugoh urged the state government to immediately address the situation to save lives and property in case of any fire outbreak. While addressing some staff members of the fire station in
Aboh/Mbaise in Imo, the NEMA boss described the station as a `toothless
dog’ that could not do anything in time of danger. “This fire station is a toothless bulldog because it lacks the
capacity to fight fire in case of any outbreak, even the building is
collapsing. “The building has decayed, you lack the equipment and manpower
personnel, so I don’t believe you can do anything in case of any fire
outbreak. Ugoh, who also visited Orlu and Okigwe fire stations, said the
essence of the visit was to ascertain level of preparedness in case of
any emergency. He said some of the inadequacies in the fire stations across the
state included insufficient personnel, lack of functional fire trucks
and protective equipments. While commending Imo government for the modern edifice built for the
station at the state headquarters, he advised Gov. Rochas Okorocha to
ensure that both the headquarters and out-stations be properly equipped.
