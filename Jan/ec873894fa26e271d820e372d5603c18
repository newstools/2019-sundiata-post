By Ifeanyi Nwoko Abuja – Sen. Stella Oduah on Sunday said she would build an Information and Communication Technology Mall in Onitsha that would boost the N6.4 billion turnover of the market.  Oduah, who represents Anambra North in the Senate, made the promise
in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. She said that the mall was part of her plans to empower people in her constituency. She explained that the project would help give the market and the
businessmen a more global presence, adding that it would also boost the
economy of the state. According to her, the project will come up after the training of 800
youths from her constituents in ICT, and they will operate the mall. “We are setting up various ICT Centres. Very soon this month, we are
training 800 in ICT. We are going to develop a Sky Mall for the Onitsha
main market. “Onitsha is a commercial town that has a turnover of N6.4 billion every day, but it is very unorganised. “So we want to encourage and grow this commercial trade and do it in a
way that it would be cost effective so that they have their trade in
one shop but with global presence. “In doing that, the value chain will be huge because we would already
have technologists and young ICT agents who will develop their sites
for them, develop contents and advertise for them,” she said. For the women, Oduah added that she was working on attracting industries that would depend on the crops produced by the women. The senator stressed that her major aim in joining politics was to
liberate her people from poverty and set them on the path of consistent
development.
