ABUJA (Sundiata Post) I have been FULLY conscious of political activities since 1979. But I can tell you without equivocation that no political party has ever used THUGS, ROUGHNECKS and MISCREANTS like the Lagos All Progressives Congress, APC, and its ‘mother’, the Action Congress of Nigeria, ACN. Not even the infamous era of Adebayo Success, the chief thuggery officer, CTO, of the National Party of Nigeria, NPN, between 1979 and 1983 could rival the madness of the APC in Nigeria, especially in Lagos in terms of political thuggery. The ruling APC in Lagos props up these miscreants and thugs, especially members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, NURTW. They mete out violence on real and perceived opponents. They are on the pay-roll of top APC politicians in the state, right from the master himself, Tinubu, to even a local government councillor. If police arrest any of these guys, in a jiffy, they are off the hook. No matter the gravity of the offence, just one phone call, they are out. The Treasurer of the Tricycle Riders Association in Lagos, late Hamburger, was killed in early June 2017. Till today, no one was tried for his death. Was anyone even arrested? ONE OF THESE ROUGHNECKS ONCE THREATENED A GUY WITH A GUN IN MY FORMER AREA AND TOLD HIM: “I AM PART OF ‘TEAM LAGOS’. IF I KILL YOU NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.” I was shocked. Not with the threat but the confidence with which he said nothing would happen. Yet, we are dealing with people who mouth rule of law every day. We are talking of politicians who blame the PDP for impunity. They tell you that brigandage and lawlessness ended with 16 years of PDP. And some MORONS, even with their education, will be echoing these LIES. What happened yesterday was no surprise. You won’t see those guys in any other political party’s rally. Why? They don’t have much to do with them. They know their ‘soulmates’. I am in pains to hear that one of the victims of yesterday’s violence is Emmanuel Oladesu, the Group Politics Editor of THE NATION Newspapers, who suffered gunshot wounds according to a report in PUNCH. He is a personal friend that we do so much together. It is unfortunate that in 2019, we still have to deal with these inanities in our body politics. But that is what these POLITICAL HYPOCRITES are feeding us with buoyed by the support of their giddy and seemingly hypnotised followers. Source: Facebook
