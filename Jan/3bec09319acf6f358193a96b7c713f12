The House of Representatives has passed the National Minimum Wage Bill at N30,000 for workers in the country. The lawmakers passed the bill during Tuesdayâ€™s plenary presided over by the Speaker of the House, Yakubu Dogara. They approved the figure after the bill was read and passed for the third time on the floor of the lower chamber of the National Assembly in Abuja. Prior to the passage of the bill, the House adopted the report of the ad-hoc committee set up to look into the bill presented to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari. It said it decided to adopt the report of the tripartite committee because of the obvious difficult living conditions in the country.
