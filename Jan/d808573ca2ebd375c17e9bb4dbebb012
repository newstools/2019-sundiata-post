and New Year vacation. The vacation, which commenced on Monday, Dec.17, 2018 and ended on Friday, Jan. 4, was announced via a circular, dated Dec. 10, 2018,
signed by NICN President, Justice Babatunde Adejumo. Adejumo stated that there would be no court sitting during the period of the vacation. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that however, during the vacation, Justice Sanusi Kado delivered a ruling that was filed via
a motion ex parte due to the urgent nature of the suit. Kado granted an interim injunction restraining the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria ( PASAN) which embarked on protest over
unpaid entitlements from closing down the complex and embarking on strike on Dec.18, 2018. Meanwhile, lawyers and litigants were seen at the premises of the Abuja Division of NICN on Monday either going for sitting or
