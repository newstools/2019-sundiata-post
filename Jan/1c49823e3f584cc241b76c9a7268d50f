Los Angeles – Klay Thompson scored 23 of his 44 points in the third quarter Monday, tying an NBA record by connecting on his first 10 3-point attempts of the game  against the visiting Golden State Warriors. But the visitors extended their winning streak to eight games with a 130-111 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. Thompson went 3-for-3 from 3-point range in the first half before
hitting his first seven attempts from behind the arc in the third
quarter. He matched the game-opening mark set by Ty Lawson of the Denver
Nuggets on April 9, 2011, and Thompson wound up 10 of 11 from long
distance on the night. Los

40 points and made 10 or more 3-pointers for the fifth time in his
career. The Warriors have won seven straight on the road. Ivica Zubac scored 18 points, Brandon Ingram had 17 and Kyle Kuzma
added 16 as the Lakers lost for the fourth time in their past six games. They fell to 5-9 without LeBron James, who has been out since coming
away with a groin injury on Christmas Day against the Warriors in
Oakland, Calif. Joel Embiid scored 32 points and grabbed 14 rebounds to carry host Philadelphia to an easy victory over Houston. It was the 39th double-double this season for Embiid, who had been listed as questionable for the game due to a sore lower back. Embiid and Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert, who also registered a
double-double on Monday night, are tied for the league lead in
double-doubles. James Harden paced the Rockets with 37 points, his 20th consecutive game with at least 30. Final scores 76ers 121, Rockets 93. Kyrie Irving posted his 11th double-double of the season with 26
points and 10 assists — to go with a career-high eight steals — as host
Boston defeated Miami. Irving is averaging 29.6 points in his past five
games. The Celtics improved to 18-5 at home this season, including nine
straight wins. Boston hasn’t lost a home game since Dec. 21 against the
Milwaukee Bucks. Jayson Tatum added 19 points for the Celtics. Heat reserves Derrick Jones Jr. and Dion Waiters each scored 18 points. Final scores Celtics 107, Heat 99. Paul George scored a game-high 31 points in spite of sitting out the
fourth quarter for Oklahoma City, which never trailed in the victory at
New York. The Thunder have won two straight following a stretch where they lost
five of six. The Knicks have lost six straight, 14 of 15, and 19 of 21. Russell Westbrook narrowly missed a triple-double with 17 points, 10

third game in a row. Donovan Mitchell scored 36 points to lead Utah. Jae Crowder added 15
and Rudy Gobert chipped in 10 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks. It
wasn’t enough to extend a six-game winning streak for the Jazz, however. Final scores Trail Blazers 109, Jazz 104. No Anthony Davis, no problem for New Orleans, which routed host
Memphis in the Pelicans’ first game without their injured All-Star. Davis sprained his left index finger in a loss at Portland on Friday night and is expected to miss a week or two. Jahlil Okafor earned the start in place of Davis and made the most of
it, scoring 20 points on 9-of-11 shooting and pulling down 10 rebounds. Jrue Holiday and Nikola Mirotic each scored 21 for New Orleans, and

added eight assists. Bogdan Bogdanovic led the Kings with 22 points and 11 rebounds. Final scores Nets 123, Kings 94. Trevor Ariza finished with 20 points and 12 rebounds, and Otto Porter
Jr. contributed 19 points off the bench as Washington took charge early
and defeated visiting Detroit. Ariza has given Washington help in different ways since the team
acquired him in a trade on Dec. 15. This time, he went 7-for-13 from the
field and was a force on the boards. He also handed out four assists. Thomas Bryant added 11 points and 12 rebounds as Washington finished
with seven players scoring in double figures. Blake Griffin topped the
Pistons with 29 points and nine rebounds. Final scores Wizards 101, Pistons 87. Zach LaVine led five Chicago players in double figures with 25

for 20 in the decisive third quarter as Orlando pulled away for a win
at Atlanta. Playing for a second consecutive game without Aaron Gordon, out with a
sore back, the Magic fell behind by as many as nine points in the first
quarter before dominating the final three periods en route to snapping a
three-game losing streak. Dewayne Dedmon matched his career highs of 24 points and five
3-pointers for Atlanta. Trae Young added 21 for the Hawks, who were
playing without Kevin Huerter, a late scratch due to a sore neck. Final scores Magic 122, Hawks 103.
