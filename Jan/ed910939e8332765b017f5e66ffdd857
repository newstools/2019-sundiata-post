By Johnson Eyiangho Abuja – The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has donated academic books to the Nigerian Army for distribution to its institutions across the country. Army spokesman, Brig.-Gen. Sani
Usman, said in a statement on Friday that CBN’s Director of Monetary
Management, Mr Moses Tule, presented the books on behalf of the bank’s
Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, in Abuja. Presenting the books, Emefiele said
that the gesture was in line with the bank’s mandate of supporting
academic institutions in the country with necessary materials to improve
learning. He lauded the army for degrading and
decimating Boko Haram terrorists and promised to always support the
initiatives of the army in providing security for the nation. Receiving the books, Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, expressed the Army’s appreciation for the gesture. Buratai noted that the bank had been
playing significant role in counter-insurgency operations through
timely release of funds for the prosecution of war. He, however, requested the bank’s assistance for the renovation of barracks in the North-East. (NAN)
