By Moses Kolo  Kafanchan    –       Mrs Zippora Santa, National Orientation Agency (NOA) coordinator in Kaura Local Government office, Kaduna State, has urged voters to conduct themselves with decorum to guarantee the success of the forthcoming general election. Santa made the appeal on Thursday during a voter education campaign held at Fadan Attakar. She also urged all eligible voters to collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) which would enable them vote during the election. Santa advised them against selling their votes, saying doing so was inimical to the entire democratic process. The NOA official the electorates must to vote wisely and shun all tendencies that would lead to breakdown of law and order before, during and after the election. “I encourage women to come out en mass and fully participate in the election, as it is a way of participating in deciding the fate of the state in particular, and country in general,” she added. Mrs Rhoda Musa, a participant at the event, applauded NOA for the enlightenment initiative, adding that it would go a long way at ensuring the success of the elections. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the enlightenment programme had participants from all walks of life in attendance.
