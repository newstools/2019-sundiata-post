By Uchenna Eletuo  Lagos –  Some holidaymakers, mostly traders from neighbouring Trade Fair Complex Market, have continued to besiege Ijegun Waterfront Resort in Amuwo-Odofin Local Government Area of Lagos. The holidaymakers, most of whom came with family members, expressed delight at the serenity and natural environment of the seaside. They told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the resort, located on the fringes of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent to the Lagos Lagoon at Satellite Town, was a nature lovers’ delight. The resort, made popular by few private investors who built floor bars and guest houses, has the potential for sea cruise to other parts of the Lagos State. Mr Augustin Ebere, a trader, who also visited the resort with members of his family on Wednesday, told NAN that Ijegun Waterfront could compete with any other resort in the world if given the necessary attention. “I came here with my whole family to have fun and appreciate true nature. “The place would have been more alluring if it had boat ride facilities. “It is not enough to stay by the waterside and appreciate it, but one would have loved to have a ride on it,” he said. Mrs Angela Mensa, a Ghanaian, said she had been coming to the resort for three years, especially during festive periods. She also decried the lack of improvement in the resort. “Although, my desire for coming here is to see nature, which I relished much, the newly constructed fish pond is appealing and fascinates people who like to see fish in its natural state. “The place can be improved upon and, through it, raise tourism revenue for the government,” she said. While Mrs Bisi Lawal, a guest house owner in the resort, said that patronage was high during the festive periods, but would drop thereafter. She, however, appealed to government to rehabilitate the roads leading to the resort to enhance easier access for visitors. (NAN)
