By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Vice presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Peter Obi, has charged women in Lagos state to vote massively for PDP, to enable them attain freedom from slavery. This was, even as Mr. Obi also slammed the All Progressives Congress (APC) led government for subjecting the populace to suffering, hunger and poverty.  Obi was speaking on Tuesday, at the rally organised by member representing Ajeromi/Ifelodun federal constituency, Hon. Rita Orji, to sensistise the South-East, South-South and Arewa women groups in Lagos. According to him, “the government of APC has killed the country”, adding that, “Lagos is under slavery and it takes Jimi Agbaje (the PDP governorship candidate) to deliver the state”.  Obi urged the women to mobilise for the PDP presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in the forthcoming election, assuring them of favourable engagements in the Atiku/Obi presidency.  “It is only Atiku that can deliver us from poverty, he is a business man and he has many companies. This one, when he came, he had 160 cows and up till now, the cows have not increased”, Obi told the women.  On her part, wife of the PDP presidential candidate, Mrs. Jennifer Douglas Abubakar, posited that the key to unlocking the breakthrough of the nation lies with the women, saying only women can redeem the nation through massive mobilisations for the 2019 elections.  She said, “It is true there is hunger, it is true that our children are dying, but it takes the women to redeem the county. “The women have said it enough, about the hunger and about the children dropping out of school, but we cannot say it more than the people who are ATIKULATING”, stressing that a vote for PDP and all its candidates across the nation would bring about redemption and breakthrough.
