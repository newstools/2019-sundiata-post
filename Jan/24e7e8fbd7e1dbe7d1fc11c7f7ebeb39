By Oboh Linus  Lafia –   The wife of Nasarawa State governor, Mrs. Salamatu Al-Makura, says that President Muhammadu Buhari’s fight against corruption is aimed at encouraging Nigerians to work hard and be honest in all endeavors. Al-Makura spoke at an APC campaign rally organised by women and youth groups in the North-Central Zone, held on Tuesday in Lafia. “Buhari wants Nigerians, especially the youths, to work very hard; he believes that success is possible with honesty and resilience, instead of corrupt short-cuts,” she said. She said that Buhari deserved a second tenure because he had invested in youth development, and urged Nigerians to vote for him in the Feb. 16 presidential polls. Mrs. Al-Makura advised youths to key into Buhari’s anti-corruption war so as to position Nigeria to take its place among the comity of progressive nations. “We have seen the efforts of Mr president; we want him to continue with his good work so that he will restore Nigeria’s lost glory,” she said.
