By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – People’s Democratic Party
Presidential Campaign Organization (PPCO) has taken Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu down
memory lane on the democratic credentials of its presidential candidate and
former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, challenging him to mention a single
attribute of President Buhari that qualifies him as a democrat. The party which informed that by supporting President
Buhari, Asiwaju has exposed his support for nepotism, hunger, insecurity,
violation of human rights, constitutional breaches, attacks on democratic
institutions, disobedience of court orders and others disclosed this in a statement
signed by the National Publicity Secretary And Director, Media & Publicity PDP
Presidential Campaign Organization, the Kola Ologbondiyan made available to
newsmen. The statement reads in full: The Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign
Organization (PPCO) says its Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, is an
established democrat and that the resort to flippancy by Buhari campaigner,
Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, cannot detract from that fact. The PPCO says Tinubu, in attacking Atiku Abubakar’s state of
the nation address, which embodied the concerns, fears and apprehensions of
Nigerians over President Muhammadu Buhari’s despotic tendencies, has shown that
he has finally turned his back against Nigerians because of pecuniary
interests. We invite Nigerians to note that all the accusations of
undemocratic actions alluded to by Asiwaju Tinubu against Atiku Abubakar did
not come under Atiku Abubakar’s purview of decision or his sphere of control
while in office as the Vice President of Nigeria. If anything, Atiku Abubakar was in charge of the economy
during the period and every Nigerian can testify that, within that time, our
economy thrived to be one of the fastest growing in the world and the
purchasing power of citizens was much higher than what obtains today. It is therefore very pitiable that Asiwaju has become
flippant in his desperation to please the cabal and market a bad product that
President Buhari has become before Nigerians. It is rather unfortunate that while other respected leaders
in our country are rallying with the PDP’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar, to rescue
our nation from the stranglehold of undemocratic forces, Asiwaju is busy dining
with such oppressive forces and casting aspersion on respected leaders, to the
chagrin of Nigerians across the board. From the foregoing, the PPCO challenges Asiwaju to list a
single attribute of President Buhari that qualifies him as a democrat. By supporting President Buhari, Asiwaju has exposed his
support for nepotism, hunger, insecurity, violation of human rights,
constitutional breaches, attacks on democratic institutions, disobedience of
court orders, arbitrary arrests, illegal detention, low purchasing power of
citizens as well as other vices by which the Buhari administration is known. Signed: Kola Ologbondiyan National Publicity Secretary And Director, Media &
