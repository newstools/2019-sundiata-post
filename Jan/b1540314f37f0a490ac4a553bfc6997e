By Polycarp Auta Jos – Dr Hosea Finangwai, the Plateau Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, says the agricultural policies of Gov. Simon Lalong’s administration have boosted farming activities in Plateau. Finangwai said this on Tuesday in Jos at the inauguration of the
newly elected executive members of the state chapter of All Farmers
Association of Nigeria (AFAN). He said that the governor, in the last three years of his
administration, had initiated and executed policies which had promoted
farming activities, thereby making agriculture more lucrative and
attractive in the state. “Gov. Lalong means well for the agricultural sector in this state; he is a farmer-friendly governor. “He has initiated and implemented good policies which have significantly improved farming activities on the Plateau. “Most of our farmers are direct beneficiaries of the Anchor Borrowers Programme and the tractorisation scheme in the state. “Besides, the timely distribution of fertilisers to farmers at
subsidised rates has gone a long way in improving agricultural
activities in the state,’’ he said. Finangwai assured the farmers of the government’s continuous support
in order to make the state the hub of food production in the country. In his acceptance speech, Mr. John Wuyep, the new state AFAN
Chairman, promised to mobilise members of the association to achieve
corporate goals. He pledged to collaborate with government and other groups in efforts
to promote farming in the state, adding that he would explore every
opportunity in the agriculture sector to the benefit of farmers in the
state. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the election of the
executives of the Plateau chapter of AFAN was held on Dec. 13, 2018. NAN also reports that the National Vice-Chairman of AFAN, Hajiya Nana
Bashir, and other dignitaries in the agriculture sector attended the
inauguration.
