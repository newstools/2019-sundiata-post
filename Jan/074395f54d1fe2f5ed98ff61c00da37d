Really, who needs medical attention between Buhari and Obasanjo? The synopsis of President Buhari’s response to Olusegun Obasanjo’s letter likening his administration to the brutal Abacha regime is that the former president is “sick or psychologically challenged”. But I think the riposte is like that of a blind man mocking another man who uses recommended glasses. Who really needs medical attention between Buhari and Obasanjo? Over the years, Obasanjo has shown keenness of mind and body. For a man of his age, that is rare. He has been consistent in his delivery of cutting missives since President Jonathan’s administration. His “letter-bombs” to Jonathan were much celebrated by those who now insult him for his accustomed choice of weapon, and the target of this hit. Obasanjo has not given anyone a reason to question his state of mind. In fact, on Sunday, he held a press conference where he spoke clearly, intelligently and coherently. Could the same be said of President Buhari? Watching Buhari disoriented and lost at the APC presidential rally in Delta state, where he “surrendered” his candidature to Great Ogboru, flagellates speculations about his state of mind. His bizarre display, chronic incoherence and befuddlement at the town-hall meeting with Kadaria Ahmed accentuate the same concerns. And not to forget his “sit-slump” at the rally in Kaduna; it appears the president is in a rapture of oblivion. A vote against Buhari could be a way of setting him free without paying a heavy ransom to his “keepers”.
