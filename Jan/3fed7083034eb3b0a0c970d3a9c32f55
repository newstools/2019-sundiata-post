By Adekunle Williams  Lagos –  The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (NAN) has warned the general public to shun any person(s) parading themselves as recruitment agents of the authority. The General Manager, Corporate Affairs (FAAN), Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, gave the warning in a statement issued on Saturday in Lagos. Yakubu noted that the perpetrators had been extorting money from innocent citizens under the guise of  recruitment. “For the purpose of clarity and emphasis, the FAAN is not embarking on any recruitment exercise at the moment. “The authority wishes to inform the public that recruitment into any government agency has a stipulated procedure. “This include advertisements in national dailies and our official website and social media platforms, in line with the provisions of the Federal Government’s conditions of service,” she said. Yakubu said consequently, any person claiming to be an agent of FAAN in this respect was a fraudster and should be reported to the authority or the nearest police station.” (NAN)
