By Hussaina Yakubu Kaduna – The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Kaduna State Council has cautioned its members against unprofessional conduct during the general elections. “Journalists should take adequate care and abide by the ethics of the
profession in their reportage before, during and after the forthcoming
elections,” it said in a communiqué issued on Wednesday after its
congress meeting. The state NUJ also said  journalists must exercise caution while reporting political issues, in order not to overheat the polity or instigate violence. It stressed the need for a parley between members of the NUJ,
Security agencies operating in Kaduna state and the Independent National
Electoral Commission (INEC) on preparations for the polls. The union appealed to Northern States Governors Forum, owners of the
New Nigerian Newspapers, to resuscitate the company so as to preserve
the legacy of the late premier of Northern Nigeria, Sir Ahmadu Bello,
the Sardauna of Sokoto. (NAN)
