“I choose my service chiefs based on merit,” says Buhari to Southeastern leaders while defending the fact that the security architecture (not just service chiefs) is led by northerners. I guess the only competent people in the army, airfare, navy, and police are northerners. Of course, as he never fails to do, Buhari went on to repeat the nonsense that five of his ministers are from the Southeast without saying that he is constitutionally required to appoint at least one minister from every state, ergo five ministers representing five Southeastern states. It’s no big deal, Baba Nepotism. Baba Nepo for short. Source: Facebook
