By Olubukola Aiyedogbon Ilorin – An NGO, Home and Street Kids Welfare Initiative (HSKi), has called on the three tiers of government to look into the plights of blind people and ameliorate their sufferings. The NGO’s Executive Director, Miss Funmi Omisope, told the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin on Monday that most blind people were
not born blind. Omisope said that many of them ended up being blind due to health
challenges which affects their eyes and lack of prompt and adequate
healthcare. “There are communities in Nigeria where blindness has been taken and
accepted as a normal way of life and it is becoming embedded as part of
their culture. “Women in the blind community believe that the more kids they have, the better their chances of survival. “They have low maternal survival rate, they lack access to primary
healthcare system, thus most of them engage in self-help delivery. “The life of the younger ones can only be described as suffering in silence. “There is no portable water, they are impoverished and their houses
dilapidated, diseases is very high and blindness is on the rise in their
midst. “They have no healthcare facilities, and when they have sicknesses
such as malaria and eye defects, they resolve to self-traditional
medication, which results in eventual blindness,” the executive director
said. She urged government and the society not to give-up on them, saying
that they were part of our communities and should be advocated for. “We, therefore, call on public spirited individuals or group to
proffer solutions to this menace that is about overtaking our society. “Let us join hands to make the world a better place; let us make Nigeria worth living for her citizens,’’ she said.
