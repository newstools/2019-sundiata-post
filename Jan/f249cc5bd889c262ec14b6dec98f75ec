By Femi Ogunshola Abuja – A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Fruitful Vision Youths Empowerment Initiative has lauded the Federal Government’s massive investment in agriculture, saying it would secure a better future for the country. Igwe Dennis Ezebuilo, an Anambra monarch and the founder of the NGO
said this while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday
in Abuja. He said the initiative was committed to providing lasting solutions
to youth’s unemployment and restiveness in the country through
agriculture. He said his team had engaged in utilising potential in the sector for youth empowerment and economic development. “Our members cut across the six geo-political zones and quite a few
youth have benefitted from our initiative by investing in agriculture,’’
he said. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari administration for taking
steps to improve Nigeria’s agricultural exports in line with global
standards. He praised the administration for initiating the Home-Grown School
Feeding Programme (HGSFP) designed to put an end to importation and
market monopoly of farm produce. He added the programme was capable of sustaining economic,
agricultural and job creation across the length and breadth of the
country. He also commended the administration for revitalising universities of agriculture as coordinating partners. Ezebuilo said the agency had been working with the Nigerian
University Commission (NUC) and other development partners to refocus
the universities. According to him, the anchor borrower’s programme has also gone a long way in fast tracking farmers’ access to finance.
