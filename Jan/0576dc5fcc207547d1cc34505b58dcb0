By Blessing Odega Jos, – Mr Vitalis Lanshima, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), candidate for the Jos North/Bassa Federal constituency seat, has promised to publish allocations to his constituency, if elected into office. Lanshima, who addressed a press conference on Wednesday in Jos, said
that the gesture would allow his constituents to asses how their monies
were being spent. According to him, publishing the allocations would boost mutual trust
and enhance mutual confidence between him and those he was
representing. He also promised to run a “community governance system” where the
people in the constituency would participate in decision making
processes over matters that concern them. Lanshima also promised to discourage the act of giving contracts to
politicians, saying that such persons were always responsible for
substandard jobs and uncompleted projects. “As a law maker, I will insist that contracts are issued after an
open bidding system with the bids opened at a public venue and in the
presence of everyone. If that is done, winners of such bids will be more
responsible,” he said.
