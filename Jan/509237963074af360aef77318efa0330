Why is Suya sold at night in Nigeria?
Originally Answered: In Nigeria, why do people buy and sell suya only at night?
Suya isn’t a breakfast food, true, but I’ve never had trouble getting some after work, or for an afternoon snack. It’s usually available by the time folks are getting off work in the early evenings. Now in my old Abuja neighborhood of Jabi, the street stalls didn’t get fired up until dusk, that is true. This was because the sidewalks are unshaded and hot until the sun starts to go down. Also bush bars typically rely on guys grabbing a beer or two after work, before heading home and Jabi food stalls were for neighborhood folks who’d already gotten home, which meant a slightly later crowd. I’m guessing this may be a Lagos question, given how common I’ve seen suya served in the afternoon in both small towns and all around Abuja, along with times I was visiting friends in Jos and Lokoja. If so, I’d guess the notorious Lagos traffic means people get home later and hence the suya sellers plan for night time crowds. Plus Lagos is known for nightlife. There is the magical hour of dusk and early nightfall, when the heat of the day is gone and it’s not so late one worries about theft and other crimes occurring. It’s always the most pleasant time of day for a stroll and many people are out and about then, which is perfect for selling spicy grilled meat. Source: Quora
