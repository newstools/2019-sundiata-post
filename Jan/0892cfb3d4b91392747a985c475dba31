President Muhammadu Buhari has sworn in Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Mohammed in State House today, following the suspension of Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen who is currently standing trial at the CCT for allegations bordering on non-disclosure of assets. This has left a huge debate on social media about the position of the law and if the President had such powers or not. CJN Onnoghen was already set to inaugurate an electoral tribunal committee on 26th January before his suspension today. Many Nigerians are casting doubt on the Presidentâ€™s motives, especially because his decision is coming weeks before the presidential election. See reactions below:
