By Oluwatope Lawanson Ikeja – A 30-year-old Sales Representative, Charles Udeagbala, was on Wednesday brought before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for alleged theft of N3.3 million. Udeagbala, whose address was not given in court, is facing a two-count charge of attempt to commit felony and stealing. The Prosecutor, Insp. Peter Nwangwu, told the court that the accused
committed the offences between February 2015 and January 2019 at Micro
Nova Pharmaceutical Company, No. 3, Billings Way, Oregun, Ikeja. Nwangwu said that the accused sold some drugs belonging to the company, but failed to remit the N3.3 million being the proceeds. “The accused sold the drugs and converted the money to his personal use. “All efforts made by the complainant to get the accused to refund the money proved abortive,” he said. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 21 and 287 (7) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 prescribes a seven-year jail term for offenders. Udeagbala, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Chief Magistrate, Yewande Aje-Afunwa, granted the accused a bail of N650, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Aje-Afunwa said the sureties must be blood relations of the accused. The chief magistrate said that the sureties should show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She adjourned the case until March 28 for mention.
