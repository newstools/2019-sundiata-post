By Ismaila Chafe Abuja, – President Muhammadu Buhari and members of the Presidential Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday departed Abuja for Anambra and Enugu states in continuation of the nationwide re-election campaign. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the president would pay
a courtesy visit to the Obi of Onitsha, in Anambra, inaugurate the Zik
Mausoleum at the commercial city and later address APC rally in the
state. The Buhari administration completed the Zik Mausoleum in October 2018
after successive governments abandoned the project for over 20 years. NAN reports that the president and members of the campaign team would
later move to Enugu to launch the re-election bid and also deliver the
`Next Level’ messages to the people of Enugu state. While in Enugu, Buhari is expected to inaugurate the Post-Graduate
Centre of Excellence built by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and
donated to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. The APC campaign train had on Wednesday visited Sokoto and Kebbi
states where Buhari pledged to consolidate on the achievements of his
administration in the areas of security, economy and fighting
corruption.
