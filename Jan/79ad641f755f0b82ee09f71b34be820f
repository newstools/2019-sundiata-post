By Aderonke Ojediran-Lawal Lagos – Isaac Ikhouria, a veteran of the light-heavyweight boxing category has appealed to corporate organisations to partner with the Nigeria Boxing Federation (NBF) for the development of the game. The septuagenarian made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Tuesday. Ikhouria, who lauded GOtv continuous sponsorship of the game over the
years, said boxing would thrive more if more sponsors joined in it
promotion. “I believe so much in partnership between the federations and corporate sponsors in terms of sports development. “Boxing has promoted the image of the country internationally. “We shouldn’t neglect the sport at all categories; no sport has given
us more medals at international competitions more than boxing. “If we have three or more consistent sponsors like GOtv, we will see how much this great sport can develop,’’ he said. The bronze medalist at the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics told NAN that
the problem with boxing development had nothing to do with lack of
talents. He said “I have said it times without number, we can never exhaust
the talents we have in this country; the talents are enormous. “But with the right structure and programme, I strongly believe that we will achieve so much. “There is need for exposure and we need to instil discipline in them
because the only thing that can limit a boxer is when a boxer is
indiscipline’’. NAN reports that Ikhouria also won a gold medal at the 1973 All African Games.
