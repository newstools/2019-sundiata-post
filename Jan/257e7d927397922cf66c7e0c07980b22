By Mujidat Oyewole Ilorin – The new deployed Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Kwara, Mr Bello Ale,  has promised to ensure peace and stability in the state. Ale made the pledge on Saturday in Ilorin while addressing newsmen
after the handing over  by the out-going commandant,  Adeyinka Fasiu. He canvassed  that maintenance of peace should begin from the
grassroots, starting from the traditional rulers and community leaders. “In order to maintain peace and stability in the society, we must go
back to the grassroots,  that is the traditional rulers,  through whom 
we can easily access the community,’’ he said. The commandant pledged that the NSCDC would continue to cooperate
with the Nigeria Police to ensure peace in the state before, during and
after the general elections. “The police force is an institution of power, and as one of the major
security agencies during the elections, we will cooperate with them in
order to ensure peace and hitch-free elections,” he said. Ale commended Fasiu for his achievements in  ensuring peace in the state and  promised to sustain his legacies. Earlier, Fasiu had charged all officers and men of the command to cooperate with the new commandant. “All my achievements had  been as a result of the cooperation of all my staff, most especially my second in command. “It is said that just one person cannot do it all, so please
cooperate with the new commandant and I assure you that you will
progress well in your duties,” he said. Fasiu also pleaded with the youths to be of good conduct before,
during and after the elections  in order to maintain the good image that
the state had been known for. (NAN)
