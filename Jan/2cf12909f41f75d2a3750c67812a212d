By Shuaib Sadiq Kaduna – The Kaduna State Government has inaugurated a 500-litre Milk and Yogurt processing plant in Ladugga Grazing Reserve, Kachia Local Government area. Malam Dahiru Abdullahi, the Information Officer of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry, disclosed this in an interview with the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Kaduna. He said the plant was inaugurated by Dr Hadiza Balarabe, the running
mate to Gov. Nasiru el-Rufai, on behalf of the Government of Kaduna
State on Tuesday. Abdullahi said the plant was established to boost growth in the
Livestock Sector of the economy and create employment opportunities for
youth and pastoralists. He said the project was implemented by the State government with partnership with the UK-DFID’s Business Innovation Facility. Ladugga is among the largest grazing reserves in the state,
established more that 50 years ago to provide pasture to livestock in
Kachia Local government area. The official said the pastoralists in the reserve were supplied with
Napier grass in 2015, which increased milk yield by more than 100 per
cent. “This led to the creation of milk collection centers and the 500-litre daily processing plant. “This project which was commissioned by the running mate of the
Governor has helped increased the income of pastoralists substantially
and created jobs for women and youths,“ Abdullahi said. According to him, the benefit of the project is making herders
embrace homestead cattle rearing, thereby eliminating the clashes
between farmers and herders in the state. “The initiative has helped the pastoralists shift from the old
practice of moving around which had often resulted into clashes with
farmers. “It would also serve as a model for local and foreign investments
into the livestock sector, thereby boosting the pastoralist economy, and
benefit the government through tax and levies,“ Abdullahi said.
