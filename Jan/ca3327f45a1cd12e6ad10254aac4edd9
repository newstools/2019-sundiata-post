(Sundiata Post) – High Court sitting in Abuja pon Friday granted bail to
lawmaker representing Kogi West at the National Assembly, Senator Dino Melaye. Recall that Senator Dino Melaye has been in the custody of the police since his was arrested on January 4, 2019 and held in a police health facility in Abuja. The counsel representing Senator Dino Melaye, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), informed the court that his client had been in police custody beyond the number of days stipulated by the law. He was therefore granted a bail application by Justice Yusuf Halilu on health grounds. Justice Halilu was of the view the Senator must be healthy to stand trial. He also insisted that the police was put on notice to come and show cause why the detained Senator should not be released on bail. He said
since the Senator cannot be arraigned on the stretcher or ‎on his hospital bed, he
should be allowed on bail to attend to his health. The judge asked him to produce
three sureties, one of whom must be the Clerk of the National Assembly, who
must undertake to produce him when he is to be arraigned in respect of a charge
already filed against him. The
judge said the other two sureties must be owners of properties within the Abuja
metropolis.
