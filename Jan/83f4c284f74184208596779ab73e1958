By Joshua Oladipo  Osogbo   –     A 28-year-old Gabriel Wuraola, was on Friday docked before an Osogbo Magistrates’ Court over alleged assault and breach of public peace. Wuraola, who is facing a four-count charge bordering on assault, breach of public peace and threat to life, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Prosecutor, Insp. Rasak Olaiwola, told the court that the accused broke into the apartment of Abdulrafihi Afeez, and inflicted injuries on him and forcefully demanded money for unknown reasons. Olaiwola said that the accused threatened to injure the complainant before using firewood to cause severe injuries on him, leading to a breach of public peace. The prosecutor said that the incident alerted people in the neighbourhood before the intervention of the police. He said the offences contravened Sections 509, 86(1), 355 and 249(d) of the Criminal Code Cap 34 Vol. 11, Laws of Osun, 2003. The Magistrate, Mr Ola Oladoke, granted the accused bail of N50, 000 and one surety in like sum. Oladoke said the surety must reside within the court jurisdiction with evidence of tax payment and two passport-sized photographs, attached with an affidavit of means. The case was adjourned until Feb. 8 for hearing.
