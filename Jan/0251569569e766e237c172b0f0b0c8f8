By Wandoo Sombo  Abuja   –      The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has condemned the laying of siege on Abuja residence of Sen. Dino Melaye’s by the police, saying it violates his right and that of his family members.
The Executive Secretary of the commission, Mr Tony Ojukwu, in a statement circulated to newsmen in Abuja on Friday, faulted the method adopted by the police in effecting arrest of Melaye.
According to the commission, “by this act, the right to freedom of movement of the occupants of the house has been violated consequentially.
“Is Melaye the only occupant of the house? How about the rest of the family and other people in that house and the neighborhood?
“It is not a matter of whether the doors are locked from inside or outside but that the rest of the people are now terrified and unsure of their security due to the siege.”
According to the commission, under normal circumstances, the police ought to invite anybody for questioning and not to lay siege to the person’s house thereby infringing on the right of others.
The commission said it would not tolerate any form of impunity particularly from security agencies as the February general elections approached.
The NHRC called on the Inspector General of Police, Mr Ibrahim Idris, to order the immediate withdrawal of his men from Melaye’s house.
