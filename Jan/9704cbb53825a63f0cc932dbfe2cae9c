Before Buhari came, Nigerians used to COLLECTIVELY criticise and fight their governments. It was always government versus the people. Ibrahim Babangida
Sani Abacha
Abdusalami Abubakar
Olusegun Obasanjo
Umaru Yarâ€™Adua
Goodluck Jonathan All their regimes had their own negatives and bad policies. And citizens fought them to a standstill! But today, things have changed. It is GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS versus their FELLOW CITIZENS. They fight those who they are suffering government policies together with on behalf of SAME government. Ironically, government has become a spectator as its supporters fight their fellow citizens. And surprisingly, over what ALL citizens are suffering for! I swear: no be ordinary eye!
