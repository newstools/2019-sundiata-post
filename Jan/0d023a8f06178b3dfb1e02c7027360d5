By Ibrahim.abdulazeez Saki (Oyo State) –   Mr Niyi Lawal, the Saki Team Lead of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC), says the energy firm has embarked on rationing of power to Oke- Ogun area of Oyo State due to inadequate supply. Lawal made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Saki. NAN reports that Oke-Ogun area in Oyo North Senatorial District of the state comprises of 11 council areas. According to Lawal, the whole of Oke-Ogun area will need about 54 megawatts to ensure adequate supply. “But what we now have at the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) centre located at Iseyin is a transformer with 19 megawatts capacity. “The initial capacity of the transformer was 30 megawatts, but because it is now old, it can only transmit 19 and that is what we can distribute to consumers in Oke-Ogun and Oyo town with for council areas. “Saki alone needs 19 megawatts, so if we distribute to Saki, it means all others will be in darkness for that period, so, we have to ration what we have,’’ he said. Lawal further disclosed that efforts were on-going to facilitate the establishment of more TCN centres in the bid to boost power supply.  (NAN)
