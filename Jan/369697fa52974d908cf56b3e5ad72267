By Salisu Sani-Idris  Keffi,   –      The Keffi Chapter of National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has expressed shock and sadness over the demised of the Emir of Lafia, Alhaji Isah Mustapha Agwai I. The Chairman of the council, Malam Muhammad Idris, in a statement on Friday, said the demise of the Emir came at a time when his wealth of knowledge was needed to move the state forward. Idris described the late Emir as a symbol of peace and unity reaching far beyond ethnic and religious divides to help foster a united Nasarawa State and Nigeria. Idris said the Emir’s long and remarkable reign that spanned close to half a century brought peace and prosperity to his domain, which was a testimony to his much-revered leadership qualities. “The Keffi Chapter of NYCN commiserates with Gov. Umaru Al-Makura, the immediate family of the late Emir, as well as with the people of Nasarawa State. “NYNC will do everything possible to ensure that his legacies endure in the state in particular and Nigeria at large. “We prayed God to grant eternal rest to the soul of the departed, and give those he left behind the strength to bear the huge loss,“ Idris said. The chairman said that the late Emir would be fondly remembered for his exemplary leadership and tireless efforts at improving the lives of his people. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Emir, who is also the Chairman Nasarawa State Traditional Council of Chiefs, died on Thursday at the age of 84. Alhaji Sule Abubakar, a Senior Cabinet Member and “Ajiyan-Lafia”, confirmed the death of the first class emir in Lafia. Abubakar said the Emir died at a Turkish Teaching hospital in Abuja, following a protracted illness. He said the Emir was coronated on May 28, 1974 and recently marked his 44th anniversary on the throne. His remains would be buried after Jumma’at congregation prayer at Lafia, the Nasarawa state Capital.
