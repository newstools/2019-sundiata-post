By Blessing Odega Jos, – Plateau has recorded 17 confirmed cases of Lassa Fever with five persons killed, according to Dr Kunden Deyin, the state’s health commissioner. Deyin told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Sunday in Jos that 33
cases were taken to the laboratory for confirmation where the 17 were
confirmed to be cases of Lassa Fever. According to him, 13 persons on admission are responding to
treatment, while others have been discharged. He, however, could not
ascertain the number of persons discharged. The commissioner said that 73 persons, who had primary and secondary contacts with the patients, were being monitored. “The 73 persons are currently being monitored. We shall do that for
21 days because the incubation period is from six to 21 days. “After the 21 days, those not affected by the disease will be
discharged from the contact tracing list and certified free of Lassa
Fever.” He advised people with symptoms such as headache, body pain and
general feeling of being unwell, to promptly report for checks, noting
that prompt checks were key to reducing the mortality rates associated
with  the disease. Deyin regretted that patients usually report the matter when it was
too late, and called on health workers to quickly make referrals to
higher health facilities, when they can’t handle cases presented to
them. He advised people to keep environments clean to ward off rodents, while grain stores should be sealed.
