By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described as false the alleged claim by Vice President Yemi that his boss, President Muhammadu Buhari was not aware of the plans by the Executive arm to arraign the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen. The party which insisted that there is no way such high level decision would be taken without the awareness, input and clearance of Mr. President, disclosed this on Wednesday in a statement signed by Director, Media & Publicity,
PDP Presidential Campaign Organization, Kola Ologbondiyan sent to Sundiata Post. Recall that Osinbajo was quoted as saying that President Buhari only got to know about the plans on Saturday and that the Federal Government was saddened by the development. In reaction to this, PDP challenged the Vice President to explain why Mr. President did not stop the arraignment on Monday or said anything on the matter since then. According to PDP,  “If the avowal by Vice President Osinbajo’s was true, then it goes to confirm the assertion that President Buhari is not in charge of governance but has outsourced the responsibilities of his office to unelected individuals due to his incompetence. “Vice President Osinbajo’s assertion has also confirmed the claims by our First Lady, Aisha Buhari that a cabal has taken over the control of the Presidency, for which she forcefully called on Nigerians to take back their country, the statement said. The PDP further noted that the Buhari Presidency is only trying to sway public opinion on the matter following the outrage by Nigerians against the arraignment of the CJN. The party urges all lovers of democracy and rule of law to continue to be on their guard in the defence of our nation against anti-democratic tendencies of the Buhari administration, particularly the clamp down on democratic institutions in our country.
