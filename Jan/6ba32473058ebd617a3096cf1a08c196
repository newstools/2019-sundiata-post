If the Kwankwasiyya crowd I’m seeing daily in Kano state do not split their votes between the governorship and presidential elections then even rigging may not save Buhari in the state. Even if, as I suspect will happen, some of them split their votes, it will still benefit Atiku. I can’t imagine this tsunami that’s about to blow Abdollar Gandollar away not having at least a small knock-on effect on the presidential race in that state. Again, if the race is free and fair, Atiku does not need to win there; he only has to not lose badly. A Kwankwasiyya electoral wave may give him that, depending on whether/how his people and the Abba/Kwankwasiyya people coordinate their campaigns.
