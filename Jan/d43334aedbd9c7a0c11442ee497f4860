By Vivian Ibobo  Ikeja   –      An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court on Friday remanded three teenagers who allegedly used cutlasses and knives to rob two men of money, phones, wristwatch and an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card. The Magistrate, Mrs M. I. Dan-Oni, directed that Emmanuel Sylvester, 18; Faruk Sanusi, 19, and Kamorudeen Sodiq, 19, should be kept at the Kirikiri Prisons along with 20-year-old Adeyemi Olalekan. The four accused persons are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and armed robbery but the court could not take their pleas as Dan-Oni said she needed advice from the state Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The magistrate remanded the accused pending the DPP’s advice. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Insp. Victor Eruada, told the court that the accused committed the offences on Nov. 8 at Aguda, Surulere, Lagos. Eruada said that the accused robbed Messrs Shamusideen Mustapha and Ayo Obasun. According to the prosecutor, the accused robbed Mustapha of N30,000, a Samsung Galaxy phone worth N17,000, an ATM card and a wristwatch. He said that the accused snatched two cell phones worth N12, 500 from Obasun. “Both complainants were coming back from work when the accused threatened them with the cutlasses and knives and dispossessed them of the valuables,” he said. According to the prosecutor, the offences contravene the provisions of Sections 297 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The case was adjourned until Jan. 14, for mention.
