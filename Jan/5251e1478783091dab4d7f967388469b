By Doris Esa Abuja, – The Nigerian Air Force says its Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole has destroyed a Boko Haram logistics base in Sambisa forest, Borno. NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore
Ibikunle Daramola, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. He explained that the operation was carried out on Monday after
series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions
revealed a resurgence of human and vehicular activities at the logistics
base, which had hitherto been abandoned. ” Accordingly, the ATF scrambled two Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet aircraft to attack the location. ” Overhead the target area, several structures and vehicles were seen
camouflaged under the thick vegetation of the Forest, with significant
human activity observed within the area. “The attack aircraft recorded direct hits on the target area
resulting in the destruction of several structures and neutralisation of
some BHTs,” he said. Daramola added that the terrorists, who survived the bomb strikes, were seen fleeing the area. The spokesman said the criminals were mopped-up in follow-on attacks.
