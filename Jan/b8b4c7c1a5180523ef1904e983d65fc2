In Benue, the gubernatorial election is between the PDP’s Governor Ortom, a former stooge of godfather George Akume’s, and the APC’s Emmanuel Jime, the handpicked current stooge of the same godfather. A vote for Jime puts Akume back in charge of our treasury and governmental decision making process. A vote for Ortom is a vote for a failed governor who is now using herdsmen and the pressures of his estranged godfather as excuses for his disastrous tenure. One stooge has been tried and he has failed, godfather’s restrictions or not. He now says he is his own man and now has the freedom to govern accordingly, without the debilitating control of a godfather. Believe him at your own risk. Jime on the other hand cannot escape the rapacious hold of Goerge Akume who wants to make him governor after he fell out with Ortom because he cannot imagine a Benue in which he is not the kingmaker and godfather. Should Benue people reward failure or reward and empower godfatherism? For me, I say neither. If I could vote, I would look towards one of the third party candidates. Source: Facebook
