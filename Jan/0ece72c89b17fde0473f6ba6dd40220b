 By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The United State of America has called for swift resolution of the unconstitutional issued raised by the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria in compliance with rule of law. The U.S embassy in a statement on Saturday expressed deep concern and noted the wide spread condemnation of constitutional breaches the action of the Federal Government has generated. The statement titled “Statement on the Suspension and Replacement of the Chief Justice” reads in full:   “The Embassy of the United States is deeply concerned by the impact of the executive branch’s decision to suspend and replace the Chief Justice and head of the judicial branch without the support of the legislative branch on the eve of national and state elections.   We note widespread Nigerian criticism that this decision is unconstitutional and that it undermines the independence of the judicial branch. That undercuts the stated determination of government, candidates, and political party leaders to ensure that the elections proceed in a way that is free, fair, transparent, and peaceful – leading to a credible result.    We urge that the issues raised by this decision be resolved swiftly and peacefully in accordance with due process, full respect for the rule of law, and the spirit of the Constitution of Nigeria. Such action is needed urgently now to ensure that this decision does not cast a pall over the electoral process.” The U. S Embassy in a statement on Saturday noted the wide spread condemnation of the constitutional condemnational breaches the Federal Government’s action has generated.
