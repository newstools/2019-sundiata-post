By Ariwodola Idowu Ado Ekit – Ahead of the judgment of the Ekiti Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal in Abuja on Monday, the police on Sunday warned politicians  and their followers in the state against unlawful  protests. The Police Commissioner in the state, Mr Asuquo Amba, gave the warning while speaking with newsmen in Ado Ekiti. The commissioner, who was represented by the police spokesman in the
state, DSP Caleb Ikechukwu, said the command would not allow anyone to
destabilise the state under the guise of protests  at  the outcome of
the judgment. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the candidate of the
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the July 14, 2018,  governorship
election, Prof. Kolapo Olusola, had challenged the declaration of Gov.
Kayode Fayemi of the All Progressives Congress(APC)  as the validly
elected governor. Kolapo , who recorded a total of 178,223 votes in the election, had
 alleged irregularities  in the election, won by Fayemi with a total
vote count  of 197, 459 Amba  said the command’s ‘Operation make Ekiti Safe Squad’ was already on ground to tackle any unlawful assembly. “This squad is a Joint Task Force comprising the police and other sister agencies with about 150 men ” They are spread all over the state and being overseen by the
police. So, they are on ground to stop any unlawful assembly or stop any
protest that could result in violence ” Though, people are ready to hold peaceful protest but no one has
written to us now to say that they  would stage any protest over the
judgment ” Even if any group would stage a protest, it won’t be one that will cause riotous assembly or that can be hijacked by hoodlums “Again, whoever loses in the judgment still has the option of appeal,
so violence is not the best option for it won’t be tolerated “On our part, we are ready and we assure our people that there is no cause for alarm,’’  he said.
