By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has
asked its members in Ekiti State not to despair over Monday’s ruling of the
Ekiti Governorship election tribunal as it is confident of victory at the Court
of Appeal. The PDP in a statement signed by its National Publicity
Secretary and Director, Media & Publicity PDP Presidential Campaign Organization, Kola Ologbondiyan
sent to Sundiata  Post. According to the statement, “the judgment of the tribunal
will surely be overturned at the Court of Appeal and victory handed to the PDP
and its candidate, Olusola Eleka, who is the clear winner of the July 14, 2018
Ekiti governorship election. The PDP holds that the Court of Appeal will consider the
matter strictly on its merit particularly with the abounding evidence of
rigging including violence, vote-buying, ballot stuffing and alteration of
results perpetuated by the APC are still intact. Though the judiciary is passing through a trying time under
the dictatorial tendencies of the Buhari Presidency, the PDP urges the Lord
Justices to stand for justice by restoring the mandate freely given to the PDP
candidate, Olusola Eleka, at the July 14, 2018 governorship election in Ekiti
state. The PDP notes that the entire nation and the international
community had widely condemned the manipulation that marred the Ekiti
governorship election and strongly believes that justice will be served at the
end of the day.
