Istanbul – Venezuela’s embattled President Nicolas Maduro rejected an international ultimatum to call elections within eight days and said opposition leader Juan Guaido had violated the country’s constitution by declaring himself leader. Washington, which has recognised Guaido as leader, had on Saturday
urged the world to “pick a side” on Venezuela and financially disconnect
from Maduro’s government. Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro with food shortages and
protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass
emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million per cent this
year. Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said they would recognise
Guaido if Maduro failed to call fresh elections within eight days, an
ultimatum Russia said was “absurd” and the Venezuelan foreign minister
called “childlike.” Washington, Canada most Latin American nations and many European
states have labeled Maduro’s second-term election win last May
fraudulent. Maduro retains the loyalty of the armed forces, although Venezuela’s
top military envoy to the U.S. on Saturday defected to Guaido. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had voiced his support for Maduro in a phone call on Thursday.
