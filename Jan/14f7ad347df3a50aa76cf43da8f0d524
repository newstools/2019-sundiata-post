Adebiyi said after due consultations with his constituents, it was time for him to part ways with the PDP and pitch his tent with the APC. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a gale of defection had hit the lower chamber due to the outcome of party primaries in which many lawmakers failed to get their parties’ tickets for re-election in the forthcoming election.(NAN)
