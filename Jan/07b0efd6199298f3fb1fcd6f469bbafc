By Desmond Amanyi Abuja, – The Coordinator of NYSC in FCT, Mr Bello Balama, said on Thursday that the corps was the agency to handle elections being organised by the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) in the country. Ballama said this during an assessment visit to GSS Wuse, one of the training centres for INEC ad-hoc officials, for the upcoming general elections. He enjoined the corps members to be transparent and patriotic in serving their fatherland. “Worldwide there can be no better organisation that can handle the INEC elections than the NYSC.
“They (electoral empire) used the NYSC in 2011, 2015 repeatedly and even now. “Don’t be compromised, don’t be tempted. What amount of money can
solve your problems at the expense of violence? Don’t invite the
devil,’’ said the coordinator. He also advised the corps members to adhere to the rules no matter how tasking it may be. “Whether it is from 6 a.m to 6 p.m or 24 hours just do what you’re
told. Nigeria in entirety will be proud of your participation towards
nation building,” Ballama said. He however frowned against improper dressing by some corps members and advised them to respect the dress code or risk sanctions.
