President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday, made another gaffe during the presidential campaign rally when he referred to “South-Eastern States” as “East Central State”. Buhari made the blunder while highlighting to the mammoth crowd which gathered at Holy Trinity field in Onitsha, the achievement of his administration in the areas of economy, security and the fight against corruption. He said “I am happy to have commissioned the Zik’s Mausoleum, I am just coming from there now. The road from Enugu to here (Onitsha), which was last done during the Abacha time, is being done again. “We are also working on the Port Harcourt road to this place too, and I believe the minister of Transport (Rotimi Amaechi) has also told you of the railway project, which will also pass from Port Harcourt to Maiduguri, through some of your states in the east-central state.” The development is coming a week after the President, during the presidential campaign rally in Warri, Delta state, addressed Great Ogboru, the state governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as “presidential candidate,” then “senatorial candidate,” then “governortorial candidate”. source:thewhistler.ng
