By Isaac Aregbesola Abuja – All Progressive Congress (APC)-USA Chapter has described Abubakar Atiku’s entry into the U.S. as a mockery of  the country’s stand against foreign officials involved with corruption. The Group said this in a statement jointly signed by its National
Chairman  Prof. Adeshegun Labinjo, BOT Chairman, Judge Dele Alade, and
National Secretary,  Mrs Ronke Ekwensi. “Certainly Atiku’s entry and presence in the US is a mockery of President Bush Presidential Proclamation 7750. “The proclamation affirms the denial of U.S. visa to foreign
officials involved with corruption and other supporting legislations by
the congress,” the group said. The group however, said it did not object to Atiku or any Nigerian
gaining entry into USA, once he or she meets the entry visa requirements
to the country. “However, the questionable character of the individual does not
evaporate. Obviously Atiku has every reason to have kept off the US
given the cloak of corruption he is wearing. “After a long spell of noticeable absence and factual concerns about
Atiku’s antecedents in the US, arising from his dealings with former
Congressman William Jefferson of Louisiana. “Jefferson was convicted and served a jail term, on account of
bribery resulting from a telecommunication transaction in Nigeria, Atiku
is now here again in the U.S,” it stated
. According to the group, Congressional records point to the fact that
Atiku engaged in money laundering through his wife who was then resident
in the U.S. “We see Atiku, who is the 2019 presidential candidate of the PDP in
Nigeria, as a self-centered corrupt Vice President under President
Obasanjo’s regime. “APC-USA believes that Atiku should be held accountable for his involvement in money laundering,” it stated. (NAN)
