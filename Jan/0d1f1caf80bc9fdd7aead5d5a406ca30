Rome –   A migrant rescue ship operated by German Activists in the Mediterranean, has been rescued due to bad weather conditions which led to severe seasickness. The situation has worsened on board as migrants with close quarters and bad weather conditions created flashbacks for those with post-traumatic stress disorder. A storm at sea is now returning, and the ship’s passengers and crew needed a safe harbour, Berlin’s Sea-Watch NGO tweeted on Wednesday. “We do not have the capacity or the recourses (sic) to sustain this situation for much longer,’’ Sea-Watch 3’s medical team wrote in an “urgent request’’ dated Tuesday. The Sea-Watch 3 vessel rescued 32 people in distress at sea off the coast of Libya on Dec. 22, and has since been blocked from docking in Italy or Malta. The migrants rescued include four women, three children and four unaccompanied minors. The storm has forced the ship’s crew to pack the migrants together in a small area below deck. EU states have been at loggerheads on the migration issue, with countries disagreeing over who should assume responsibility for migrants saved at sea.  (dpa/NAN)
