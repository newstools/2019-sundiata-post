By Nathan Nwakamma Yenagoa – Gov. Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa has lauded the Federal Government for the appointment Prof. Nelson Brambaifa as Acting Managing Director, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). A statement by Mr Daniel Iworiso-Markson, Bayelsa Information and Orientation Commissioner made this known on Tuesday in Abuja. Dickson said that the appointment of Brambaifa was in line with the principle of rotating positions among Niger Delta states. NAN recalls that Special Assistant
to President on Media Mr Femi Adeshina on Friday announced the
appointment of the managing director of NDDC alongside other members of
the board of the commission. The governor urged the new NDDC managing director to use his new position to advance the course of development in the state. He also urged him to partner with
the state government to deliver critical road infrastructure that would
position the state for more development. Dickson advised Brambaifa to avoid
politics and be focused on implementing projects that would impact
positively on the Niger Delta people. “He should not behave like some
persons in the past who used their privileged positions at the federal
level to shortchange the state,” he said. He said that Bayelsa had suffered
severe underdevelopment as a result of the attitude of some of its
leaders who played politics with golden opportunities. Dickson assured the new NDDC helmsman of his administration’s support toward achieving the mandate of the commission. “We are watching, we want to see how
the new MD will navigate the ship of the commission away from the murky
waters of politics,” he said. (NAN)
