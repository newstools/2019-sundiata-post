By Victor Adeoti Osogbo –  Gov. Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun has called for religious tolerance, harmony and peaceful co-existence among the people of the state.
Oyetola also urged religious leaders to desist from sermons that could divide the people along religious lines.
He made the call at the New Year Inter-Religious Prayer Service on Wednesday in Osogbo.
The governor noted that religious harmony and cohabitation by people of different faiths was fundamental to the progress and development of the state.
“I want to urge all the people of the state to continue living together in peace, irrespective of their religious and political differences.
“We gathered here today, both Muslims and Christians, to seek the face of God in the beginning of 2019 for the progress of the state.
“We should tolerate ourselves; there should not be religious discrimination and intolerance.
“Our religious leaders should do away with sermons that do not preach unity and harmony among our people. Our God is one; but we are serving Him in different ways,’’ he said.
He, however, called on the people to vote for all the candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 general election.
Oyetola also urged them to be peaceful and orderly before, during and even after the poll.
“We must not allow the people that bastardised the economy of the nation and subjected us to untold hardship to come back,’’ he said.
The Mufasir of Osogboland, Malam Maruf Isola, and President of Osun Baptist Conference, Rev. Paul Kolawole, enjoined the governor to be responsive and sensitive to the plight of the people.
The duo also called on the people to pay their tax regularly to support the government
The Head of Service, Mr Oyegbade Okowogboyega, assured the governor of a supportive and productive civil service, adding that the workers in the state
would support his quest of having a better state. (NAN)
