By Auwalu Yusuf-Birnin Kudu  Daura    –      The Katsina State Basic Universal Education Board (SUBEB) says it has reinstated 22 primary school teachers sacked by the previous administration and paid them arrears of salaries. Malam Lawal Buhari, the Chairman, SUBEB, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Daura on Friday. He said the affected teachers were disengaged from service by the immediate past administration of Gov. Ibrahim Shema for undisclosed reasons. Buhari stressed that the state government checked and crosschecked the affected teachers’ official files but could not find a single query or warning letter issued to them, hence its decision to reabsorb them. “The reengaged teachers were collectively paid a total of N6.5 million as their 10-month salary depending on the individual teacher’s grade level and step in the service at the time. “We paid them salaries from March 2018 to December 2018 as part of our magnanimity and resolve to do justice.’’ The SUBEB boss urged the affected teachers to rededicate and commit to duty, and try as much as possible to reciprocate government’s gesture for extending such hands of compassion to them. Buhari noted that the Katsina State Government had in the last three years constructed 266 additional primary and Junior Secondary Schools and renovated 550 schools. He said that the government had provided the schools with teaching and learning materials to promote education. The SUBEB boss added that within the periods under review, 3,500 additional teachers were recruited and thousands of tem promoted to their next grade levels. “We have sent 5,000 teachers for further training in universities and colleges of education,’’ Buhari said. NAN reports that the state government had last year engaged the services of 5,000 qualified unemployed NCE holders as teachers under its new state power programme tagged, “S-Power’’.
