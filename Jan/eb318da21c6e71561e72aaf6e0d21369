By Gami Tadanyigbe Gwagwalada – Women Friendly Initiative (WFI), an NGO, has called on the Federal Government to boost support for girl-child education to enable them attain their potential. Mrs Rosemary Adaji, the programme officer of the NGO, made the call
in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Gwagwalada on
Thursday. According to her, there is need for the government to invest more in
girl-child education in order to promote nation building and reduce
street begging in some parts of the country. “It is often said that if you educate a woman, you educate the entire society, while if you educate a man, you educate a person. “The girl phenomenon is a less attractive issue, especially their welfare and role in nation building and this is wrong. “Education goes far beyond the four walls of a school, but adequate
empowerment is another category of educating a child,’’ she said. Adaji, explained that, girls in Nigeria are often seen moving around
towns and villages hawking items of paltry value that hardly justifies
the hours spent in the “burning sun.’’ The officer added that there was the need to sensitise the residents of the FCT on the importance of girl-child education “Sometimes girls become vulnerable to harassment from men and other dangerous vices on the streets. “Parents of the girl-child, especially mothers, consider their
daughters as tools for generating income due to poverty and illiteracy
instead of sending them to school,” she said.
