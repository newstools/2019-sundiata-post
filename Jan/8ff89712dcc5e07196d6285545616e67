 By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ Senate has suspended its earlier
plan to reconvene as it has earlier today filed a case in the Supreme court
seeking interpretation onwhether
President Muhammadu Buhari acted within the provision of the constitution in
his suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Hon. Justice Walter
Nkannu Onnoghen or whether the action of the President does amount to
usurpation of the powers of the Senate as provided for in Section 292 of the
constitution. The suspension was in in line with the standing rules of the
Senate not to debate issues that are already pending before the court, as the
matter is now subjudice. The Special Adviser (Media and Publicity) to Senate
President, Yusuph Olaniyonu disclosed this on Monday in a statement sent to
Sundiata Post. The statement reads in full: Earlier today, the Senate filed a case in the highest court
of the land, the Supreme Court, seeking its interpretation on whether President
Muhammadu Buhari acted within the provision of the constitution in his
suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Hon. Justice Walter Nkannu
Onnoghen or whether the action of the President does amount to usurpation of
the powers of the Senate as provided for in Section 292 of the constitution. Following the filing of the case, the matter of the
suspension of the CJN which is the main issue for which the Senate had planned
to reconvene tomorrow, has become subjudiced. Therefore, in line with the standing rules of the Senate not
to debate issues that are already pending before the court, the reconvening of
the Senate tomorrow has been put off. The previous adjournment of the Senate
till February 19, 2019 stays. Signed Yusuph Olaniyonu Special Adviser ( Media and Publicity) to Senate President
