Obasanjo has written another letter warning Nigerians of the massive rigging machine that is about to be unleashed by a desperate Buhari and the cabal and puppeteers that control him. He’s not saying anything we didn’t already know, but many Nigerians are afflicted by Stockholm syndrome. They’re in love with their tormentor, so a reminder every now and then is in order. In all fairness, most Nigerians have wised up to the clear and present danger Buhari poses to Nigeria, so it won’t be their fault if the cabal, assisted by a compromised INEC and security forces, succeed in perpetrating the electoral heist in the works.
