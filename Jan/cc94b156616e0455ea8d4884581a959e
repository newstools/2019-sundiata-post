By.Hassana Yakubu  Kaduna –   In a bid to ensure that electorate do not sell their votes in the forthcoming elections, a group, Grassroots Corruption Fighters, on Thursday stagged a sensitization rally in Kaduna metropolis. The rally, which attracted thousands of participants kicked off from the Murtala Mohammed Square, Kaduna through Independence Way, Waff Road, Ahmadu Bello Way, Alkali Road and back to Murtala Square where it terminated. In an interview with newsmen, National Coordinator of the group, Mubarak Umar said it was organised to sensitize the public on dangers of vote buying. “The grassroots needed to be sensitized on dangers of vote buying. “One of the implications of selling votes is that if you sell your PVC, it could be dumped at a crime scene and you can’t deny your involvement. “We know what we want. It is our right to use our PVC to vote. It is our right we shouldn’t let anybody deceive us. Anybody that has PVC should know that it is more than cash. “We should consider that PVC is what will give us health, water, education and all other basic and social amenities. Consider that PVC is a weapon to use in voting in credible candidates,” he said. Umar explained that they are collaborating with Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), National Orientation Agency (NOA) and other NGOs interested in building democracy in organising the sensitization rally. INEC representative at the rally, Auwal Mashi who is the Kaduna State Administrative Secretary said that the group was doing the right thing. “We believe their objectives are good and they are coming at the right time close to the election,” he said. Present at the rally were top EFCC officials, including Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to EFCC Chairman, Mr Tony Amokeodo and representatives of security agencies, judicuary and INEC officials.
