Military sources told NAN that the report with the headline; “Commander removed as Army moves to retake Baga’’, revealed too much and endangered the planned operation. But in a statement, Manir Dan-Ali, the Editor-In Chief of the newspaper, claimed: “We have not been told of the reason for the military operation against this newspaper but suspect it may have to do with the lead story of the Daily Trust on Sunday that dwelt on the military’s effort to retake some towns recently reported to have been lost to insurgents. “Another clue is that during the invasion of our premises both in Maiduguri and in Abuja, the military men were asking for the reporters who wrote the story. “Media Trust Limited condemns this unlawful act and calls on the military authorities to release the two reporters arrested in Maiduguri and return the dozens of computers that were taken from our newsroom. “We also like to thank our colleagues in the media and all others who have been calling and supporting us in our hour of need. “We also appreciate the efforts of some government officials who insist that there is a better way of handling relations with the media.”’.
