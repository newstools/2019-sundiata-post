Lagos – The Alaba International Market Association on Saturday embarked on a raid against  the sales of substandard electronic products in the market. Addressing newsmen, Public Relations Officer of the association, Mr
Eugene Obiezu, said that the exercise was aimed at curbing the inflow of
substandard goods to the market. According to Obiezu,  the association is poised to stamp out
activities of some notorious traders who imported substandard goods. He said that such practice was smearing the image of the market, saying, “we shall put a stop to it”. Obiezu said the association was worried at the dwindle in sales
volume following the activities of those importing substandard goods
in the market. He said members of the association could not afford to lose their
means of living because of the activities of a few individuals who were
bent on doing illegal businesses. “We will never take it lightly with anyone involved in the sale of
substandard goods, such practice is already having negative effect on
the market. “ We cannot leave the fight against substandard goods in the hands of
government alone; we must take steps to purge ourselves of
wrongdoings,” Obiezu said. Recently, the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) officials, at a sensitisation visit to the market, warned traders against the sales of substandard products. (NAN)
