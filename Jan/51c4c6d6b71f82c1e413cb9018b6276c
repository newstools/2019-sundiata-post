By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), Atiku Abubakar would arrive venue of the presidential debate fresh from United States as he is expected to head straight to the venue as soon as his flight touches down at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport. Atiku has left the United States of America where he has been since Thursday on a shore visit to Nigeria. Atiku touched down on the soil of the God’s Own country for the first time after almost 13 years. During his stay, Atiku had a roundtable with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce where he shared his plan to get Nigeria working again. He is expected to land in Abuja, the nation’s capital, in time for the televised presidential debate scheduled for 7pm Nigerian time. Recall that the ruling All Progressives Congress has been sounding it clear to all who cares to listen that Atiku Abubakar cannot visit the United States of America because of risk of possible arrest over corruption allegation. But the ex-vice president has maintained he has no case to answer.
