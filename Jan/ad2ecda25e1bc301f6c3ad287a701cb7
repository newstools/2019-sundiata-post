One major advantage (and massive one for that matter) APC leaders and the cabal enjoy in the direction the National Conversation has been taking is the DELUSION and ILLUSION already ingrained the psyche of an average Buhari supporter, both on social media and real life, that their man is “fighting corruption” and hence, those around him can never steal! These guys are happy with the WRONG mindset that “stealing ended with PDP”. This has provided them the cover needed to plunder and build a financial war chest ahead of the elections. Ask an average Buhari supporter how their man is financing his campaign, there is this puerile recourse to Providence captured in these prosaic lines: “God is in charge”. Or the more sensible ones will say via donations. Therefore, whenever someone says “those against Buhari want to come back and loot”, these guys just giggle wherever they are. The mental enslavement is going according to script. THEY THEN KNOW, THEREFORE, THAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE BEFORE THEM IS REINFORCING THAT MINDSET. How then do you manage the National Conversation towards changing the WARPED MINDSET of an average Buhari supporter that stealing has not abated? That is where PDP has failed! It is not rocket science. No leader, who has a signature like Buhari has about corruption, has provided his opponents enough ammunition to tear his claims into shreds. His regular photo ops with those hitherto accused of stealing (and obvious state policy of protecting suspected thieves among its ranks) are enough to instigate a massive MIND MODULATION exercise that would effectively change the direction of the National Conversation as far as corruption is concerned. Therefore, that APC still has the temerity to use corruption to campaign is not just an insult to Nigerians but an indication of how poor the opposition is in latching upon REAL NEGATIVES to inflict a mortal political damage on these pretenders holding the levers of power.
