By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ Justice Olabode Rhodes-Vivour may emerge
substantive Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) in the event that the Nigerian
Judicial Commission (NJC) decides to fire the embattled suspended CJN, Justice
Walter Onnoghen and acting CJN, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Mohammed. Rhodes-Vivour is the third most senior Supreme Court Judge. Recall that the NJC has queried the acting CJN, Justice Tanko
Mohammed, few days after his inauguration at the Presidential Villa by
President Muhammadu Buhari. Also queried is the suspended CJN Justice Onnoghen. It was learnt that the two judges were given seven days to
respond to the queries. While Onnoghen was queried following the allegations leveled
against him on his failure to declare all his assets, as stipulated by law, Mohammed
was told to explain why he allowed himself to be sworn-in by President Buhari
without the recommendation of the Council, as required by law. Onnoghen and Mohammed were given seven days to respond to the
query by the NJC.
