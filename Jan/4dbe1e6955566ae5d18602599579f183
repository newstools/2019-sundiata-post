By Ayodeji Alabi Akure –  Gov Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Wednesday assured workers in the state that their welfare would remain top priority, advising them to rededicate themselves to their duties for effective service delivery. Akeredolu gave the assurance at the Annual First Work Day prayer meeting held with the public servants at the Governor’s office. He said that his administration would carry out its obligations to the people and workers despite the lean resources. The governor said the robust support and cooperation received from civil servants in the state since he assumed office was encouraging. Akeredolu, however, said that he would re-engineer the civil service for optimal service delivery and commitment. He also promised to improve on the infrastructural development recorded in 2018. The governor thanked security agents in the state for their efforts to wipe out criminals who had turned bushes to kidnap zones. He urged the people of the state not to panic as efforts were on to address all security challenges. In his sermon titled, ‘Making a Difference’, Bishop Felix Adejumo, General Overseer, Agape Christian Assembly, said he was hopeful of progress, blessings and increase in Ondo State in the New Year. Adejumo, however, urged the workers in the state to change their attitude to work, to add value to the system. Also, Mr Toyin Akinkuotu, the Head of Service, thanked the governor for placing priority on the welfare of workers through prompt payment of salaries and other backlog owed workers by the last administration. He advised the workers to always put in their best in order to move the state forward.  (NAN)
