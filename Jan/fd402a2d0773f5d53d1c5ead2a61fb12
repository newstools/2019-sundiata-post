By Martins Abochol Yola –  The campaign organisations of Malam Nuhu Ribadu and Gov. Mohammed Bindow of Adamawa have fused to work for the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 general elections. Mr Salihu Bawuro, Director-General, Nuhu Ribadu Campaign Organisation, made the disclosure in Yola on Friday when the group paid a visit to Gov. Bindow in his private residence. Bawuro said that the purpose of the visit was to assure the governor of the group’s total loyalty as members of the APC in the state. He said that Ribadu had accepted the fusion of his political structure with the governor’s campaign organisation ‘‘We are pledging our total loyalty and commitment to Gov. Bindow campaign to ensure success for the party at all levels of contest in the general elections. ‘‘We have earlier issued a press statement on our resolve to render total support for the candidature of Gov. Bindow and that the party cannot be divided while facing elections,’’ he said. Also, the Director-General, Black Cap Revolution Movement in the state, Alhaji Aliyu Bello, explained that the movement and Ribadu’s organisation have political structures with executives in all the local government areas. Bello solicited the inclusion of his group in the campaign structure of the party, so as to enhance APC’s chances of winning all elective positions in the coming elections. He dispelled rumours that Ribadu Campaign Organisation would not work for Bindow’s second term bid. Responding, Bindow said that he and Ribadu were in politics to improve on the dilapidated infrastructure in the state, and expressed delight over the meeting. He said that President Muhammadu Buhari had improved security and repaired infrastructure, hence the need for people of the North-East to vote for him in the February election. He promised that members of the Ribadu Campaign Organisation would be given prominent roles to play during the election as well as when the government was formed thereafter. (NAN)
