By Victor Nwachukwu Owerri – Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 General Elections, has restated his commitment to the restructuring of the country if voted into power. Atiku gave the assurance on Tuesday in Owerri, at the South-East Presidential Rally organised by the PDP. He charged the people of the South-East to remain dogged in their
quest for a government that would sympathise with their desires and
aspirations. He further promised to introduce economic policies that would enable
businesses to thrive and give the Igbos their pride of place in the
country. Atiku also assured the South-East of encompassing security
architecture, devoid of ethnic or religious marginalisation, while
charging the people to protect their votes. His words: “We are going to restructure Nigeria and create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive. “Nigeria’s security architecture will involve people from different
zones of the federation because we will enshrine respect for the rule of
law and accommodate everybody. “It will be necessary that you vote and stay because your vote is
your power. Don’t vote and go; stay back and protect your votes,” he
said. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the rally which held at the
Dan Anyim Stadium, attracted a mammoth crowd of supporters. The highlight of the occasion was the presentation of flags to all
the South-East governorship candidates on the platform of the PDP. Among those in attendance are the party’s Vice Presidential
Candidate,  Mr Peter Obi, Senate President,  Bukola Saraki and National
Chairman of the PDP,  Uche Sekondus, among others. (NAN)
