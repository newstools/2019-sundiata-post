By Henry Oladele Lagos – The Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre (NAFRC) in Lagos on Tuesday commenced a four week training on entrepreneurship and management skills for a group of retiring military officers. Speaking at the opening, NAFRC Commandant, Air Vice Marshal Abubakar
Liman, said that the training was aimed at refocusing attention of the
middle cadre officers from their military lives. “The aim of the programme is basically to refocus attention of middle
cadre officers to the fact that a meaningful and productive life can
still be pursued while in service and after retirement. “In the next four weeks, they will be taken through various modules in the entrepreneurship and management field. “Some of these modules include entrepreneurship and agriculture,
business plan and model, fundamentals of business laws and taxation as
well as human supply chain management and marketing,” he said. He said the training also entailed a study tour to Songhai Farm in
Porto Novo, Benin Republic to  expose them to the opportunities in the
agro allied sector. Earlier, Director of Training, Brig.-Gen. Dominic Onyemulu, said the
course was designed for 35 participants while 16 assembled for the
inauguration. “The assembled participants comprise two officers from the Nigerian Army, six from the Navy and eight from the AirForce. “This is an inaugural course for mid-level officers of the Armed
Forces of Nigeria. The course is for officers who have served for 15 to
20 years in the AFN,” he said. He said the commandant directed the training to impact vital skills
that would enhance the job performance as well as enable them to manage
their various welfare programmes. (NAN)
