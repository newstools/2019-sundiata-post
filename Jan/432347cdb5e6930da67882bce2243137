By Abdullahi Shugaba Dutse – Mr Haladu Wazam, the Chairman of Kalawa Development Association, Ringim Local Govrrnment Area, has appealed to Gov. Muhammad Badaru of Jigawa to build good road and basic social amenities for the community. Wazam made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Dutse on Wednesday. He said that the measure would help to address the transportation problem in the area and make life more meaningful for the natives. He said that Kalawa was an agrarian community blessed with huge agricultural potential but described the lack of good road as the major challenge confronting the natives. Wazam said that the people found it difficult to evacuate their farm produce to the cities because of the deplorable condition of the community road. “Consequently, most of our farm produce are usually left to perish. “Also, many of our young people have abandoned the village for towns and cities because of the lack of good road. “We believe that the governor can reverse the trend if he builds our road and provide social amenities for our people. “This will make our young people to stay back in the village and engage fully in agriculture,” Wazam said. He further appealed to the governor to build a school and health care facility for the community. He said, “Apart from road, we will be happy if the governor will also build a school and hospital for us. “As I am talking with you, we don’t have a school and hospital in our place. This is why our women often died during labour. “I am therefore appealing to the governor to come to our aid and rescue us from this predicament,” Wazam said (
