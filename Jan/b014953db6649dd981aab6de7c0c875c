By Mustapha Sumaila Abuja – Civil Servants in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Tuesday lauded Federal Government over the announcement of a new minimum wage for workers in the country. A cross section of civil servants
who spoke to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on said that the
development was a step in the right direction. The National Council of State at its
meeting on Tuesday approved N30, 000 minimum wage for Federal
Government workers and N27, 000 for workers in state governments’ and
private organisations’ employment. The council upheld the
recommendation of the Tripartite Committee on Review of National Minimum
Wage, headed by former Head of Service of the Federation, Ms Ama
Pepple. One of the civil servants, Mrs
Jamila Suleiman, expressed joy on the new minimum wage, saying that the
increment would make a difference in her salary, no matter how little. Malam Ibrahim Shuaib, another civil
servant with Federal Ministry of Finance, also expressed happiness over
the development, but said that the government should addressed the
problem of harmonisation of salary structure of federal public servants. Shuaib appealed to the government to look into the issues “for fairness and equity’’. Mr John Uzor, a private sector
employee, also expressed joy over the new wage, saying that the
government under President Muhamnadu Buhari should be commended on this
development. Uzor appealed to the government and labour leaders to ensure that private firms complied with the payment of new wage. Mrs Lami Omale, a civil servant with
Federal Capital Territory Administration said that it was a good step
taken by the government. Omale, however, stated that N30, 000
was not sufficient and said that that there was need for constant
review of the salary. (NAN)
