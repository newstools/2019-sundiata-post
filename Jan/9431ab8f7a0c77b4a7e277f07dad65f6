By Racheal Ishaya Abuja –  The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has sustained its intervention in the Inter-Bank Foreign Exchange Market by injecting 210 million dollars into the various segments of the market. The Director, Corporate Communications, CBN, Mr Isaac Okorafor, on Tuesday in Abuja, said the apex bank offered 100 million dollars as wholesale interventions and allocated 55 million dollars to Small and Medium Enterprises. Okorafor said another 55 million dollars was allocated to customers requiring foreign exchange for business and personal travels, tuition or medical fees, among others. The CBN spokesman said the bank was pleased with the performance of the naira because it had continued to enjoy stability against the dollar and other major currencies of the world in recent times. He reassured the public that the CBN would continue to intervene in the interbank foreign exchange market to ensure liquidity in the foreign exchange market and maintain stability. On the Bank’s restriction of access to foreign exchange for some 42 items, he said the policy would continue, particularly as it was greatly boosting local production of items on the list. He disclosed that the Economic Intelligence Unit of the CBN was working closely with relevant government agencies to checkmate any attempt to flout the policy. Meanwhile, the naira on Tuesday exchange for N358 to a dollar at the Bureau De Change segment of the market. (NAN)
