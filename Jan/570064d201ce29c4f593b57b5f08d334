…Reminds
of  Preparedness to Conduct Election By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Independent National Election Commission (INEC) has reiterated it earlier position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State is not eligible to field candidates for the National Assembly, Governorship and State Assembly in the 2019 general election. The INEC also expressed satisfaction with the overall
preparaedness for the 2019 general elections. The commission further reminded that a meeting with all the
Residence Electoral Commissioners will take place next week to further review
the state of preparedness of each state. INEC disclosed this on Wednesday in a statement signed by the  National Commissioner and Chairman,
Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr Festus Okoye made available to newsmen. The commission said it has reviewed the situation concerning
the All Progressives Congress fielding candidates for the Governorship and
state Assembly elections in Zamfara state and noted that there are two court
judgements on the matter- one from a state High Court in Gusau and the other
from the a Federal High Court in Abuja. The former judgement clearly said that
the APC conducted primaries in Zamfara State, contrary to the position of the
commission. On the other hand, the Federal High Court in Abuja ruled that the
party did not conduct valid primaries and therefore is ineligible to field candidates
for the elections. The Independent National Electoral Commission also
reaffirmed its commitment to obeying all court judgements, even when it
disagrees with them, stressed that these are clearly two contradictory judgments
delivered by two courts of coordinate jurisdiction.
