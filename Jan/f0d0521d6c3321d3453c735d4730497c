By Afusat Agunbiade-Oladipo  Ilorin   –      An Ilorin-based legal practitioner, Mr Suleiman Isiaka, has identified lack of understanding among couples as the major cause of divorce in Nigeria. Isiaka told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday at Ilorin that “understanding is a basic ingredient for a successful marriage, but unfortunately, this is lacking among couples.’’ According to him, young couples rush into marriage without understanding one another and that would always lead to break-up in young marriages. The legal practitioner, therefore, advised intending couples to take time to study and understand each other for marriage to succeed. This, he said, became necessary so that both husband and wife would not be disappointed at the end of the day. He also blamed parents who force their children into marriage and impose spouses on them, saying this accounted for the high rate of divorce among young couples. “Parents should learn not to force any partner on their children because it would lead to a bad relationship “ Parents should prepare their children’s mind for marriage from age 20 because children these days prepare for marriage early,’’ he said. He also urged the government and religious leaders to organise regular marriage seminar for the youths in order to orientate and prepare them for marriage.
