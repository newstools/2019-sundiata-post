By Monday Ajogun Benin – Edo Government says it will look at ways of assisting victims of Friday’s tanker fire outbreak at Ugbowo, opposite the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH). Deputy Gov. Philip Shaibu made the promise when he came to the scene of the accident to assess the situation. Shaibu urged road users to respect traffic laws to avoid accidents. He called on the Federal Government to expedite actions on rail line
construction across the country to reduce the number of  articulated
vehicles on the roads. He gave the assurance that the state government would embark on more
campaigns against traffic rule violation and crusades for proper
enforcement of traffic laws. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the tanker and two cars were burnt besides five cars belonging to a car dealer. The seller of the cars, Mr Kelvin Akhigbe, regretted his losses, appealing to governments to come to his aid.
