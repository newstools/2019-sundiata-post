Wike stated that the State Government had also delivered a 32-seater coaster bus to them, to ease the transportation challenges facing them. He noted that the state government had to honour the legacy of both the past and present members of the nation’s armed forces, who had either served or still serving for their contributions to the course of peace and national cohesion. The governor stressed that Nigeria deserved a total defeat of Boko Haram instead of technical defeat. “The Federal Government, therefore, needs to do something more pragmatic to boost the morale of our troupes, reverse the embarrassing setbacks and defeat Boko Haram,’’ he added.
