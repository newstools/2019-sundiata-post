Osinbajo made the remarks during his visit to the palace of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, in Ile-Ife. The vice-president said that the President had been trying his best to make the country develop in all aspects. “Everybody knows that Buhari is good, kind, diligent, trustworthy, faithful and incorruptible, instead for him to embezzle, he generates fund and fights corruption across the country. “Any country that will progress, requires good leadership like that of Buhari,” Osinbajo said.
