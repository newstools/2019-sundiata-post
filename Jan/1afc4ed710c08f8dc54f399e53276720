By Rita Iliya Minna – The Niger Government has constituted a special education committee to supervise and ensure the maintenance of school facilities across the state’s 25 local government areas. Alhaji Alhassan Nworu, the Chairman, Niger state Universal Basic
Education (SUBEB), made this disclosure in an interview with the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna on Thursday. He disclosed that the committee was constituted by the Gov. Abubakar
Bello to ensure that the facilities, especially in primary schools, are
properly maintained. “This administration since inception, has invested a lot in
education. When we took over government in 2015, the education sector,
especially primary school arm was at the edge of collapse. “This government started with school renovation and provision of
furniture, both for pupils and teachers to make teaching and learning
easier. “We now have a standing committee consisting of retired teachers with
great experience in education, specially selected to assist government
in ensuring that these facilities are well maintained”. According to him, the committee is also expected to supervise the
facilities to see what is needed and what area needs more intervention,
so as to provide a conducive teaching and learning environment. Nworu said that the state government had employed new primary school
teachers, as part of the efforts to provide qualitative education in the
state. He noted that the administration would continue to prioritise education and the welfare of teachers.
