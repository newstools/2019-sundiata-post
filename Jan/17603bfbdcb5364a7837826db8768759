The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the club defeated Oluyole Warriors 1-0 at the ongoing Nigeria National League (NNL) Super 8 in Aba. Bendel Insurance was relegated to the Nigeria National League (NNL) 10 seasons ago. Teams for the Super 8 are made of four clubs each from the Northern and Southern Conferences. Clubs in the Northern Conference are Kada City, Kogi United, Real Stars FC and Gombe United FC. For the Southern Conference are Bendel Insurance, Remo Stars, Shooting Stars and Delta Force FC. The Edo-based team was, however, able to secure three straight wins from the Southern Conference after it defeated Delta Force 3-0 and Remo Stars by 1-0. The team’s Media Officer, Harrison Iyunmana, told NAN that the team was in celebration mood as the promotion was important to the state. “We thank God for the support of the state government, for its motivation and kudos to the players for believing in themselves. “The deputy governor had charged the players not to rest on their oars until they return to playing continental competitions. “We want to bring back continental football to Edo State,” he said. Bendel Insurance will now compete in the NPFL which starts on Sunday, Jan. 13. (NAN)
