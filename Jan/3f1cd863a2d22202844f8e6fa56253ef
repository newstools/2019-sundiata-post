By Ruona Isikeh Benin – Mr Adebayo Ojo, the Coordinator, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Edo, has advised corps members in the state to display neutrality while on duty during the forthcoming general elections. Ojo gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria
(NAN) after a meeting with NYSC members at the scheme’s zonal office in
Oredo, Benin, on Thursday. He said that as youths serving the nation, corps members should always show good examples to influence the society positively. “Vices such as: drugs abuse, internet fraud, robbery and bribery should be no go areas for our corps members. “As they will be deployed to work during the elections in various
parts of the state, it is my honest advice to them that they must serve
the electoral process with dignity,” he said. Ojo urged those that would be deployed in the conduct of the elections to show obedience to the rules governing the process. “I want the NYSC members to always be good ambassadors of the scheme,
they must be seen standing up for the country that they serve. “We have told them to wear the NYSC uniforms always and to display their NYSC identity cards for proper recognition,” Ojo said. NAN reports that a total of 7,000 corps members will be deployed as
ad-hoc staff to all local government areas in Edo for the conduct of the
general elections.
