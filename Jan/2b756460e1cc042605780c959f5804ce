By Muhammad Nasir Bello  Sokoto    –     The Sokoto state House of Assembly on Wednesday adopted report of the House Committee on Education on a bill to establish the College of Nursing Sciences in Tambuwal. The Committee Chairman, Aminu Bala, (PDP- Bodinga South), who presented the report at plenary, said that the bill sought to establish a new college of nursing science in the state. “The reason is not far from the fact that there is the need to bridge the gap that exists as a result of the shortage of the required manpower in the state hospitals especially in nursing related fields. “It is pertinent to note that the College of Nursing Science Sokoto cannot provide the needed manpower required in the state. “This was largely due to the limited number of students allocated to every college in a year by the regulatory council,” he said. Bala further said that the committee at a stakeholders meeting discussed extensively on the content of the bill. “This is to recommend that the title of the bill be amended to reflect College of Nursing Science instead of ‘Midwifery Science. “This is to enable broader concept that covers all Nursing Science including Midwifery rather than limiting to provide training and research in Midwifery. “That the minimum qualification of the Provost should be a Master’s Degree in Nursing Science instead of Degree in Nursing as provided in the bill. “This was also the new standard adopted by the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN) in order not to just upgrade the standard, but equally encourage people to go for higher degrees,” he added. The Deputy Speaker, Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, who presided over the sitting said, “the recommendations of the committee were considered and remained part of the report.”
