By Christian Ogbonna Yenagoa – Gov. Seriake Dickson of Baylesa, has donated additional 500 mattresses to the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members serving in state. Dickson said this was part of his administration efforts at improving the welfare of corps members in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Dickson was represented by
his Senior Special Assistant on NYSC Matters, Mr Kelvin Appah, at the
handing over ceremony of the mattresses in Yenagoa on Monday. “I remember sometime in 2018, the Governor also donated a total of 200 mattresses to Corps Members’ lodges in the state. “I believe the donation of 500 mattresses today will make it a total
of 700 mattresses released to the scheme for the comfort of these
patriots. “We are doing this because we are proud of NYSC’s quality service to the state,’’ Appah said. Receiving the mattresses, Mrs Loto Bolade, Bayelsa’s NYSC Coordinator, thanked the governor for the support towards the scheme. Bolade also commended the governor on the improved security and
welfare of corps members in the state and urged them to reciprocate the
governor’s gestures by rendering selfless service to the state. “You must redouble your services to the state in your places of
primary assignments, especially in community development services. “On behalf of the NYSC Director General, I thank the State Governor,
the Secretary to the State Government, the Chairman, NYSC State
Governing Board and SSA to the Governor on NYSC Matters, for their
support to Corps Members,’’ Bolade said. (NAN)
