If we talk now, my dear brother, Sir Kennedy Emetulu, will carry koboko and claim that any observation not in favor of Atiku is aiding and abetting the enemy. While readying my yansh for his koboko, I will go ahead and make this observation anyway. I finally watched that debate video and concluded the obvious: cognitive disability. This is nothing new to even the most avid Buharideen. It’s something they whisper and hush hush among themselves while wailing the opposite in public. Enter Atiku Abubakar to change the topic with his triumphal entry into Washington DC. In Atiku’s shoes, I’d have waited a week and allowed my opponent and his supporters twist and contort themselves beyond recognition while screaming that cognitive disability is not cognitive disability. I’d have watched them sap valuable energy coping with an orgy of bad press but what do I know? With this unexpected gift of change of topic, any Buharideen still abusing Atiku is an ingrate. Bi e ba mo re ni ko ye ke bu rara. Now you can loud it and use Washington landing to cover cognitive disability in a land where news has only a 5-minute staying power. These are interesting times.
