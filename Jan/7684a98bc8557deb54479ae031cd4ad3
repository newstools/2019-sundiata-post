By Shuaib Sadiq Kaduna – Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the PDP Presidential Candidate, has promised to bring prosperity to Nigerians if voted into power on Feb. 16. Abubakar, who addressed a campaign rally on Thursday in Kaduna, said that there was no hunger and poverty  among Nigerians when the PDP was in power. He alleged that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), had failed to fulfill the promises it made to Nigerians in 2015, and urged the electorate to vote the PDP back to power “to return the nation back to the path of progress”. Atiku said that APC’s promise to tackle insecurity had not been fulfilled. “The security challenges in most parts of the country are still there. Nigerians should vote the PDP in all elections so that the lingering issues will be tackled,” he said. He claimed that the PDP was responsible for most developments in the country, saying that the change promised by the APC was still mirage. Earlier, the National Chairman of the party, Mr Uche Secondus, had said that President Muhammadu Buhari had tried his best but could no longer rule over more than 200 million people. He urged PDP supporters to vote the party’s candidates in all elections, saying that the nation would be better off if the party returned to power. Dr Bukola Saraki, Senate President and Director-General of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council, said that the APC did not deserve a second tenure because it had failed to fulfill its promises, especially in the area of security. He said that the nation’s economy was currently in the woods, and regretted that Nigeria had been declared as the capital of poverty. Saraki urged Nigerians to vote for the PDP in all elections so as to return the nation back to the path of growth and  progress. “Atiku has the capacity to deliver and provide jobs; he is the man that understands and can deliver,” he said. (NAN)
