Timeline: Saturday January 19, 2019: “Presidency is not aware of any petition against Walter Onnoghen, the CJN.” “I challenge anyone to tell me where the President gave any instruction that the CJN be tried or petitioned.” Friday January 25, 2019: President Buhari, acting on the outcome of the petition to the CCT that HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT, suspended the CJN! My Take:
A nation gets the kind of leadership it deserves. American deserved Trump, they got him. France deserved Macron, they got him. Nigeria DESIRED Buhari, they have him! Important Notice:
This post does NOT, in any way, exonerate the CJN who must explain to Nigerians how he came about the properties and monies traced to him. We must interrogate that if truly we want a better Nigeria. If Onnoghen must come to equity, his hands must not be soiled. He played into the hands of these deplorable and shameless APC hawks! Source: Facebook
