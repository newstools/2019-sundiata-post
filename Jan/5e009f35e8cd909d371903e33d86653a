 By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Presidential candidate of the Young
Progressives Congress (YPP), Mr Kingsley Moghalu has blasted President
Muhammadu Buhari and former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar for absconding the Presidential
debate. The presidential candidate of the YPP, alleged that the non-participation
of the duo in the debate was simply “arrogance” coupled with the fact that “they
could not answer the questions that will be posed to them”. According to Moghalu, the ruling party APC and the major opposition
party PDP candidates refused to come for the debate due to their arrogance and
simply because they could not be able to answer the questions as to why they
want to govern the people. Stressing that one is kettle while the other is the
pot- referring to APC and PDP. He stated this while reacting to question as to why he
thinks the two main contending parties decided to stay away from the debate. Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Dr Oby Ezekwesili
while reacting to the question said, “It simply means that they have excused
themselves from the race. She continued: Pride goes before a fall and it means. On his part, the Allied for New Nigeria (ANN) Presidential
candidate, Mr Fela Durotonye said that the attitude of the two presidential
candidates goes to confirm that they are above the people that they are not
going to be answerable to them but to lord over them. Recall that both President Muhammadu Buhari of the APC and
Atiku  Abubakar of the PDP did not
participate in the presidential debate that held in Abuja on Saturday. The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party
(PDP) Atiku Abubakar who cut short his trip to United States of America and
returned to the country on Saturday was sighted at the venue of the event but
later decided not take part in the debate.
