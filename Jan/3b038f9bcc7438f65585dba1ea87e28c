Washington – North Korea is unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons capabilities in spite of recent moves indicating it was open to such actions, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said on Tuesday. Coats’ assessment, in testimony
before a Senate panel, clashed with President Donald Trump’s periodic
upbeat assessments of North Korea’s commitment to denuclearisation since
his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. Coats said North Korea has halted
its provocative behaviour related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD),
has not conducted any nuclear missile tests in more than a year and has
dismantled some of its nuclear infrastructure. And Kim continues to demonstrate
openness to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, Coats said in
testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee. “Having said that, we currently
assess that North Korea will seek to retain its WMD capabilities and is
unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production
capabilities. “The North Korea leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival,” Coats said. “Our assessment is bolstered by our
observations of some activity that is inconsistent with full
denuclearisation,” he said. (Reuters/NAN)
