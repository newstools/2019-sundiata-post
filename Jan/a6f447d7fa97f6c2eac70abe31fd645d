I know it’s political campaign season, and politicians like to invent and exploit differences for their personal, self-interested gains. APC politicians and their mentally low-wattage minions, for example, interminably whine about “16 years of PDP misrule” and make it seem like they’re exempt from this bogeyman they’ve created. PDP politicians, on the other hand, talk of their APC counterparts as if they are cut from different ideological cloth. That’s just silly, intentionally duplicitous binarism. Consider this, for instance: All former living PDP chairmen, except Ahmadu Ali (for now), are now in APC. If you need reminding, they are Audu Ogbe, Adamu Mu’azu, Modu Sheriff, Vincent Ogbulafor, Bamanga Tukur, and Okwesilieze Nwodo (?). Barnabas Gemade, another past PDP chairman, was elected senator on the platform of the APC, but he has now defected to SDP. It can’t get more PDP than that. Atiku Abubakar and Bukola Saraki used to be APC honchos; they’re now the main characters in the movie of PDP politics. (Before they became APC honchos, they were PDP gaffers). Vote for people, not parties. Nigeria has no tradition of ideologically rooted political parties like societies in the West do. Source: Facebook
