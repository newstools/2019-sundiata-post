By Aisha Gambo Kaduna – The National Orientation Agency (NOA) on Friday took its Voter Education Campaign to residents of Kubau Local Government Area (LGA) of Kaduna State. The campaign was aimed at educating the electorate on the proper way to vote in the upcoming elections. The State Director, NOA, Galadima Zubair-Soba, said that the campaign was to ensure that the electorate voted the right way in order to make their votes count. “History has shown that in successive elections, there have been issues of invalid votes as a result of incorrect voting by the electorate,” he noted. He explained that the electorate must not vote for two parties, should not thumbprint outside the space and should not write on the ballot paper so that the votes would not be voided. Zubair-Soba called on women not to design henna (tatoo) on their fingers in order to be captured well by the electronic card reader used in accrediting voters. The state director noted that similar campaigns would be organised in each political ward in the state to ensure that the electorate was duly enlightened. He urged Kaduna residents to come out en- mass and vote for credible leaders who would serve them better and shun politics of sentiment. The NOA boss also implored politicians to desist from acts that could cause division and set the people against one another, advising youths to shun political violence. Earlier, The Chairman, Kubau LGA, Sabo Aminu, who was represented by Ja’afar Adamu, promised to collaborate with NOA on the exercise. He urged traditional and religious leaders in the area to disseminate the message to their subjects and followers who were not present during the campaign. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that stakeholders from different walks of life were in attendance. Songs and drama were also presented to buttress the proper way of voting for easy comprehension.
