By Bukola Adetoye  Lagos   –     The President, Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN), says the financial institution remains committed to the growth of the industry in Nigeria. Efekoha stated this on Wednesday in a goodwill message to members during a meeting in Lagos to usher in 2019. “On behalf of the Governing Council, I convey best wishes to distinguished members in appreciation of their concerted efforts in moving the institute to greater heights in 2018. “As a body, we are committed to the growth of the Nigerian Insurance Industry and will not relent in our contribution to its agenda. “We have entered 2019, which is so special because the institute will be 60 this year. “2019 will be a year of reflection on the Institute’s journey through the years and its evolution as the premier professional body in Nigeria,” he said. He said CIIN had collaborated with stakeholders to explore all avenues in re-positioning the insurance industry for greater relevance in the country’s economy by advocating for ethical practice and professional development. “This is consistent with our mission to provide world-class manpower with the highest standard of professional and ethical training for effective operations in the country and international business environment,” he said. Efekoha also noted 2019 might pose some challenges for the sector being an election year. He, however, said there would be a lot of risk elements for Insurance outfits to take advantage of. “My advice to underwriters is to explore all areas of business generation that the election year will present in various forms,” he said.
