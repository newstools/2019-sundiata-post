Away from politics. During the 2008/09 season, Liverpool and Arsenal played the Game of the Season in an eight-goal thriller on April 21, 2009 at Anfield. It ended Liverpool 4-4 Arsenal. In other words, the two teams went home with TWO points shared ONE apiece. Same season, Manchester United, who eventually won the league, won ELEVEN matches by 1-0 scoreline. In other words, they garnered THIRTY-THREE points scoring ELEVEN goals. Yet, Liverpool and Arsenal both scored EIGHT goals in ONE match but gaining just TWO points. Moral: Learn how to win ugly, struggle for points but ultimately getting over the line. It can never be scintillating soccer all season. Who can do that in 2018/19 season? City or The Kop?
