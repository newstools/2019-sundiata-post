By Polycarp Auta  Jos –   Mr Gyang Buba, the Gbong Gwom of Jos has, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to ensure that the forthcoming general elections were fair, credible and acceptable to Nigerians. Buba, who is the Chairman, Plateau Council of Traditional Rulers, gave the advice on Thursday in Jos, in an interactive session with traditional rulers. The session was organised by INEC to rub minds with the monarchs on measures toward a peaceful and credible election. . The paramount ruler, who commended INEC for putting all modalities in place for the conduct of the polls, said that Plateau had passed through turbulent times and would not want another round of violence. Buba called on Plateau residents to be orderly during the elections, saying that their attitude would determine whether the polls would come and pass peacefully. Also speaking, Miskoom Martin Sheldas, the Long Goemai of Shendam, urged the electoral umpire to ensure timely arrival of voting materials on election days so as not to disenfranchise voters, particularly those in difficult terrains. He also urged the electoral body to guard against under-age voting, noting that such would discredit the exercise. Earlier, Mallam Halilu Pai, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), had said that the interactive season was to acquaint the traditional rulers with INEC’s level of preparations for the polls. “Traditional rulers play key role in the society; they have direct connection with the people at the rural areas. This meeting is to acquaint you with our level of preparations and urge you to sensitise your subjects on the need to collect their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs),” he said.  (NAN)
