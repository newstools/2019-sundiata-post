By Raji Rasak  Badagry    –        The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Badagry-Seme Command, on Wednesday urged the Federal Government to establish Trans-Border Traffic Control to check the influx of bad trucks coming into the country. The Unit Commander, Mr Fatai Bakare, gave the advice on Wednesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Badagry, Lagos State. “If you get to Seme now, it will be difficult for you to believe the kind of bad trucks bringing goods into the country. “These are the kinds of trucks that cause crash or accident on the roads. “Some of the trucks’ drivers coming with goods do not understand English Language, and it is extremely difficult to explain things to them. “Most of the time, we have to look out for a mechanism to educate and enlighten these drivers on their excesses on the road. “The Federal Government should create a different traffic control that will be dealing with their excesses to reduce accidents and break down of these trucks on our major roads,’’ he said. Bakare, however, said the rate of accidents on Badagry Expressway had reduced to zero level, adding that the unit did not record any fatal accident in December. “When I was posted here three years ago, I was baptised with crash that took away 12 lives. It was a head-on collision. “But, it is over now because the enforcement level of the unit is high. The fear of road safety corps along this route is the begging of wisdom. “We are happy for that and hope to maintain and sustain it. We will not fall back to those black days of doing rescue missions everyday,’’ he said. Bakare, who was just promoted to the Deputy Corps Commander, urged the staff under his unit to be hardworking and dedicated to work. “The junior officers should understand that you cannot continue to work diligently without reward from the service. “I encourage you all to be faithful and dedicated to your work according to the rules and regulations of the corps,’’ he said.
