By Akeem Abas Ibadan –   Mrs Hannah Ogunesan, the Oyo State Head of Service, has charged workers in the state to rededicate themselves toward delivery of excellent service. Ogunesan spoke with newsmen on Wednesday in Ibadan as the workers resumed from the New Year holidays. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) correspondent who went round the ministries reports that workers in the state were seen at their duty posts with the zeal to work. NAN reports that workers in the state received their December salary before the Christmas and New Year break. Ogunesan said the government expected the workers rededicate themselves to work towards the delivery of excellent service in the New Year. “You have gone round the ministries and can see that the offices are filled up. “You can see that our workers are ready for work after the Christmas and New Year break,’’ she said. The head of service said the zeal to work by the civil servant in the state would ensure good service delivery. Meanwhile, Mr Oyewole Oyewunmi, the State Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources, called on the workers to justify the welfare policies of the government. Oyewunmi, who spoke at the New Year prayer session held at the ministry, said that government would not relent in creating conducive environment for workers to give their best. He said such environment would enable them to sustain the state’s status as pacesetter in the country.  (NAN)
