By Adedeji Egbebi  Ikole-Ekiti    –      The‎ newly-appointed Coordinating Director for Ikole Local Government in Ekiti, Mr Gabriel Fasanmi, has advised the council’s residents to pay their taxes promptly in 2019. Fasanmi said this would boost the council’s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). The director made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in I‎kole-Ekiti on Tuesday after holding a meeting with the council’s revenue collectors. He said that his appointment by Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti was to improve the socioeconomic development and the welfare of the people of the area. Fasanmi said without collecting internally generated revenue, the management of the council would not be able to develop and maintain the infrastructure within the local government area. Fasanmi said that under the past administrations, the revenue generated by the local government was not very encouraging. He said that this was because some individuals had taken over most of the areas where the council was generating its IGR. “ The administration of Gov. Kayode Fayemi will not tolerate such greedy and selfish acts from anybody. “This is the major reason why I am grateful to Gov. Fayemi for appointing me as the coordinating director for Ikole Local Government, so as to curb all forms of corruption in the council,” he said. The director appealed to traders, commercial drivers, timber workers and contractors to cooperate with all the council’s revenue collectors. He assured both the residents and artisans in the council area that the state government would provide them all the facilities they would need for their wellbeing.‎
