By David Adeoye Ibadan â€“ Ahead of the forthcoming general elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Wednesday began the training of 520 supervisory presiding officers (SPOs) in Oyo state in Ibadan. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the three-day training will equip the personnel to effectively perform their duties during the elections in Oyo state. Addressing the participants, Mr Mutiu Agboke, the Resident Electoral
Commissioner (REC) in the state, urged them to take the training
seriously and listen attentively to the trainers. He said that all the 520 participants would be tested after the
training and only the best 478 would be recruited as supervisory
presiding officers for the general elections. The REC stressed that performance of the SPOs would enhance the overall performance of the commission during the elections. He, therefore, implored them to see the training as an opportunity to
be more informed and educated on their impending assignment. Agboke reiterated the readiness of INEC to conduct credible polls and
assured the electorate that their votes would determine who would
govern or represent them after the elections. He called on those who were yet to collect their permanent voter
cards to visit the nearest local government INEC office to do so but
warned that there would not be collection by proxy.
