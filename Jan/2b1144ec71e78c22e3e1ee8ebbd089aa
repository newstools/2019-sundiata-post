By Hassana Yakubu Kaduna – The Coalition of Arewa Youths Groups, on Monday held a rally in Kaduna in support of the suspension of Justice Walter Onnoghen, erstwhile Chief Justice of Nigeria over allegations of false assets declaration. President Muhammadu Buhari suspended Onnoghen on Friday and appointed
Justice Mohammed Tanko in acting capacity pending the conclusion of
Onnoghen’s trial before the Code of Conduct Tribunal. The action has generated heated debate across the country on the legality or otherwise of the action taken by the President. However, Ahmed Ibrahim, who read the speech of the coalition, said
Buhari was right in his action, stressing that it would send strong
signals “down the line” to those still enmeshed in corrupt practices. The coalition added: “It is most disheartening that some people have decided to politicize corruption. “Those that have turned a clear court case of corruption into a
political issue by claiming that the suspension of the CJN was meant to
incapacitate the opposition are not been fair to the rest of us.” The coalition also dismissed those imputing religion into the
Onnoghen case as ungodly, saying “all faiths condemn bribe taking, false
declaration and duplicity.” They urged President Buhari not to relent in his pursuit of corrupt public officers including those in the judiciary. The northern youths said Nigerians should allow the law to take its full course with regards to the case against Onnoghen. “Let Mr president note that this critical mass of Nigerians are
behind him; that the mandate they have given him to clean the country of
sleaze cannot be undermined by corrupt politicians even if they
successfully recruit other countries to swell their ranks.”(NAN)
