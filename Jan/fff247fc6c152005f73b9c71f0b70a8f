By Saidu Adamu  Wukari (Taraba) –  Hoodlums in Wukari, Taraba, on Thursday attacked the motorcade of All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship candidate in Taraba, Alhaji Sani Danladi, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. Also in the convoy, which lost no fewer than 10 vehicles burnt in the attack, was Nigeria’s Ambassador to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Alhaji Hassan Ardo. Danladi, who is currently on a campaign tour of the Southern Senatorial District of the state, was on his way to Ibi Local Government Area when some youths ambushed the motorcade at a junction in Wukari. They barricaded the junction, which forced the convoy to slow down, and in the process, attacked the vehicles and the occupants, inflicting injuries on many of them and looting the vehicles. The whereabouts of the governorship candidate and the envoy could not be ascertained after the crisis as some persons on the convoy escaped into Wukari and to the Police Area Command in the town. The Spokesperson for APC in the state, Mr Aaron Artimas, who was at the scene of the incident, accused the opposition of being behind the attack. Artimas also accused the chairman of a local government (name withheld) in the state of masterminding the attack. “We got information that the chairman had allegedly sponsored some youths to burn down APC billboards and facilities in the area. “So it is not surprising that they have taken their frustration to this extent of organizing the youth to attack our convoy and attempt to assassinate the ambassador and our governorship candidate,” he said. He also confirmed that no fewer than 10 vehicles in the convoy were looted and burnt while several others were vandalised. Efforts to get the Divisional Police Officer in Wukari as well as the Police Spokesman in Jalingo did not yield positive results as calls to their phones were not picked or returned. NAN reports that the incident has created tension in the area. (NAN)
