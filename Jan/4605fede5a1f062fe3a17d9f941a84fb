By Doris Esa Abuja –   The Nigerian Air Force says the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has destroyed some terrorists’ gun trucks in air strikes conducted at Auno in Borno. NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. Daramola said the operation was conducted on Monday. “The attacks were executed yesterday, Jan.7, whilst providing close air support for ground troops who were responding to an attack on their location. “The ATF scrambled a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet and a Mi-35M Helicopter Gunship supported by an Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft to locate and engage the group of terrorists’ gun trucks. “Overhead the target area, the ground troops were seen engaging the terrorists who were in a convoy of gun trucks in a fierce gun battle. “After deconfliction, the Alpha Jet and Mi-35M took turns in engaging the terrorists causing them to beat an immediate retreat,’’ he said. The spokesman said in the process, three gun trucks were hit and destroyed while several of their fighters were neutralised. “ The ball of fire from exploding munitions in one of the gun trucks was visibly seen. “Some of the survivors, who were seen attempting to flee the location, were taken out in follow-on attacks,’’ he said.
