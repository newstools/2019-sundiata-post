By Nicholas Dechi Naka (Benue) – Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue on Saturday bagged a Chieftaincy title of the ”Ageva-U-Tyoshin” meaning the protector, barrier and the hedge of the Tyoshin people. The title was bestowed on Ortom by the Tyoshin Traditional Council, Gwer West Local Govrrnment. Mr Daniel Abomtse, the traditional chief of the area, charged the governor to continue to be the defender of the Benue Valley.

He told the governor that the chieftaincy title given to him by the Tyoshin traditional council for standing by his people was a clear assurance of victory in the forthcoming governorship election. Responding, Ortom expressed happiness for the honour done him by the Tyoshin traditional council, and pledged not to disappoint them. He said that the award would spur him to do more for the state and the traditional institution in the state.
