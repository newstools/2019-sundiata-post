In the United States, President Trump is wiling to shut down the government and imperil the paychecks of almost a million workers and the livelihoods of millions of others who depend on federal food or housing assistance in order to prove to his unforgiving supporters that he intends to fulfill his campaign promise of building a wall on the Southern border. Heâ€™s scared of disappointing his supporters, who are quick to remind him of what he said during his campaign. In Nigeria, Buhari disowned the myriad promises he glibly made during his campaign for the presidency in 2014/15 as soon as he won and his supporters, rather than hold him accountable to the promises, promptly forgave him. Go figure. Source: Facebook
