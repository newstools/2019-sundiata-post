Moscow –   Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday agreed to strengthen coordination on Syrian issues through military and diplomatic channels. The Kremlin said the two leaders had a phone conversation on Friday. During the conversation initiated by the Israeli side, the leaders discussed the Syrian situation in the context of the U.S. intention to withdraw its troops from Syria. They stressed the necessity of finally defeating terrorism and quickly advancing a political settlement in Syria. Putin and Netanyahu also exchanged views on some other hot issues and agreed to maintain contacts at various levels. The Syrian Civil War is an ongoing multi-sided armed conflict in Syria fought between the Ba’athist Syrian Arab Republic led by President Bashar al-Assad. This is in alignment with domestic and foreign allies, and various domestic and foreign forces opposing both the government and each other in varying combinations. (Xinhua/NAN)
