By Martha Agas Jos,   –      Prof Mathew Sule, the Executive Chairman of the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Plateau has decried the poor attendance of pupils as schools resume in the State. Sule said in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Jos, that he monitored the resumption of more than seven public primary schools and recorded poor attendance. The chairman said the record was one of the poorest the board had recorded since his assumption of office. “I must say that am not happy with the attendance of the pupils because it would affect the school syllabus which is time bound. “When pupils resume on time, the academic calendar will not be affected but now they have missed out on the scheduled activities for the day. “All head teachers in schools are supposed to conduct pre-resumption meetings with officials of Parents Teachers Association (PTA) to encourage them to allow their children resume and commence academic activities,” he said. The SUBEB boss also blamed the teachers for relenting in sensitising parents on the need to allow their children resume schools immediately. “Teachers are the link to parents, they are required to have good interpersonal communication with them to ensure they take the education of their children serious,” he said.
