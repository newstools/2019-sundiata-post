By Bosede Olufunmi Kano, – The Permanent Secretary, Kano state Servicom Directorate, Alhaji Abdullahi Musa said the organisation would synergise with the state the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) to enhance service delivery, by the scheme, in the state. Musa said this in a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer
(PRO) of the Directorate, Alhaji Sunusi Abdullahi in Kano on Monday. The PRO quoted the Servicom boss as having said this when he (Musa)
visited the State Coordinator of the  National Youth Service Corps
(NYSC), Alhaji Ladan Baba in Kano. The permanent secretary, who noted the shortfall in teachers in core
subjects in Government Secondary Schools in the state, stressed the need
for synergy between the two organisations to address the problems. Musa, however, urged the state  Coordinator to pay much attention to
posting Corps members to conventional schools to teach English language
and Mathematics, especially in the rural areas. Receiving the permanent secretary, the NYSC boss acknowledged that
the scheme was facing some challenges in the course of its statutory
responsibility to the people of the state. The state coordinator of the scheme identified non availability of
NYSC lodges in most of the local government areas for Corps members and 
Corps members not receiving their monthly allowances, regularly, at
their respective areas of primary assignment as some of the challenges. According to him, such development has discouraged the NYSC members
in such areas from performing their legitimate services effectively. He, therefore, appealed to the Directorate to intervene to ensure provision of immediate solutions to the problems.
