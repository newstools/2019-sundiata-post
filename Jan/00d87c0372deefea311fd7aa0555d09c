ABUJA (Sundiata Post) Picture below shows our own Alex Iwobi when he first signed for the Arsenal Academy in 2003 at the age of SEVEN! Today, he is a regular with the first team. How I wish we have this type of set-up in Nigeria where our kids can develop and such development will be monitored so they could mature into successful athletes and sportsmen and women. But the first ingredient is HONESTY; both on part of the authorities and parents of these kids. Iwobi was born on May 3rd, 1996. In other words, his age was NOT DOCTORED nor FALSIFIED. Willie Bazuaye, late Nigerian coach, showed uncommon honesty when his son, Baldwin, was to be included in 2000 Sydney Olympics football event squad. He pointedly told the team handlers that his son was born in 1970 and no way he could play for U-23 in year 2000 at the age of 30. Someone nearly squeezed Peter Ogaba (of the Saudi â€™89 fame) into same 2000 Sydney Olympics squad. Source: Facebook
