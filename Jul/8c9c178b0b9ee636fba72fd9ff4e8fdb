Jakarta – The death toll of Sunday’s 7.2-magnitude quake in eastern Indonesia has risen to six, with 51 others injuried, Agus Wibowo, the Spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB) said on Wednesday. The quake struck off Indonesia’s North Maluku province with the epicenter located 62 km northeast of Labuha in the province. It happened at the depth of 10 km, according to the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG). “Five of the casualties were hit by debris and falling blocks of concrete and another was an old person who died during escape,’’ Wibowo told Xinhua via phone. On Monday, BNPB reported that two people were killed by the natural disaster. Wibowo said that nearly 1,000 houses were destroyed and almost 3,000 residents have been taking shelter in evacuation centers. “Most of them stay in mosques, government office buildings and other buildings in several spots, but the disaster agency also sent tents to  them,’’ said Wibowo. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes as it sits on a vulnerable quake impacted zone dubbed the Pacific Ring of Fire.
