By Priscilla Osaje Abuja – The Federation of Tourism Associations of Nigeria (FTAN) says it will review, reorganise and strengthen all associations registered under it to ensure that the interest of genuine stakeholders are protected. The communiqué signed by its Public Relation Officer, Mr Joesef Karim, at the end of its 22nd Annual General Meeting on Thursday in Abuja expressed dissatisfaction that some of the associations were only existing on paper. FTAN said that the review was to seek the interest of real stakeholders that had the interest of the survival of the industry at heart. It said that that state governments were more committed to tourism development than the Federal Government, adding that the federation must find a way to strengthen and make the state chapters more active. “If FTAN have few stakeholders who have resources to deploy, it will be an end to the paucity of funds in association. “The Nigeria Tourism Investors Forum and Exhibition, being the only major annual of FTAN, should be given priority. “Efforts should be made to ensure that the event is sustained and improved upon. When this is done, it will get to the point that government will key into it to make it a national event,” it said. FTAN recommended that Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should create a special fund which could be accessed by states, especially where the national parks and “other low hanging fruits were located” for the purpose of developing them. “In order to address some of the decisions, there is need for FTAN to call for a stakeholders conference where they will be critically x-rayed and find a lasting solution to them,” FTAN said. FTAN held her 22nd Annual General Meeting and Election on July 11 with the theme “Research and Advocacy as tools for Sustainable Tourism Development”
