PLENARY at the House of Representatives turned rowdy on Wednesday. The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamilia, had said he received a letter from opposition members, which he was about to read to the lawmakers. A member of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Kingsley Chinda, however, raise a point of order but the Speaker ruled him out of order. The development turned the session into rowdiness, with several PDP lawmakers protesting against the planned announcement. The sergeants-at-arms moved to protect the mace while Gbajabiamila, in the heat of the controversy, adjourned the plenary. Factions of the PDP caucus in the House have presented parallel principal officers. A faction claims that the letter Gbajabiamila was about to read did not come from the PDP. The Speaker was guarded out of the chamber amid cheers and jeers. Punch
