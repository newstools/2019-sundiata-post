Berlin – Greenpeace activists have ended a two and half-day protest in Germany against Amazon over the U.S. Company’s practice of destroying returned goods. A Police Spokesman in Winsen, south of Hamburg said that the 32 demonstrators left the roof peacefully shortly after midnight on Wednesday. He added that the protesters were expected to face trespassing charges. According to the environmental activist organisation, the demonstrators had remained on the roof for two and a half days. The logistics centre’s operations were not impaired by the protests. The Greenpeace protest coincided with Amazon’s “Prime Day,” a two-day event on Monday and Tuesday during which special offers were available for users of its Prime subscription service. Greenpeace said that around 30 per cent of all Amazon returns did not go back on sale. Amazon said last month that the vast majority of returned products were resold, returned to suppliers or donated to non-profits. “But some cannot be resold or donated because of hygienic or safety reasons. “We wanted to draw attention to Amazon’s climate-damaging destruction of resources,’’ said Greenpeace’s Viola Wohlgemuth.
