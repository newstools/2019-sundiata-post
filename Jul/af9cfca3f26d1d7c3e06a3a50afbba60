One day before the Fourth of July, a true Sister Act occurred for two sisters in New York. The pair gave birth in the same hospital and on the same day, which also happened to be their father’s birthday. Oh, their daughters were also delivered by the same doctor. Shari and Simone Cumberbatch knew their girls would be close in age, but they never thought they’d be hours apart. Both were originally projected to give birth mid-July, however Simone and her doctor planned a C-section for July 3. She selected the date because it’s her father’s birthday. What the family didn’t plan was for her sister Shari to go into labor on the same day. Shari’s unexpected labor actually delayed Simone’s scheduled C-section as the two shared the same doctor. According to Good Morning America, Shari’s daughter, Hailey, was born at 12:57 p.m. and Simone’s daughter, Liberty, was born a few hours later at 5:30 p.m. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ “They’re like twins… they’ll be close,” Shari said in an interview with CBS New York. The babies’ grandfather received two gifts to celebrate his 70th birthday. “I always used to say ‘what if, what if it happened,’ not knowing it would actually happen,” the newborns’ granddad, Elmo Cumberbatch, told CBS New York. It’s probably safe to assume all future birthday parties will be planned out well in advance and will be held on the same day. Source
