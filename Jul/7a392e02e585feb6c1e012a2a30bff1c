By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila is set to visit Zamfara State tomorrow (Monday) as part of his efforts to assess security challenges in some states across the country. A statement from his special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, said during the visit, the Speaker is expected to travel to some specific local government areas in the state that are most affected by activities of bandits and kidnappers. The statement further reads:  “the speaker, who will be in company of some members of the house, will also meet specific individuals such as government officials, including the state governor, community and religious leaders. “The speaker’s visit would afford him the opportunity to see the situation on ground, return to the House and together with members make necessary recommendations to the Executive arm of government. It is expected that the executive arm will leverage on the assessment of the House on the security situations in the affected states and take further action.” The statement further recalled that after the emergence of Gbajabiamila as speaker, he had promised to visit the states that have been facing security challenges. “This is in line with the Speaker’s campaign slogan themed ‘Nation Building: A Joint Task.
