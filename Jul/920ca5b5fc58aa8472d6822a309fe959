By Ibukun Emiola Ibadan – Dr Nureni Adeniran, Executive Chairman, Oyo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), says the administration of Gov. Seyi Makinde is not owing primary school teachers salaries. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Adeniran made this known on Tuesday while inspecting on-going Federal Government intervention projects in Ibadan metropolis. He said the administration was committed to boosting the education sector, especially at the foundation level. “We have inspected some of the projects that are co-founded by UBEC and SUBEB- that of the federal and the state governments which include classrooms, furniture, toilet facility, borehole and we have seen the level of completion in the 14 schools visited in Ibadan. “At Olopomewa where the Early Childhood Development Centre is being piloted, we have directed the head mistress to ensure compliance by using the place while at Jericho Junior High School, the six classrooms are in use although the toilet is yet to be completed,” he said. Adeniran noted that the contractor had been ordered to finish in record time so that students could use the facility. “We want to be more proactive about our foundation in education because these children are our future. “If the foundation is shaky, the future will be bleak; we don’t want the future of Nigeria and that of Oyo State to be bleak. “We want a vibrant future and therefore our education must be solid in terms of structure, facilities, instructional materials and conducive environment. ” These will make the work of the teachers easy,” he said. The SUBEB boss further said that the state government had made provision for the 2018 counterpart fund as part of its commitment to accessing the Federal Government’s intervention fund through the Universal Basic Education Board.
