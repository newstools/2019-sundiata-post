Accra, July 18, 2019 (Xinhua/NAN) Ghanaian authorities said on Thursday that they had taken steps toward implementing a vital bilateral health cooperation project with China. Under the bilateral health pact reached in Sept. 2018, China and Ghana will embark on efforts to improve maternal and child health services in Ghana. The Ministry of Health, has however, inaugurated a 25-member ministerial steering committee to see to the implementation of the program. Deputy Minister for health Alexander Abban said the health of mothers and children was one of the measures of the health of a nation while inaugurating the committee. “If the woman, who is the main vessel for procreation is not healthy, we are not going to have a healthy population,’’ Abban said. He thanked the government of China for agreeing to partner Ghana on this critical aspect of health delivery. The formation of the committee was one of the steps being taken to actualise agreements Ghana had reached with China during the visit of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to China in September.
