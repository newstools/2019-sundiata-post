INEC chairman Mahmood Yakubu was reported to have said that INEC is the most improved public service in Nigeria! Hahaha! This man isn’t just incompetent and shameless; he is also delusional. INEC is far and away Nigeria’s least improved and most brazenly fraudulent public service. Here is an organization that even EU observers said had degenerated precipitously from its 2015 standards, an electoral body that can’t produce the raw data of the election it conducted more than four months after the fact even when a court has instructed it to do so, an organization that budgeted more than a billion naira for a “central server” and can’t even tell a straight, coherent lie about this server. Mahmood Yakubu’s INEC is straight-up Nigeria’s most legal criminal organization. Source: Facebook
