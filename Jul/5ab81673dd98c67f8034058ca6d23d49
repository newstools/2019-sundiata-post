By Deborah Akpede Ikeja – An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court on Friday ordered the remand of a 39-year-old driver, Friday Paul, accused of sexual assault on a seven-year-old girl, in prison. The Magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanm, ordered that the defendant should be remanded in Kirikiri prisons pending the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Lagos State. She directed that the case file should, therefore, be sent to the DPP, and adjourned the case until Aug 12. Paul, who resides at Ebutte-Meta area of Lagos, is being tried for defilement. His plea on the charge was not taken by the court. Earlier, the Prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde, had told the court that the defendant committed the offence on May 17 at his residence. Ayorinde said that the defendant assaulted the girl by inserting his finger into her private part. “The defendant called the girl into his room, removed her clothes, and dipped his finger into her private part. “Her mother later noticed blood stains on her daughter’s clothes and interrogated her, and the girl told her what the defendant had done to her. “She reported the case to the police and the defendant was arrested,” he said. He said that the offence violated Section 261 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the section prescribes life imprisonment for offenders. (NAN)
