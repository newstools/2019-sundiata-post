By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ The ministerial nominee from Oyo State, Sunday Dare, has said that tackling security is a collective effort. He disclosed this at the floor of the senate on Thursday when Senators were taking turns to ask him questions. Ovie Omo-Agege, deputy senate president, asked him if the sanction in the NCC act is enough to curb non-registration of SIM cards by telecommunications operators. Responding to the questions, Dare said that tackling kidnapping is a collective effort. He said the Nigerian communications Commission (NCC ) is working with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to ensure that proper database is kept to curb crime.
