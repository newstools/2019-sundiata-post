Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Senator Ali Ndume (APC-Borno) has urged all Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Gwazo taking refuge in Maiduguri, to return home, assuring them of their safety. Ndume made the call on Monday while addressing the IDPs in Bakassi and Gubio camps in Maiduguri. The lawmaker, who was intermittently wiping tears with handkerchief, expressed disappointment that the IDPs from Gwoza had yet to be resettled even when normalcy had returned to the town. He said that insurgency had reduced many people in Gwoza to almost beggars and they had to wait to be given handouts in the camp before they could feed. “The Palestinian IDPs camp has been existing for 60 years; in Kenya, it existed for about 30 years. “So, insecurity cannot be completely eliminated. We must therefore defy fears, summon courage and be resilient in order to achieve permanent solution to our problems
