•Mother of the child, Mrs Mary Chukwuebuka, reunited with her child, Gift Chukwuebuka By Masara Kim JOS – Thirty-two-year-old Mrs. Leritshimwa Diyal who ‘stole’ a baby in Jos, the capital of Plateau State last month may have performed poorly in her medical studies while worrying over her childlessness. See https://sundiatapost.com/2019/06/12/commotion-as-3-day-old-baby-gets-stolen-from-hospital-in-plateau/ An official of the College of Health Technology Zawang where she schooled told MKNews that Diyal ought to have graduated last year but failed several courses. “Her mates graduated last year but she has carryovers, too many for her to be considered graduated,” said the Official who prefers anonymity. The ranking non-academic officer of the college believes her underperformance was due to depression.

She is depressed and needs serious help,” said the Official. Mrs. Diyal was arrested on allegations of child theft which she has owned up to. She however told journalists while being paraded in Jos by Police that she wished she was dead.

Observers are however of the view that the suspect being a victim of social stigmatization should be considered for trauma counselling not punishment. Others recommend lighter punishment for her having owned up to the crime and shown remorse.
