Binghamton basketball player Calistus Anyichie died at 19 by drowning at Buttermilk Falls State Park on Sunday. “There is no blueprint for how to deal with such a painful loss,” Binghamton coach Tommy Dempsey said in a statement. “We all love Calistus so much. He was a special young man. We are all devastated.” According to the Ithaca Journal, Anyichie’s body was found at the base of a 15-foot gorge in the park, which is located just southwest of Ithaca. The Nigerian national played in 32 games as a freshman for the Bearcats, averaging 1.9 points and 2.1 rebounds. Anyichie was a scholar-athlete at St. Mary’s of the Assumption High School in Short Hills, NJ. “A talented young person has been tragically taken from us,” Binghamton president Harvey Stenger said in a statement. “This is a heartbreaking loss for our community. We will do all that we can to be there for his family, for the team and everyone who knew Calistus.” Source
