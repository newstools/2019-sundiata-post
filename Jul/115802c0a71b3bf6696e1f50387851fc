N-Power, the Federal Government’s youth empowerment scheme, has disclosed when its N-Creative programme would start. It declared that the N-Power Creative would start on Friday. In a tweet on Thursday, the scheme directed prospective beneficiaries to check their emails for further information. “Hey Peeps. “N-Power Creative starts this Friday. If you are a beneficiary, be sure to check your email,” the tweet read. The N-Creative programme was announced in October 2018. The programme will train and develop 5,000 young creative talents. The strategy is to put Nigeria’s creative industry on the global radar as exporters of world-class services and content. The training, which would last three months, is made up of 1-month in-class and a 2-month hands-on group project, across selected Nigerian cities. The participants will be trained and certified in one of the following courses: Animation, Graphic Design, Post-production and Script Writing. Source
