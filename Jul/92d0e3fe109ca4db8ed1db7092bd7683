The Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) has denied culpability in the murder of the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of operations in the FCT, Usman Musa. The police commissioner and a 23-year-old Channels Television reporter were some of those who lost their lives on Monday after the police and members of the IMN clashed in Abuja. IMN spokesman, Ibrahim Musa, told Vanguard on Tuesday that its members do not carry weapons and so could not have been responsible for the DCP’s death. He accused the police of being ‘armed to the teeth’ and bent on ‘stopping the movement of the protesters’. “Also shot were a journalist with the Channels TV and their colleague, and Deputy Commissioner of Police, whom photographs showed was struck from the back of his head with the bullet exit in front, an indication that he was a victim of friendly fire. “As if to hide this fact, the late policeman was hurriedly buried without any form of postmortem examination, which would have revealed the source of the bullet,” he said.
