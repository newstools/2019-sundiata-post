Outspoken comedian, Ushbebe has revealed on stage that two Big Brother Naija housemates, Mercy and Tasha are known “old prostitutes”. He made this known while performing at Akpororo’s comedy show which took place yesterday in Lagos. While performing at the show, the comedian said it is the reason Tasha has no respect for anyone in the house. He also referred to Mercy as a very popular “opo” (prostitute) in Lagos. This may not come as a great shock to many who follow Tacha as she is notorious on Instagram for showing off videos in which she is scantily dressed dancing seductively and shaking her body parts.
