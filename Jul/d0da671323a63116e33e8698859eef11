A Federal High Court in Abuja recently ordered an interim forfeiture of properties belonging to the lawmaker representing Delta North senatorial district, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi. Justice Taiwo O. Taiwo in the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1127/18 ordered an interim forfeiture of 14 properties and 22 bank accounts linked to the senator to the Federal Government of Nigeria. The case filed by the Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property on behalf of the Federal Government, also placed a post-no-debit order on 22 bank accounts linked to Nwaoboshi. In his political career, Nwaoboshi served as a commissioner in Delta State, from 2000 to 2006. He served also as a senator from 2015 to 2019. In the 2019 election, Nwaoboshi contested and won but the primary election that produced him was voided by an Abuja court. Justice A. R Mohammed ruled that from all available evidence before the court, Ned Nwoko convincingly won the Delta North PDP senatorial primary election held on 2nd, October 2018. The judge had nullified the election and declared Ned Nwoko winner of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Delta North senatorial primary.
