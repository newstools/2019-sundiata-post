The Director General of National Orientation Agency, Dr Garba Abari has commended Qatar Charity for building and donating an all-encompassing facility for less privileged persons in Dakwa, Niger State. In furtherance of the mandate of the Agency to partner institutions and groups to promote opportunity for less privileged persons in our society, the Agency in partnership with the Qatar Charity unveiled the facility on Tuesday, alongside the governor of Niger state. Abubakar Sani Bello. According to Abari, the facility which includes a school, orphanage, clinic, playground, staff quarters and mosque will foster peace, progress and social development for the beneficiaries. ‘’I commend the Qatari state for such a very wonderful intervention in the area of social support. You can see this program is specifically for orphans. It has a school, a hospital, playground, place of worship. So on a larger scale, the community of Dakwa will benefit from the school system because it is an environment that will guarantee very good education. For a charity organisation to go this far, it calls for commendation and encouragement. And we as citizens’ engagement agency call on the community to make best use of this facility and ensure that it is very well managed and protected,’’ he said. Also speaking about the kind gesture was the Governor of Niger state, Abubakar Sani Bello. He said: ‘’This is a very good initiative. This facility contains a school, hospital, mosque and a shopping complex, built by the Qatar charity and handed over today to the foundation, which will ensure maintenance and sustainability of this facility. ‘’Overall, I am pleased with what I have seen here today. I hope we will see more of this in the future. Government cannot do it alone, and we call for more of this. The facility addresses, education, health, commercial and religious needs.’’
