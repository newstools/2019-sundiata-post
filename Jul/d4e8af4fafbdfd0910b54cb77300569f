Reacting, Saunders branded Zidane’s comment as disgraceful, adding that the former Tottenham Hotspur star does not deserve that from Real Madrid coach. Zinedine Zidane A former Liverpool striker, Dean Saunders has criticised Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, for saying that it would be best for everyone if forward Gareth Bale leaves the Los Blancos soon. It was reported that Zidane over the weekend, told reporters after his side’s 3-1 defeat to Bayern Munich in a pre-season friendly encounter that it would be best for everyone if Bale leaves Real Madrid soon. Zidane said: “Bale did not play because he is very close to leaving.“We hope he leaves soon, it would be best for everyone. We are working on his transfer to a new team.“I have nothing personal against him, but there comes a time where things are done because they must be done, I have to make decisions, we have to change. “The exit is the coach’s decision, and also of the player, who knows the situation.“The situation will change, I do not know if in 24 or 48 hours, but it will, and it’s a good thing for everyone.” Reacting, Saunders branded Zidane’s comment as “disgraceful”, adding that the former Tottenham Hotspur star does not deserve that from Real Madrid coach. The former Wales international told talkSPORT: “I think they’re disgraceful quotes about a player who has won the Champions League four times.“I know Gareth, I have worked with him. He’s one of the nicest lads you’ll meet.“He’s a nice lad and I don’t think he deserved that. Zidane is trying to get him out of the club but it surprised me.” Source
