Samuel Chukwueze has been considered to start against South Africa in tonight’s AFCON quarterfinal ahead of Moses Simon, while Ola Aina will also give way to Jamiu Collins. Chukwueze was a 60th minute sub for Moses Simon in the Round of 16 win over Cameroon and he made such an impact in the game that the Eagles advance to this quarterfinal clash. Ola Aina has played at left back with distinction in place of the injured Jamilu Collins since the AFCON kicked off, but he will now drop to the bench for the Germany-based Collins against Bafana Bafana on Wednesday. Otherwise, Gernot Rohr has maintained the core of the team who toppled defending champions Cameroon at the weekend in Alexandria. Arsenal forward Alex Iwobi will play in central midfield behind top striker Odion Ighalo in a 4-2-3-1 formation that Rohr has long employed with this team. Super Eagles starting XI vs South Africa: 4-2-3-1- Daniel Akpeyi – Jamilu Collins, William Ekong, Kenneth Omeruo, Chidozie Awaziem – Wilfred Ndidi, Oghenekaro Etebo – Alex Iwobi, Samuel Chukwueze, Ahmed Musa – Odion Ighalo
