Nigerian singer, Omawunmi whose newly released album ‘In Her Feelings’ is still blazing rocks a see-through outfit in photoshoot. Sharing photos she wrote: “I remember when I started out in the industry… My dresses were so short, my mum would say I use handkerchiefs to sew my dresses! Over time, especially when I became a mom and a wife, I became conservative and ‘covered’ with my sense of style and music.
Now you might ask…’what is she doing?’ My answer is my current look is intentional in connection to my current sound. ‘will it be permanent?’ – I don’t think soðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£…who knows? I’m just exploring my many sides and loving myself in the process….I’m just Omawonder.” See more photos below: Source
