By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu – Dr Eddie Mbadiwe, a popular football fan in Enugu, has urged the Super Eagles to redouble their efforts in order to defeat their age-long rivals, the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Super Eagles will be locking horns with the Lions on Saturday in the round of 16 of the ongoing 32nd African Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt. Mbadiwe, a former member of the House of Representatives on the platform of APGA, told NAN on Thursday in Enugu that the national team needed to work hard to beat the Cameroonians. “They need to wake up from their slumber of their last match with Madagascar and start working hard from all departments of the team. “They should be aware that they are confronting the hard-fighting Cameroonians,’’ he said. Emmanuel Okala, a former Green Eagles Goalkeeper, told NAN that Nigerians were wishing the Super Eagles well in their next match, but that “they must work hard and be coordinated’’. Okala, a member of the 1980 African Cup of Nations Cup winning squad, said: “Millions of Nigerians, including myself, are praying for their success and we will continue to back them even to the last minute of the match. “We know that the Cameroonians are a hard nut to crack but they can be defeated anyway.’’ Ifeanyi Okonkwo, an ardent supporter of Rangers International FC, Enugu, urged the Super Eagles to up their game. Okonkwo said that the national senior team must redeem their image from the defeat by low-rated Madagascar by defeating the Cameroonians. “We want the Super Eagles to come back in the tournament by winning Cameroon with good number of goals,’’ Okonkwo said.
