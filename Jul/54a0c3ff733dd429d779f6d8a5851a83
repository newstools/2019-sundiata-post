Leader of the Indigenous people of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has announced the establishment of BIAFRA Aid Foundation in the United States of America. In a statement on Monday by the group’s media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, Kanu said the organisation was for the fast-tracking of the restoration of Biafra. He said a grassroots fundraising initiative was agreed as part of the process. The statement partly reads: “During my recently concluded tour of the United States, I promised to set up a US based charitable organisation to enable us fast-track the restoration of Biafra and stem the tide of Fulani terror invasion of our land. “I am pleased to announce the establishment of BIAFRA Aid Foundation in the United States of America which I made public during last night’s special broadcast. “The official IPOB backed Biafra Aid Foundation bank account number is now available to enable Biafrans domiciled in the USA and lovers of freedom from all over the world to contribute just $1 charitable donation every blessed month until Biafra sovereignty is fully restored and Fulani terrorism completely eradicated from all territories of the south.” The Nation
