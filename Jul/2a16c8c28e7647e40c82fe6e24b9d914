Following the suspension of controversial Ruga Settlements by the federal government today, a lot of Nigerians are reacting to the decision. While some are jubilant, others remain skeptical. It has been alluded that about N12bn had already been allotted for the project. Some reactions are concerned about the state of that fund as many can still not say what happened to the funds dedicated for setting up a national carrier that never got off to any start. See reactions below: Nigerians won all the advocacies this week. Biodun Fatoyinbo â€“ Stepped DownSenator Abbo- Under investigationBuhari Ruga- Suspended This is how office of the citizen works. If we keep quite, they will do nothing. Congratulations everyone Biodun Fatoyinbo has stepped down.RUGA has been suspended.The Islamic Cleric that raped a 16year old in Osun State has been arrested.Disgraceful Senator Elisha Abbo is now under police investigation by the IG.Thank you to everyone who speaks up for justice on social media! Congrats Nigerians. RUGA is DEAD! When we said #Ruga was a scam, the usual ppl went off at usual tangents of abuse. The full story is massive scandalhttps://t.co/CrKMmeupNP We do not want you to suspend RUGA, we want you to CANCEL it! Suspension means you are postponing the evil day, cancel means it is NEVER coming back. If you want peace in this country RUGA must be CANCELLED and you must also CANCEL your Fulanisation and Islamisation policy. Questions must be asked about those who tried to smuggle this RUGA initiative and link it with the National Livestock Transformation plan. I suspect if Osinbajo's Office did not disassociate itself from this thing, they might have used his name to implement it. https://t.co/DhlAM2g6ZH Thanks to all patriotic Nigerians who voices out against RUGA. RUGA is now dead!Meanwhile, RUGA died with our N21billion!
