By Enoch Shaks,Jos. Members of the third Republic of the Plateau State House of Assembly from January 1992 to November 1993 that were toppled by the military junta via annulment of the 1993 Presidential Elections adjudged as one of the freest,non religious, and non ethnic have appealed to the Executive Governor of Plateau State,Rt Hon Bar Dr Simon Bako Lalong to as a matter of urgency come to their aid and rescue them from death by putting in motion, the process of the payment of their Severance Allowance and other entitlements which they did not benefit as a result of the sudden termination of their tenure. The call was made in a letter signed by Hon Lohlum Samuel Vondip, for and on behalf of the Forum of the Third Republic Members of the Plateau State House of Assembly (January 1992-November 1993) written to the Executive Governor of Plateau State,Rt Hon Bar Dr Simon Bako Lalong for intervention dated 12th November,2015 through the Secretary to the State Government of Plateau State. The letter hinted that the Assembly then was made up of Forty Six (46) members including Nasarawa State while Plateau State had Twenty Six (26) members, Nasarawa State had Twenty (20) members. The Forum of the Third Republic Members of the Plateau State House of Assembly is appealing to the Plateau State Government to quickly intervene as eight out of the twenty six members are dead, though their families are entitled to the allowances,they will greatly benefit from the Governorâ€™s benevolence. The Forum of the Third Republic Members of the Plateau State House of Assembly (January 1992-November1993) heartily congratulates the Governor on his well deserved victory at the polls and prays to God Almighty to grant him the wisdom of King Solomon to pilot the affairs of Plateau State to the admiration of the good people of Plateau State and beyond.
