Wizkid third babymama, Jada P has called out the singer and accused him of Domestic Violence in their relationship. Jada has been defending Wizkid for many years from allegations from his other baby mamas, but she had declared that she is tired of defending him. In a post she shared on her Instagram story, Jada says Wizkid beats her a lot, and sometimes leaves her with bruises on her body. “From today I and Ayo no longer work together. I’ve been in an abusive relationship with him for years, covering up for him time and time again. I am tired.” “Wiz continuously puts his hands on me, leaves me with bruises that I cover up from he world including my friends and family. It often feels like we are at war in the same house” “I have done all I can to keep this all together but from today I let go. You can support someone as much as you can but at some point you have to value yourself.” “I can’t raise my son in this kind of unhealthy environment”. she wrote on the gram. Wizkid who turned 29 yesterday, is yet to respond.
