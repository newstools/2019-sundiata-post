By Patricia Amogu Abuja – R. Kelly’s crisis manager Darrell Johnson has said that he can never leave his daughter with a pedophile while announcing step down from his position in the singer’s camp. “I step down as crisis manager for personal reasons. “Mr Kelly is in good hands with Mr Green-berg,” he told CBS News, referring to the singer’s lawyer Steve Green-berg. While Johnson says unspecified personal reasons are behind his exit, he attempted to defend Kelly against the singer’s recent charges while also seemingly asserting that he wouldn’t risk leaving his own daughter alone with him. “I would not leave my daughter with anyone that’s accused of being a pedophile. “I would not,” he told King when asked if he would hypothetically allow his own 20-year-old daughter near the singer, whom Johnson describes as a “normal person” who will soon “have his day in court,” he said. When King pushed back, pointing out the contradiction in his statement, Johnson reiterated, “I wouldn’t leave my daughter with anyone — I’m going to say it again — that’s accused of being a pedophile.” R. Kelly has repeatedly denied all of the sexual-abuse and sexual-misconduct allegations against him. (NAN)
