New Delhi – The Indian government has appointed new governors for six states, an official communication from the office of the President of India said on Saturday. While Anandiben Patel has been appointed as the new governor of Uttar Pradesh, Jagdeep Dhankhar will be the new governor of West Bengal, Ramesh Bais as governor of Tripura, Lal Ji Tandon of Madhya Pradesh, Phagu Chauhan of Bihar, and R.N. Ravi of Nagaland. In Indian polity, governors are appointed by the president of India on the advice of the country’s prime minister. The person holding the post assumes significance even as he/she acts as a link between the central government and the state government headed by a Chief Minister. A governor is always seen as a central government’s representative, though he/she doesn’t participate in the law-making process. Legislations passed by a state’s legislature becomes a law only after the governor’s signature. (Xinhua/NAN)
