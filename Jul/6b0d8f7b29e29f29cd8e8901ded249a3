Activist and Former President of NANS, Abdul Mahmud has revealed on Twitter that the controversial Ruga Settlement has opened up a can of worms in Aso Rock as Governors have begun agitation against it, prompting President Buhari to claim ignorance, in spite of the fact that several statements have been made regarding the matter from the presidency. See Mahmudâ€™s revealing thread below: When they tell you that you are screaming for nothing, scream louder because your voice is your power and your scream is reaching them. Yesterday was the day in the Rock of Power. Angry governors finally seized the bull by horns and balls when your voice reached them Meanwhile, N12b of the unappropriated N23b (likely taken from the Ecological Fund) has been spent by the Rugga Cabal- Kyari, Gumel, Bagudu, SGF- and that's the mountaintop that Asa's fire is burning. They are running. Issa running. PMB like Pilate don wash im hand komot The governors are insisting on the NLTP. If you don't scream, Rugga will be smuggled into the VP's NLTP and sold to Nigerians. Scream: the land component of even the VP's programme must be disclosed. Pile the pressure; tweet at the VPNo Rugga through the backdoor!
