There is a brewing controversy over a new order from the management of National Human Rights Commission compelling all members of staff to sign and subscribe to an oath of secrecy. Prof Chidi Odinkalu writes in detail about the issue and how the failure of the president to appoint a new governing council. See his thread below: #Nigeria's National Human Rights Commission, @NHRCTweets, a public body bound by the Freedom of Information Act (FoIA), has in the past week ordered all its staff to sign & subscribe to forms of "Oath of Secrecy" â€“ very much like a #SecretCult pic.twitter.com/6Nsi6OygDn Contrary to the claims of the leadership of @NhrcTweets, however, the Standing Orders & Rules of Procedure, #STORP, of the Commission don't in any way support #SecrecyOaths. Quite clearly, the leadership have chosen to mis-represent the relevant rules of the #STORP pic.twitter.com/MbyFrStnQt The leadership of @NhrcTweets commits 2 errors. 1st, they deliberately equate "secrecy" with confidentiality. The former has no place in the Commission; the latter applies to casework. 2nd, they make this applicable to all staff not those working on caseshttps://t.co/RpsHN3MUTE In any case, @NhrcTweets is an institution that shd be at the #CuttingEdge of promoting access to information & transparency in government. Surely, it shd be the last institution to emulate the oathing practice of #SecretCults & outlaw societies. It's ironic that it's the @NhrcTweets Staff Union arguing for respect for the #FOIA while the Management subverts the Act, claiming that #FoIA has nothing to do with their #SecrecyOath. This is the awful reality of today's #Nigeria, where Human Rights Commission is #SecretCult.
