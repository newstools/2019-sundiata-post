Usman Umar, deputy commissioner of police in charge of operations in the federal capital territory (FCT), has been killed. Umar was reportedly killed during a protest by members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), also known as the Shiites, in Abuja on Monday. He was said to have been shot while trying to pacify the protesting Shiâ€™ite members. He later died at an undisclosed hospital. Umar, until his appointment as the DCP, operations, was the principal staff officer (PSO), to Ibrahim Idris, former inspector-general of police (IGP). Members of IMN had taken to the streets of Abuja to demand the release of Ibrahim Zakzaky, their leader, who has been in detention since 2015. The protest, which began from NITEL junction at Wuse zone 2, was disrupted by armed policemen who cordoned off the road leading to the national assembly and three arms zone. Bullets were fired at the protesters as they advanced towards the Eagle Square. The situation sparked tension as workers fled while motorists abandoned their vehicles on the road. The Cable
