Perennial flooding and bad roads (pot holes, gullies, failing bridges) during raining season are indications that Lagos is one big FRAUD. You don’t want to know the robbery that goes on in the name of governance. The looting of public funds in the name of governance can kill. Serving commissioners, political appointees, Tinubu foot soldiers, Assembly men, top civil servants are all STINKINGLY RICH. Their current alibi is to blame Ambode as if he was governor since 1999. Since money does NOT fall from the skies, if you can’t see the CONNECTION between FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE and the WEALTH of these politically privileged individuals, then go and retrieve your brain from where you exchanged it for ‘panda’ (aluminium spoon).
