By Polycarp Auta Jos – The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) will clamp down on illegal operators of tricycles and motorcycle operators, nationwide. Mr Andrew Bala, the Public Education Officer of the Plateau Command of the corps, disclosed this in a statement on Friday in Jos. Bala said that the command was given Aug. 1 to begin its special patrol against unregistered tricycle and motorcycle operators within Jos and Bukuru metropolis. “So, from Aug. 1, we shall commence a special patrol against unlicensed motorcycle and Tricycle operators to ensure safety of lives and property in the state. “These categories of road users are by this notice advised to get their motorcycles and tricycles properly registered to avoid arrest,” he said. He said the clamp down became imperative because the illegal operation of tricycles also known as “Keke Napep” and motorcycles, popularly known as ‘Okada “, was posing serious security threat in the state. Bala also said that the huge number of unqualified operators of trycles and motorcycles who plied major streets and highways had increased the rate of road accidents and crimes in the state. “It has come to our notice that the rate of road crashes and crimes such as armed robbery and Kidnapping carried out with the use of unregistered motorcycles and tricycles is alarming. “It has become very imperative for us to address this issue before it becomes a menace that will throw the state into serious confusion. He advised members of the public to desist from patronising motorcycles and tricycles without number plates, adding that such operators constituted serious security threat. The official called on the residents of the state to support FRSC in its efforts to ensure a safe motoring environment for all.
