By Adekunle Williams Ikeja – The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) has begun installation of prefabricated pilot joint briefing offices nationwide to digitalise the nation’s Aeronautical Information Service (AIS). The NAMA General Manager, Public Affairs, Mr Khalid Emele, confirmed the development in a statement on Sunday in Lagos. Emele said the installation team had completed work at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos. He said the team had proceeded to another airport and was expected to continue the installation in 21 airports and three aerodromes. According to him, when operational, the prefabricated offices will provide a one-stop shop at the airside where crew members can obtain AIS briefing and meteorological information. “They will be able to make necessary payments at a single point in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organisation Standard and Recommended Practices. “The facility will also accommodate the equipment room for the video satellite network which is simultaneously being installed by the contractor,” he said. He  quoted  the Managing Director of NAMA, Capt. Fola Akinkuotu, as saying that the installation was part of the efforts of the agency to enhance seamless and sustainable communication in the upper airspace. He quoted Akinkuotu as also saying  that the satellite line-up for the VSAT node at NAMA headquarters in Lagos would be completed within the week, while that of Abuja, Port Harcourt and other stations would follow later. He added that NAMA boss said that the installation of 14 new Very Jigh Grequency (VHF) radio sites, which would ride on the new VSAT network, would begin simultaneously with the installation. According to Emele, the NAMA boss expressed gratitude to the Federal Government for intervention that led to the final clearance of the agency’s VSAT equipment at the Apapa Port, Lagos State.
