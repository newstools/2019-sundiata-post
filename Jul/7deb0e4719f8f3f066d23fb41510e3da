Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo, is currently leading the race to become the highest goalscorer at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations. Ighalo netted a brace in Nigeria’s 3-2 win over Cameroon on Saturday, to take his tally to three goals so far. The Shanghai Shenhua frontman had earlier found the back of the net, in a 1-0 win over Burundi during the group stages. He is tied with Senegal’s Sadio Mane, who has also scored three times so far. Ighalo will have a chance to extend his tally, when the Eagles take on South Africa on Wednesday, July 10. Top scorers so far: 3 goals: Ighalo (NGR), Mane (SEN)
