Nairobi – Kenya’s economic growth in 2019 is predicted to hit six per cent in 2019, the central bank governor said on Thursday. Patrick Njoroge told a news conference in Nairobi that the growth would be helped by stronger-than-expected performance in agriculture. “We expect growth to remain strong. We are projecting six per cent as a baseline. It can be stronger,” Njoroge said.
