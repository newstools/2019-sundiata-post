The Prelate of the Methodist church in Nigeria, Eminence Samuel Uche, has given his own opinion on the controversial rape allegation levelled against senior pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Biodun Fatoyinbo, by Busola Dakolo. The prelated shared his opinion on the rape allegation in a recent interview with media personality, Prisca Chiemeka in which he said the allegation might not be true. “Some accusations are foolish. For me, from my way of analysing things, there is no truth in such a thing. You say somebody raped you when you were 26 years or so and after 16 years years you come and report. What is wrong. Maybe you demanded money or you wanted some payment and the person did not give you, then you decide to blackmail the person. Why do you punish somebody for a sin committed 16 years ago. Our lord Jesus Christ says any sinner that believes is forgiven. He said repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand. How do you go and tarnish the image of a man or woman who commited something from years ago. Is it relevant?,” he said. Watch a clip from the interview below: Source
