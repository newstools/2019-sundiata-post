By Masara Kim The Riyom and Barkin Ladi Local Government Areas in Plateau State have been listed as among places where the Federal Government proposed Ruga settlements for Fulani herdsmen will be located in the state. These two local government areas dominated by the Berom ethnic group witnessed the gruesome killing of 200 people by suspected herdsmen in June 2018. The Berom have kicked against the move by government to create Ruga settlement in their community, saying no community should be coerced to accept the government’s proposed housing project for Fulani herders. The Federal Government had said that states would be allowed the liberty to choose whether to accept the “Ruga” project or not. This clarification came after it had proposed to site the project in the two local government areas without consultation. It however allegedly sited the project in the Berom dominated Riyom and Barkin-Ladi Local Government Areas where over 200 people were killed by suspected herdsmen in June 2018 without consultation. “The Berom do not have land to donate for the establishment of RUGA settlement in any parts of Barkin-Ladi, Riyom and Jos South Local Government Areas of the state,” said a statement by Berom Youth Moulders-Association, on Monday. The government should rather reclaim lands violently taken by the herders and return to the local owners, the statement signed by Mr. Dung Gyang, BYM national publicity secretary concluded.
