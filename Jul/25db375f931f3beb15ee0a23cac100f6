Nwabuko Abuja
(Sundiata Post) – Group under the auspices of the APC Justice Forum/Buhari
Support Group (Kogi State) has rejected the adoption of indirect primaries
recommended by the All Progressives Congress’ National Working Committee (NWC)
for the August 16 governorship election in Kogi State. The group which
informed that indirect election is not in the interest of members of the party
in Kogi state reminded that there were no consultations of the stakeholders
before opting for indirect election. It however
called for the constitution of a care-taker Committee that will bring all the
stakeholders in the party to a round table to agree on the workable solution
and majority agreement on the method of primary to adopt. The APC
Justice Forum/Buhari Support Group (Kogi State) made the call on Monday in a
chat with newsmen in Abuja in reaction to what it described as hasty adoption of
indirect primaries in Kogi State against the wishes and aspirations of Kogi
people. According to
the group, “Having assessed the political developments in Kogi State in the
last few days, particularly with recourse to the adoption of indirect primaries
by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress, we
submit here that the position of NWC was not in the interest of the members of
the party in Kogi State. The group
insisted that for the NWC to be seen as neutral and to guarantee a level playing
field for the governorships aspirants of the party numbering up to twenty five
(25), direct primary should be adopted such that looser would know they lost in
a free fair and unbiased contest rather that seeing to have given some
aspirants upper and over and above others even before the commencement of the
contest. “The
political dynamics in Kogi State, where the ruling APC parades a number of
gubernatorial aspirants close to 25; direct form of primary would ensure
democratic participation of all aspirants which at the end, whoever that loses
would have been satisfied with the process that he/she participated”. While citing
examples of states with similar circumstances where direct primaries were
adopted to ensure a smooth primary the group said: “ Direct
primaries have been tested in Osun, Lagos, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and
other states that participated in the gubernatorial elections, especially in
the those states with large number of aspirants and it worked well without legal
conundrum.Indeed , the APC  presidential primary
held in 2018 for president Muhammadu Buhari in Kogi State was through direct
primary, equally the election of ward officers, where delegates were generated
; used direct primary in governorship election with its attendant negative
implications of vote buying, intrigues and above all legal tussle? The group
while warning that any process short of direct primary election for the
emergence of gubernatorial candidate in August would leave the party licking its
wounds later, faulted the members of the so-called stakeholders, who it alleged
were appointees of Governor Yahaya Bello, who were quoted to have held a
meeting of the All Progressives Congress. The APC
Justice Forum/Buhari Support Group (Kogi State) stressed that it is raising
concern because since it has come to the public domain that the APC has adopted
indirect primary, the morale of electorates across the three senatorial
districts in Kogi State has dampened, and the implication is a prelude to
losing the governorship election, come November 16, 2019. It therefore
called on the APC National Working Committee to harken to the voice of electorates
in Kogi State who are looking forward to a direct primary as the only method of
election that would save the party from impending implosion as witnessed in
Rivers and Zamfara State where the party lost out because of action and
inactions of aggrieved members.
