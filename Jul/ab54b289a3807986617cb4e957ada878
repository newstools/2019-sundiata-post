As compensation for missing the ongoing nations cup, Arsenal forward and Gabon international Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has added a customised £240,000 Lamborghini Huracan to his incredible car collection now worth £2.1MILLION. The 30 year old African Footballer of the year showed off his new psychedelic-looking motor, which also has a red soft top, by posting a video on his Twitter. The former Borussia Dortmund star earns a £198,000-a-week salary at Arsenal, meaning it would only take him two weeks to pay for his new Lamborghini.
