Gaza – The Secretary-General of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), Saeb Erekat, said that Palestinians would not accept the resettlement of Palestinian refugees in Arab countries, rejecting U.S. ideas calling for that. Erekat, who spoke at a political symposium in the West Bank city of Jericho earlier on Friday, said that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration team was seriously attempting to neutralise Palestinians and resettling them. Erekat said “we will not allow resettlement or formation of refugee committees for that aim, while holding on to the settlement of their cause in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions.’’ The remarks came against the backdrop of leaked reports that say the United States may be seeking the resettlement of Palestinian refugees in at least five Arab neighbouring countries. Palestinians demand a settlement of the issue of refugees in line with UN resolution 194, which calls for the right of return and/or compensation for Palestinians refugees. (Xinhua/NAN)
