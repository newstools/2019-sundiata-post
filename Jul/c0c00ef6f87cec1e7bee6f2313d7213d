Sequel to Ynaija’s earlier report that social critic, Ifedayo ‘DaddyFreeze’ Olarinde has allegedly been listed by Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo to be granted an interview as part of a series of plans set out with the aim of wresting control of the narrative around the COZA scandal, the #FreeTheSheeple Leader has responded. Although Daddy Freeze did not confirm if he has been contacted or not, the On-Air-Personality as contained in his response to a text message sent to him by YNaija early Monday, noted that his platform was available to all parties in the COZA rape scandal in the ‘spirit of truth and fairness.’ See full response below: “From the very first video I did on this issue, I made it clear that my platform was available to BOTH parties in the spirit of truth and fairness as the scripture teacher that I pride myself to be and brandish with boldness on the bio of all my social media accounts.
(John 7:24, James2:1, James2:9, Deuteronomy 1:17) Also, I personally find the line ‘controlling the narrative’ somewhat mischievous, especially when it is coming from what is supposed to be a world class media house, which in my opinion should moreso concern itself with having an ‘equitable narrative’ as against suggesting that hearing from the other party would mean ‘controlling the narrative’. I do not condone rape or abuse of religious office in any way or form and agree that when an activity seems to raise threats of harm to humans, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically. This notwithstanding, we must judge righteous judgement. (John7:24) In the court of law, both parties would be entitled to a proper defense team and the right to a fair hearing. Since this matter is already being judged before the court of public opinion, I’d like to suggest that those rights be maintained. ~FRZ” Source
