By Deborah Coker Benin â€“ The Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), Edo Command, has warned individuals ellegedly mounting illegal road blocks on the highways to extort money from tanker drivers to desist from the act. The State Commandant of the corps, Mr Makinde Ayinla, gave the warning on Monday in Benin, while reacting to a letter from the zonal office of National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) on the issue. Ayinla said the warning had become imperative, following the complaint by the state chapter of NUPENG on the issue. He said that the union in its letter had notified the command of the nefarious activities of some individuals who mounted illegal road blocks on the highways in the state to extort money from tanker drivers. The state commandant said such conduct was likely to cause breach of public peace. He therefore warned the group to desist from the act or face the wrath of the law.
