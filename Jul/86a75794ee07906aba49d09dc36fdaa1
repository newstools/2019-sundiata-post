The 37-year-old American was sanctioned for an incident which took place during a practice session before the tournament got underway. “The code given is for unsportsmanlike behaviour. The reason is court damage,” a spokeswoman told AFP. Williams is in action twice later Tuesday when she faces fellow American Alison Riske for a place in the semi-finals. She then returns to Centre Court to partner Britain’s Andy Murray in the mixed doubles. Source: Channels Tv
