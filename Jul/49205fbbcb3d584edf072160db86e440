Former Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige, on Thursday, revealed that he left his former party, the Peoples Democratic Party when it wasn’t “doing well.” He said this during his screening as a ministerial nominee at the Senate. Ngige, who was welcomed to the Red Chamber by the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, for the second time saluted the Senators and then moved on to the left side of the aisle. Addressing the upper legislative chamber, Ngige said, “My distinguished brothers on the left side of the aisle, who I left in that my former party when the party was not doing well but are still waxing strong — when the vehicle became rickety, I had to leave. “So, the leader of the minority, and the whip, who is my boss and chairman of the Senate Committee on Power, Steel (Development) and Metallurgy — I was his deputy.” Ngige was asked to take a bow and leave in line with the Senate rules for former legislative members. The Senate on Wednesday started the screening of the 43 ministerial nominees that President Muhammadu Buhari had sent to the National Assembly. Ngige is one of the two ministerial nominees from Anambra State. Punch
