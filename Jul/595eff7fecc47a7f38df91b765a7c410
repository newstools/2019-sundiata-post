Blantyre (Malawi) – About 412 Mozambican families, who crossed borders into Malawi due to the effects of Cyclone Idai in March, received food and non-food items to aid their return back home. The people are from Morrumbara District in Mozambique but crossed the boundary into Malawi’s border district of Nsanje down south where they sought refuge. A total of 2,065 displaced families from Mozambique were in disaster camps in Malawi after fleeing their country. The Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma), a Malawi government arm responsible for disasters, with the UNHCR who have provided the relief items, made the donations in preparation for the survivors’ return to their homes. Dodma relief and rehabilitation officer, Ephod Kachigwada, told local media on Wednesday that the return packages were a necessity because they will help the Mozambicans integrate well with their communities when they return home. “It was necessary that we give them a starter packs as they prepare to return home,’’ he said. Other than aiding the Mozambicans, Dodma and UNHCR have also assisted 7,088 Malawians affected by floods in four districts of Chikwawa, Nsanje, Phalombe and Zomba in the southern region. (Xinhua/NAN)
