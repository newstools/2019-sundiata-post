Siasia’s mother for the second time in four years was abducted on July 15th by gunmen, who fled the community to an unknown place through the River Nun. The gunmen also attacked another apartment in the Odoni community kidnapping 66-year-old Florence Donana and her 17-year-old daughter. A family source, who spoke in confidence, confirmed that the marauders established contact for the first time with Siasia at about 11pm on Wednesday to begin negotiation for ransom. He said before they commenced negotiation, Siasia requested to speak with his mother to ascertain proof of life. “He didn’t just speak to his mother. He also spoke to the other woman and her teenage daughter. At least we are happy that mama is still alive. We are begging them to release their victims unconditionally”, he said. The Nation
