By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Federal lawmaker representing Imo West, Senator Rochas Okorocha, on Tuesday said it is an insult for the National Assembly to issue an ultimatum to Governor Godwin Obaseki on the crisis rocking the Edo State House of Assembly. According to Okorocha, “It is like we are eager to take over the Edo State House of Assembly. Looking at the report of both the party and the facts, it looks like a family affair of APC which the leadership of APC should find a way to solve”. “There is no proof whatsoever that the Edo State House of Assembly is not functioning”. ” We can’t be talking of three weeks ultimatum if the governor does not do that. I was once a governor. It is not proper for us to say if governor does not issue a fresh proclamation, we are going to take over the Assembly”. “So I think we should look into this before we bring ourselves to ridicule by interfering in a matter we shouldn’t have interfered in” he said. Senate committee set up to look into the circumstances surrounding the inauguration of Edo State Assembly submitted its report today and faulted the method of the inauguration by Governor Godwin Obaseki and recommended that he issues a fresh proclamation before one week or risk the take over the state Assembly by senate.
