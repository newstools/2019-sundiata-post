By Mabel Yakubu Kaduna – A Chief Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday ordered that a 27-year-old farmer, Suleiman Isah, be remanded in prison, over alleged culpable homicide. The defendant, a resident of Kwassau Village, Soba Local Government Area of Kaduna State, is charged with culpable homicide. The Magistrate, Mrs Hajara Dauda, declined to take the plea of the defendant on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction. Dauda said that the offence could only be tried by a High Court. She, however, ordered the police to forward the case file to the State Director of Public Prosecutions, for legal advice. The magistrate adjourned the matter until Aug. 7 for mention. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Insp. Sunday Baba, had told the court that the complainant, Kargi Adamu of Kaffi Village in Kubau Local Government Area, Kaduna State, reported the matter at Soba Police Station on June 5. Baba said at 11 a.m., the defendant attacked the complainant’s grandson, Umar Sani, during an altercation. He alleged that in the cause of the argument, the defendant killed the complainant’s son and dumped his corpse by the  river at Yanta farm in Kubau Local Government Area of Kaduna State. He noted that during investigation, the defendant confessed to the crime. According to him, the offence contravened the provisions of Section 190 of the Kaduna State Penal Code Law, 2017.
