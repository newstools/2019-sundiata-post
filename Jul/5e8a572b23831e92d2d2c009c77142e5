A brilliantly taken goal by Thembinkosi Lorch has given #BafanaBafana a 1-0 victory over #ThePharaohs to set up a mouthwatering clash with Nigeria in the quarter-finals. In what must rank as one of the biggest upsets of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), underdogs South Africa on Saturday night eliminated hosts Egypt after a dominant display. Playing an hour after Nigeria shot down defending champions Cameroun to power into the quarter-finals, Bafana Bafana followed suit by outclassing a star-studded Pharaohs side that included the mercurial African Footballer of the Year Mohammed Salah.
