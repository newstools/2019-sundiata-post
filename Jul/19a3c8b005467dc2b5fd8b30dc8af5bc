Wizkid’s third baby mama, Jada Pollock has taken to social media to add a new twist to domestic allegation claims against the singer by alleging that her account was hacked. While posting an apology, Jada Pollock, who also doubles as the “Ojuelegba” hitmaker’s manager disclosed that the statement did not emanate from her and is the work of hackers who compromised her account. She wrote: “My phone was hacked in the late hours of Monday evening and my Instagram account was compromised. I can guarantee that the statement written was not my hand. I can only apologise for and confusion this may have caused. I have now recovered my account.”,
