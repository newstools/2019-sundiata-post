Youths in Plateau State, Tuesday warned the Nigerian government against imposing the suspended Ruga settlement program on them. Government had commenced the program without the inputs of farmers, thus making it questionable and tantamount to land-grabbing, the “Concerned Youths” from Bokkos Local Government Area told journalists in Jos, the capital of the State. The group alleged that the government had planned to secretly site the Ruga settlement in Bokkos before withdrawing to “change strategy”. “We fear that the suspension is only aimed at changing strategy, especially in view of the FG’s recent plan to repeal the Land Use Act,” spokesperson of the group, Mr. Macham Makut said. The youths opted for Livestock Alimentation as against the Ruga livestock system. “Livestock Alimentation means replicating the existing practices in poultry farming for cows, pigs, goats, and sheep which are the commonly known destructive animals when left to stray. “This will require a transformation of the existing cattle paddocks otherwise known as hoggo in Fulfulde or shinge in Hausa to feedlots,” said its spokesperson.
