Details have emerged after Busola Dakolo who accused Senior Pastor of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), Biodun Fatoyinbo of raping her filed a complaint against the clergy at the police station. A YNaija report has revealed that Busola Dakolo’s legal representative filed the petition at the office of the Assistant Inspector-General of Police in Lagos on 27th June, 2019, a day before the release of the video where she narrated her harrowing story of rape by Fatoyinbo. According to YNaija, a source in the office of the AIG confirmed the news and said: “Yes, she already came to the police to file a case with us before she even came to the public. The case is here with us in Lagos. Some of the Ogas here say the Biodun man has found out and is trying to move the case to Abuja, but that is not possible because the lady in question is resident here and she filed here. Investigation is ongoing, and I am telling you, what we are finding is bigger than what the mouth can say.” Source
