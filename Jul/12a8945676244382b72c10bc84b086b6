Before appointing these ex-governors as ministers, shouldn’t a responsible leader examine their record as governors or better yet ask the people of their states about what the former governors did for and to them? Should a ministerial appointment not be a reward for good performance in public service at the state level, an opportunity to scale up or replicate, at the national level, what the nominee has done at the state level? Besides setting a record for salaries owed and debts accumulated, what did Aregbesola do for Osun to merit his nomination and “promotion” to a federal ministerial appointment? If Buhari had asked us in Benue, we would have given him an earful about what Akume did to the state, a damage from which we’re still recovering. After months of allegedly searching, Buhari did not find any Benue person worthier than Akume and has decided to reward the former governor for his abysmal tenure as governor. Source: Facebook
