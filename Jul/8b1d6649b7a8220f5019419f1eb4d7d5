Prof Chidi Odinkalu writes about the controversial Ruga Settlement and how the issue can be an opportunity to finally resolve the lingering farmer-herders crisis that has led to the loss of many lives. The presidency have tried to explain its way out of the Ruga controversy, but continuous revelations have shown that Ruga is an oversight not originally listed in the National Livestock Transformation Plan supervised by the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo whom has also denied any knowledge of the herders settlement program. See Odinkalu’s thread below: 1 good thing abt the on-going controversy over #RUGAMania in #Nigeria is it has brought attention back to what cn be done to address the herder-farmer crises. Since ystrday, a few more ppl have askd me abt the National Livestock Transformation Plan #NLTP. Here's a little more…. The struture & process was inclusive. Consultations took place at state & zonal levels, culminating in a national conference 11-15 Sept 2017 in Abuja with over 770 participants. The National Conference adopted a report which was transmitted to @AuduOgbeh in December 2017 pic.twitter.com/cvJ7tKJIpK The conference proposed a #NLTP as a "first phase of a long termtransformation process of the livestock industry" with a tenure of 10 yrs, 2018-2027. Upon adoption by the NEC in Jan 2019, it's tenure was adjusted to 2019-2028https://t.co/VzS2gYnsjK pic.twitter.com/CEx2rLa5Rm The #NLTP addressed different things. Take ranching for instance. What it proposes is "a compete departure from the past failed ranching attempts in that they will be business-orientated rathe than public orientated in both ownership & management." pic.twitter.com/ZogX62ll1j The #NLTP extensively dealt with the issue of conflict stabilization & resolution including the problem of Small Arms & Light Weapons (SALWs), offering also the promise of "inclusive dialogue in support of peaceful coexistence." pic.twitter.com/GnSUwyQPBa There is also a #LawAndOrder element in the #NLTP under the #CriminalJustice Pillar, which undertakes to model & pilot Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) processes in the 7 pilot States within in support of stabilization & sensible coexistence pic.twitter.com/gyc8szadMO While they all offered money, difft states also offered difft things. Benue State, for instance, offered land NOT for #GrazingReserve or Ruga but for fodder production, which cld be sold to other states. In effect, the #NLTP offered to grow an internal market in Livestock Biz. The Cabinet approved these sums in the twilight of the last tenure knowing there wld be no oversight of the spends; the money was not appropriated & the contracts all got #DueProcess waivers. Ruga is not just a story of overreach, it is also a tale of awful corruption & sleaze.
