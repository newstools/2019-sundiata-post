Bandits, suspected to be Fulani herdsmen, have attacked the Great Saints Orphanage in Issele-Uku, in the Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State, destroying parts of the building and the vehicles parked in the compound. The founder of the orphanage, Mr Emeka Ezeagbor, who expressed shock at the extent fellow human beings could go to destroy a humanitarian facility built to assist the underprivileged, stated that the attack was carried out around 5am on Monday. He wondered what could have been the reason for the bandits to break into the home and destroy it. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Onome Onovwakpoyeya, who confirmed the incident, said, “Yes, we got the information about the incident and we are trying to get the details from the DPO of Issele-Uku. “Even though I have got it, I can’t reveal the details until I get approval from my CP.” As of press time, the PPRO failed to reach out to our correspondent for details of the attack. It was gathered that some herdsmen organised a party in the area on Sunday and were alleged to have been drunk and were fighting among themselves in the bush around that orphanage. Source
