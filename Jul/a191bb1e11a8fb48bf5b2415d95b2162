Another former member of Commonwealth Zion Assembly (COZA) has come out to accuse embattled Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of raping her. This is coming when the dust raised by a similar accusation by Mrs Busola Dakolo is yet to settle.  According to the lady, whose identity is yet to be revealed, in an interview with Chude Jideonwo on Ynaija TV, Pastor Fatoyinbo asked her to come to his house on the particular day (a Thursday morning) to take some instructions and go for an errand. It was on that day that he r*ped her. “He was my boss. I worked with him. Sometimes I had to do errands for them. So it was not the first time that I was going to be at their house. “I was their sitting on the couch with him and he started addressing something that has to do with the church. “Everything moved quickly from there and then he started trying to pull me into a hug and started kissing me which I found shocking. I had known him as a spiritual leader and I was about to witness opposite of everything that I thought he stood for. “I was too shocked. It was a couch. I don’t know whether I should hold on to something. I remember telling him continuously ‘you can’t do that, you can’t do that.’ “He just kept going. Took off my button and my trouser. And then he had his other hand holding me back to the couch. “I remember he kept saying, relax. Just relax. He didn’t flinch.” The lady added that he regarded Pastor Fatoyinbo as a father figure and a mentor before the sad incident. Watch video below: Source
