The NISE National Chairman, Mr Adeyemi Oyedepo, conferred the award on Olateru after his decoration at the bureau’s office, Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja. Oyedepo said, “The conferment is an opportunity to honour and celebrate with Nigerians and non-Nigerian members who had attained the highest level in engineering safety.” He urged the awardees to see the fellowship as a call to render more engineering safety service, saying that it would motivate them to mentor others. Commenting, Olateru thanked the institution for the recognition and awarding him the fellowship in safety engineering. “I thank you for your support and recognition. I will uphold the ethics, and also try my best anywhere I find myself. “The Royal Aeronautical Society of UK recently awarded me Fellowship and I am the first in Africa to be awarded. “The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport also awarded me a fellowship two weeks ago. “So, I have moved from being a chartered member to a Fellow of the Institute. “These are kind of things that give me joy. I believe everything is not about money, but our commitment, being focus and doing good job,” he said. (NAN)
