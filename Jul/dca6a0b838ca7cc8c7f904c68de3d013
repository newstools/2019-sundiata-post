Following the announcement of the long awaited Ministerial List from President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigerians have taken to social media to share their thoughts. The unanimous opinion suggests that there is little to be excited about, given the names on the list who are already old guns in the system. So many Surprise on #TheList . Ambode exclusion is quite surprising but when VC does not forgive you what can you do. Gbemi saraki hmm don't trust that woman at all. But my joy is that Buhari didn't return Dalung& lshittu. Good to see Aregbesola on the list #MinisterialList pic.twitter.com/B3KTrlvOyf President Buhariâ€™s #MinisterialList will sure move Nigeria backwards. Iâ€™m shocked over some names on this list like Gbemi Saraki & Godswill Akpabio. Not to mention my total disbelieve that Ambode didnâ€™t make it to #TheList pic.twitter.com/VwrPp4Wrx0 It took the president of Nigeria 4 months to select this compensation list cum ministerial list.Akpabio will help fight corruption and Gbemi Saraki will help him manage the economy.With an unaware President. Akpabio has EFCC,breathing down his neck,how did he make the list?,Gbemi Saraki nomination, was to spite her brother,Onu,Ngige,are dead candidates.Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, hopefully will reciprocate the visionary achievements he made both in Lagos and Osun State. There's nothing in this #MinisterialList that inspires hope. It's made up of mostly politicians. @MBuhari is big on rewarding political patronage. There's noting wrong with rewarding loyalty but sacrificing competence while doing that, is totally unacceptable. They've turned ministerial appointment to governors' retirement scheme. These same people that failed their states for about 8 years have been appointed to fail the nation for d next 4. Sorry 4 Nigeria!!! #MinisterialList Ambode's Entourage reaction after discoverying Ambode's name was missing on the #MinisterialList pic.twitter.com/DKgGX2JrLi #MinisterialList This list I believe is dead on Arrival . Most people on this team is a No for me. We need innovative minds not pArtisans trying to get positions. Who have we offended?ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜£ pic.twitter.com/Fx5IFcWRYW
