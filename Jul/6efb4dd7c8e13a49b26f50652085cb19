New Delhi – India and Iran on Thursday condemned the killing of a Turkish diplomat in the Iraqi Kurdistan. A Turkish diplomat was among two people shot dead on Wednesday in Irbil, the capital of Iraq’s Kurdistan region. The victims, identified as Turkey’s deputy consul and an Iraqi civilian, were eating at a restaurant on Wednesday when gunmen opened fire upon them. “India condemns the terrorist attack in Irbil. We extend our condolences to the families of the deceased including a diplomat from Turkey,” India’s foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said. “India has always opposed and rejected terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and has urged concerted action by the international community against terrorism, including cross-border terrorism.” Also, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi expressed sympathy for the Turkish government, nation, and families of the victims. “Terrorism is a horrendous phenomenon that has inflicted extensive damage on regional states,” Mousavi said. “The only way to combat terrorism is concerted action by the international community by putting an end to the political, financial, ideological, and arms support for the terrorist groups,” he added.
