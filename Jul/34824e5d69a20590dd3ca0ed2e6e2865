Big Brother Naija, housemate, Frodd has emerged as the BBnaija winner for this week’s Head of House, HoH, challenge for the ‘Pepper dem gang’ edition. The position of HoH is usually assumed by a winner of the weekly task as instructed by Biggie. Two weeks ago, Esther emerged Head of House. It would be recalled that there was no Head of House last week and all housemates were put up for eviction. In today’s task, housemates were assigned #BBNaija’s bursting balloon challenge; they were given balloons to attach to their feet and were instructed to burst each other’s balloons until there’s a last man standing. After Jeff and Frodd went on for some minutes in the final round without a winner emerging, Big Brother instructed that they use 30 seconds to resolve on who the winner was. Frodd emerged winner as Jeff gave up the position by joining the other housemates on the bench in the Arena room. According to Big Brother, the HoH gets the honour of sitting on the Head of House seat, 250 coins, as well as the luxury of a tastefully furnished Head of House bedroom. Frodd decided to share the luxury of the Head of House bedroom with fellow housemate, Mike. Frodd’s emergence is coming just a day after Nelson and Thelma got evicted. Source
