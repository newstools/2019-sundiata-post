Prof Chidi Odinkalu has added his voice to the ongoing debate about RUGA settlement. Not satisfied with the statement by Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu that Ruga was intended to end the farmers herders clashes, Prof Chidi Odinkalu shows how the statement is faulty and how inconceivable it is for the FG to go on with Ruga. See thread below: There are various categories of ppl involved in the #RUGAMania conversation. There're those who:(a) won't do their home work(b) can't do their home work(c) cldn't be bothered abt home work(d) are allergic to facts(e) are genuinely curious.Only the last deserve attention. The entire controversy over #RUGAMania is worse than a distraction.

Beyond those, however, there is enough land for a serious govt to have done a lot well b4 now to demonstrate it cases abt the Farmer-Herder crisis It's not difficult, therefore, to see how or why the release by @GarShehu last night was somewhere between an afterthought & off the mark. The facts are clear & straightforward. This was a project that the Governors drove. Ppl shd ask how, why & when they gave it up.
