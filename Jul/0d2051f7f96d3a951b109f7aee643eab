Dear Applicants, I think it all depends on who is looking at your CV and what he or she believes your CV should look like. My advise is to keep it simple and communicate your strength and achievements. A good grade out of school will place you on high pedestal such that you don’t need to struggle too much to get some opportunities. Please go for it. If you ask me, I would say after school is school. For the ambitious ones that have put in their best, after school: (1) Look for scholarship opportunities to study abroad (2) Look for job opportunities available for you around Below are 7 reasons your CV isn’t getting you those interviews you so desperately needed. This should be a guideline in making your CV professional. Source
