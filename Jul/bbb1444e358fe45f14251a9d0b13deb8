This year’s Big Brother Naija 2019 reality show tagged ‘Pepper Dem’ is living up to its name as the tensed housemates await the first eviction this Sunday. Just days after Tacha and Thelma were involved in a heated argument over meat and fish, two other housemates have knocked heads. This time, it was over cleaning and doing the dishes. The drama started when Ella called Diane out for not washing her plates she used after eating. Things took a swift dimension as Diane didn’t find it funny and the house was set for a shouting bout.
