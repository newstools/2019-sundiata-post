Former Super Eagles captain and coach Christian Chukwu has thanked oil mogul Femi Otedola for coming to his rescue while he was down with what was suspected to be a stroke. Chukwu’s family raised alarm over the health condition of the former Rangers international chairman, before Otedola came into the fray and opted to take up his medical bills. However, Chukwu returned to Nigeria on Friday from London, after nearly two months in London, where he underwent treatment and surgery at Wellington Hospital. The 1980 African Cup of Nations winning captain said he was in critical condition, before the intervention of Otedola, who spentN36,635,000 on his treatment, travel and accommodation expenses. “Otedola has made me, I can play football again,” Chukwu said. “If you saw me before I left for London, you won’t believe I’ll be here talking to you. I think I won’t be making a mistake if I say after God, it’s Otedola in my life. “I had many complications and I couldn’t walk. When I heard Otedola brought out money for my treatment, I marvelled because in my circle, we didn’t know him before then. We have people with us but maybe they forgot or it’s not in their character (to help). I don’t know how to thank Otedola enough, God bless him.” Chukwu’s wife, Lilian, who was with him alongside his daughter and sister throughout the duration of treatment in London, also thanked Otedola for coming to their aid. “God used him to bring my husband back to life. He (Otedola) will never lack,” Lilian stated. (Brila FM)
