By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu – Commissioner of Police in Enugu State, Mr Suleiman Balarabe, has urged security agencies in the state to adhere strictly to tenets of the constitution as it affects fundamental human rights of suspects. Balarabe gave the charge on Friday during the closing ceremony of a two-day workshop on “Community Oriented Policing’’ in Enugu. According to him, we should try as much as possible to adhere strictly to the tenets of the constitution as it affects human rights in performing our duties. “I also charge participants to implement what they have learnt in performance of their duty and better our service delivery to the residents of the state and Nigerians in general,’’ the commissioner said. On the theme of the workshop, `Community Oriented Policing’, he said that the involvement of all stakeholders, which community policing engendered made fighting crime less cumbersome. Balarabe noted that most places and countries where it had been effectively deployed and practised, the positive results on reduction of crime and criminality had been overwhelming. The commissioner pledged command’s commitment to partner with sister security agencies to ensure continuous peace, safety and security of lives and property in the state. Earlier, in a goodwill message, the outgoing Controller of Prisons in the state, Mr Ndubuisi Ogbodo, thanked the police commissioner for the all-important workshop meant to strengthen the synergy among all policing agencies in the state. Ogbodo said that policing agencies needed to mainstream their activities towards community policing to galvanise community stakeholders’ participation for effective security. The workshop was organised by the Nigeria Policing Programme (NPP) in conjunction with the State Police Command for area commanders, divisional police officers and senior officers in Enugu State.
