CAIRO – The head of Sudan’s ruling military council said on Tuesday there must be immediate accountability over an incident in which at least four school children were shot dead on Monday, according to state news agency SUNA. “What happened in El-Obeid is a regrettable and upsetting matter and the killing of peaceful citizens is unacceptable and rejected and a crime that requires immediate and deterrent accountability,” Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was quoted as saying.
