Don Jazzy led other celebrities on social media as they frowned at the abusive nature of Big Brother Naija housemate, Tacha towards her fellow housemates. Celebrities and Nigerians on social media have called on Big Brother to sanction Tacha over her latest insults on fellow housemates for no obvious reason. Recall that Tacha had abused Mike and Omashola after the afterparty last night. She had earlier abused Frodd over the week too with many people raising eyebrows. Reacting, Don Jazzy took to twitter and wrote: “Tacha is being really disrespectful to Mike now. distasteful It’s not nice how the girls are quick to start abusing the guys sha. any small thing shut up idiot get out fuck off stupid fool do your worse. na wa oo.” Other celebrities like Uti Nwachukwu, Juliet Ibrahim, and Lilian Afegbai have all condemned her.
