Big Brother Naija 2019 has officially started, and as usual, the drama is on. These two ladies, Mercy and Tacha already got tongues wagging on Twitter, and they have also been trending since Ebuka introduced them on stage. 26-year-old Mercy Eke, a video vixen and businesswoman based in Lagos, got people’s attention with the sexy sheer gown she wore to the live show, which showed off her banging body. She loves cooking, swimming, travelling and dancing. No matter the setbacks, Mercy always picks herself up and does her best. When she’s not dancing, singing or rapping, Mercy makes time to enjoy her favourite food: white rice and pepper soup. Y’all remember Tacha, the babe that faked a public proposal, faked her own kidnap and went viral for tattooing Davido’s music label logo on her chest? Well, Tacha has always wanted to be on Big Brother Naija. It comes as no surprise then, that getting picked to be a Housemate this season, is the highlight of her life. This spunky 23-year-old Rivers State indigene got tongues wagging immediately Ebuka introduced her on stage. Tacha is a social media sensation who is known to show off her boobs and butts on Instagram. She would pick her phone over sleep, any day. Although losing her mom weighs heavily on her. Why will you be a fan favourite? “Because I’m Symply Tacha. I’m spontaneous, loud, interesting, lively and fun,” she said. Source
