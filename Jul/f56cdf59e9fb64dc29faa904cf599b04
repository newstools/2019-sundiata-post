I had a bizarre experience in Abuja. And it happened twice. When we stopped to buy a magazine from a newspaper vendor at Wuse II, this guy came running frantically to us speaking Yoruba and aggressively trying to market some sort of local aphrodisiac to us. The stuff looked like little plant seeds in a small bottle. He was an aggressive marketer. We passed, but it left me wondering why, first, he was speaking Yoruba (which none of us spoke) to us, and second, why he thought I might need the help. Did I fit any kind of profile or was he just approaching all middle aged men who stopped in traffic to buy stuff from hawkers? The next day, outside a supermarket in Garki, this young man–likely a teenager–approached me speaking Hausa and trying to market his own brand of local aphrodisiac, presumably a variety of burantashi. He too was super-aggressive. He even said he could offer me a sample for free to try and that he would be in the same spot and that he was sure that I would come back after the trial. Again, I passed on his generous offer. The last time I was offered a burantashi free trial was almost twenty years ago in Kaduna when me and my friend stopped at a filling station to buy petrol. We were in our twenties. My friend felt offended and angrily asked the guy why he thought everyone was sexually active and what made him think that if we were we would need “foreign aid” at our age. Anyway, the latest encounters with aphrodisiac salesmen, their aggressive sales tactics, and the back-to-back nature of the encounters made me wonder. Are these guys smart entrepreneurs catering to a growing demand for masculine “foreign aid” or are they simply a part of Nigeria’s growing economy of quack, opportunistic cure-all traditional medicine, where hustlers try to profit from all kinds of societal anxieties?
