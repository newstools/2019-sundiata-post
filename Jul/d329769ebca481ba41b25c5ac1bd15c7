Nigerian musicians, Eedris Abdulkareem, Baba Fryo, and Felix Duke on Monday, led protesters to the Redeemed Christian Church of God camp along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, to demand that Pastor Enoch Adeboye, speak on the RUGA settlement project initiated by the federal government. The Federal Government had on Wednesday announced the suspension of the project, following reactions from Nigerians. In a video shared on his unverified Instagram page, Abdulkareem, a rapper said, “We are here to see Baba Adeboye, who is our father. We love him so much and we want him to speak and he must speak. It is very important for him to speak. “I’m here with Baba Fryo, I’m here with Felix Duke and we are here to say ‘Baba speak up’. You have talked about COZA, now, we want you to talk about RUGA.” (Agency report)
