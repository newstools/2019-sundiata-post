Rapper Olamide is set to welcome another child with OAP Maria Okan, just days after welcoming a son with his fiancée, Bukunmi. According to a credible insider, after Maria discovered that she was one month pregnant for Olamide, she approached him and requested for money to terminate the pregnancy and return to the U.K. A source revealed that the rapper obliged and gave her the sum of N2m. The radio presenter thereafter resigned from Beat FM and left for London. However, on getting there, she decided to keep the pregnancy, thus causing serious tension between the erstwhile lovers, due to the sudden breach of agreement. Seeing that the situation won’t change and it was getting messy, Olamide opened up to his then pregnant fiancée, Bukunmi, and he was forgiven. Maria is expected to put to bed any moment from now.
