Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission, Abike Dabiri, has assured Nigerians that the Xenophobic attacks being experienced in South Africa will be brought to an end. She stated this on Tuesday while addressing protesters from the National of Nigerian Students (FCT) who came to the South Africa High Commission in Abuja. She assured the nation that adequate actions will be taken to ensure justice is served, thereby urging youths not to take matters into their hands. Hon. Dabiri after addressing the protesters entered a closed door meeting with the South African high commissioner. The meeting comes barely 24-hours after Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, condemned the continuous killings of Nigerians in South Africa, warning that further attack on Nigerians would no longer be condoned. He stated this while receiving the South African High Commissioner to Nigeria Mr. Bobby Moroe. Mr Moroe visited the Senate President on Monday to unravel the causes of the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and steps being taken to curb it. Source: Channels Tv
