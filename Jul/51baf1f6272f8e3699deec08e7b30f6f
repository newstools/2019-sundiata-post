Once an eagle, always an eagle 🦅 🇳🇬 pic.twitter.com/MJzJBUPc6U Unsurprisingly,Mikel Obi has retired from the Super Eagles. It is somewhat poetic that his first & last AFCON tournaments were held in Egypt.89 caps over 13 yrs is outstanding.He easily could have played 8 AFCON tournaments instead of 6. Great career. Deserves our gratitude.
