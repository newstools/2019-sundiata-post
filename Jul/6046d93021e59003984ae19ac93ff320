Taiye Elebiyo-Edeni Abuja – ECOWAS Parliamentarian Hon. Sale Poli has praised the Centre for Renewable Energy and Industrial Maintenance (CERMI) for delivering its mandate on renewable energy production of above 4,000 megawatts. Poli, who is from Cote d’ Ivoire stated this when he led a delegation from the parliament on an oversight visit to the centre, in Praia, Cape Verde. “CERMI is a project of ECOWAS to develop renewable energy in the region; it also plays a leading role in the operational instrument in implementing government policies,’’ Poli said. Mr. Luis Teixeira, the Chief Executive Officer of CERMI, said that a development partner of CERMI, LuxDev (Luxemburg Agency for Development Cooperation) was responsible for the implementation of the RAR-CERMI Project. He said that the objective of the partnership with the Luxemburg agency was to further support CERMI in its efforts to transform into a centre of regional excellence. He said that the partner would finance the project with 20 million pounds for a period of three years. According to him, the project consists of implementing two large-scale activities for the AGoSE-AO action programme, a train-the-trainers programme and support for the regionalisation of CERMI. Teixeira said that Cape Verde clearly recognised the importance of renewable energy for its strategic development. He said that the project would have regional coverage in successive and progressive phases in all ECOWAS member states including Mauritania, noting it has seven implementing partners within the region.
