The Buhari regime is consciously incubating a Shiite insurrection, a Shiite version of Boko Haram, amid already heartrendingly widening and deepening insecurity in most parts of the country. I’d warned that Shias would become violent and take on the state, but several Shias told me the El-Zakzaky tendency of Shiism, while invested in martyrdom and self-abnegation, is largely pacifist. They said there’s no theological justification for offensive violence in their own version of Shiism. But the English say even a worm will turn, which means even the most pacifist person will react violently if you push him too far and too hard. That is precisely what the Buhari regime is doing. The regime murdered at least 1,000 Shias, including El-Zakazy’s children, has refused to release El-Zakzaky in spite of several court orders asking it to do so, and claims to be trying him even when he is the victim of their murderous highhandedness. Peaceful protests by his supporters are often met with unwarranted violence, which instigates retaliatory violence. Violence begets violence. Meanwhile a general in Buhari’s military said repentant Boko Haram members can become presidents. Buhari is clearly on a mission to dissolve Nigeria by drowning it in oceans of blood. Source: Facebook
