Despite his side’s recent win against Bafana Bafana, the tactician is wary of the challenge his side will face when they take on Djamel Belmadi’s men
Article continues below Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr denied suggestions his team are favourites going into Sunday’s Africa Cup of Nations clash against Algeria.
The North Africans triumphed over Cote d’Ivoire on penalties to secure a place in the last four while the Super Eagles defeated South Africa in a fiercely contested quarter-final game. Ahead of this clash at Cairo’s football cathedral, Rohr’s men are widely perceived to be odds-on favourites having silenced Bafana Bafana, who knocked out hosts Egypt. The German, however, does not feel his side should be considered the favourites against Djamel Belmadi’s side, who finished as group winners. “When you beat the favourites, you are also one of the favourites. That was my opinion and it is still my opinion,” Rohr told the media.

We are all here and Algeria is playing so well. “All is open but it’s reflecting that there are two countries from Morth Africa and two countries from West Africa.” Algeria and Nigeria will face each other for the ninth time in Afcon history, and Rohr is upbeat his side will be fit for the crunch tie. “After the difficult match against South Africa, we had to recover at first and during our training the next morning, we saw that some of our players had small injuries and we tried to give them the best treatments,” he continued. “We will have our last training this evening and hopefully all my players would be very fit.” Source: Goal
