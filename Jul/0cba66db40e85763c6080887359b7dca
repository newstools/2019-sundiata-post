Evicted Big Brother Naija housemate Tuoyo has said he suspects Tacha is using Juju to make her stay in the house. He made the statement while speaking on LITV on a show with Hero Daniels where he also revealed that Tacha is at the same time proud. He said: “Tacha is proud. She thinks she’s confident but she’s proud. When I first heard about the Juju stuff in the house, I gave a second thought to it. Her over confidence makes me think that she there might be something spiritual backing her up. For her to say, till the 99th she would still be at the big brother house. That means there is a backup. It might be financial, but I think it is spiritual. Something is really shaky there. That was it bead says a lot. Since she’s friend with Jaruma that sells spiritual items, I think 70% of me thinks she is using juju” Earlier this month, Big Brother Naija host, Ebuka was forced to put housemate, Jackye on the spot about a conversation she had with a fellow housemate accusing Tacha of ‘witchcraft’ during the eviction show. Jackye didn’t deny having the conversation, but Tacha later laughed off the accusation.
