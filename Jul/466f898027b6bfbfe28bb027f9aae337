This is the terrifying moment a knifeman stabbed Hong Kong actor Simon Yam on Saturday during a promotional event in Southern China. The actor, who played the villain Chen Lo in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003), endured a minor operation to treat the non-life-threatening injuries following the attack, Chinese state media reported. A video was posted on China’s e Weibo service showing a man in a dark vest rushing up to the stage and attacking Yam with a knife in the city of Zhongshan in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. A suspect was detained following the attack in the Zhongshan Huoju Development Zone in Guangdong province, police said, however the motive for the attack was unclear. The 64-year-old actor underwent a minor operation at a hospital in Zhongshan city, his manager Lester Mo said. ‘He was stabbed in the tummy area and also got a cut on his right hand,’ Mo said. He was still being treated for injuries to the four fingers of his right hand. Citing a police statement, it said the attacker had not yet been identified, but that Yam appeared to have been a victim of mistaken identity. Yam won critical acclaim for his role in the Hong Kong crime film Contact in 1992 and made his Hollywood debut in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life in 2003. He is also a film producer. Yam, who is also known by his Chinese name Yam Tat-wah, has appeared in more than 125 movies and 40 television series. Daily Mail UK
