Sam Adeyemi, the Senior Pastor of Daystar Christian Center, has reacted to the r*pe allegation leveled against COZA founder, Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, by Busola, the wife of singer Timi Dakolo. In a statement released this afternoon, Adeyemi expressed sympathy for Busola Dakolo and all those that have been affected since she came out to relieve her experiences with the clergyman. Adeyemi asked for patience while legal processes are instituted to unravel the truth. Read his statement below: “My attention has been drawn to the allegations of rape made against Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo by Mrs Busola Dakolo. These are, no doubt, serious allegations. Rape is a crime and I say a firm NO to r*pe. “As Christians, it is only appropriate for us to seek for truth, justice, healing, and restoration for all involved. The Bible instructs us to do this with humility (Galatians 6:1). “While these are still allegations, I emphatise with Mrs Dakolo and everyone that has been affected, and I pray God’s peace for them at this time. “While the allegations have been refuted, I hope there will be a process, legal or counseling, to establish the truth in these circumstances. “Meanwhile, let us pray for peace and strength for everyone hurting in this process, for the families of the accusers and the accused, and the Church. “#truth #justice #healing #restoration”
