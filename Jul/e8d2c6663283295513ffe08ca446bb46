The Noble Laureate is one of the great voices we grew up to know in the struggle against several military dictators (head of states). “His role in the June 12 struggle can never be forgotten, and it was several of his agitations and the likes of late Gani Fawehinmi that motivated some of us to choose the line of fighting for a just cause. “We are using this medium to reassure our noble laureate that we shall continue to uphold the spirit of doggedness to ensure we achieve the Nigeria of our dream that people like him have stood for,” he said. The group wished Soyinka many more happy and fruitful years on earth in good health and wealth. (NAN)
