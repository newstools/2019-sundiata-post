JOHANNESBURG – South Africa’s rand weakened against the dollar in early trade on Tuesday as investors looked ahead to state-owned Eskom’s financial results and unemployment data out later in the day. At 0705 GMT, the rand fell 0.34% to 14.2125 per dollar. State power firm Eskom financial results for the 2018/19 financial year are expected to show a large loss and steep increase in debt. Rating agencies Fitch and Moody’s last week both warned about fiscal pressure on South Africa and highlighted Eskom as a risk, piling pressure on the currency. Statistics South Africa will also release second-quarter unemployment figures on Tuesday. In fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 was up 3 basis points to 8.345%. Stocks opened slightly weaker with the All-share index down 0.14% to 57,954 points, while the Top-40 indexI dipped 0.05% to 51,950 points. ( Reuters)
