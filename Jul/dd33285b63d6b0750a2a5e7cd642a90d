By Peter Okolie Ekwulobia (Anambra) – The National Population Commission (NPC) has advised its personnel engaged in the ongoing Enumeration Area Demarcation in Anambra to avoid errors capable of marring the outcome of the exercise.Mr Chidi Ezeoke, the Federal Commissioner for Anambra, gave the advice on Monday, while declaring open a three-day training programme for 57 supervisors and demarcators at Ekwulobia in Aguata Local Government Area.Ezeoke described the 21-day exercise as a critical element that would constitute the foundation on which the entire census architecture would stand.He said that the overall result of the census could be marred by mistakes made during the demarcation.He said: “This job is a critical national assignment and must be given all the seriousness it deserved.“You must consider yourselves lucky to be engaged to work for Nigeria and you can’t afford to fail the nation.“If you make any mistakes, the output will be faulty and you will have yourselves to blame.“We will therefore not hesitate to kick out anyone who makes mistakes in the course of the job.”Ezeoke, who said that five local government areas of the state had so far been demarcated, expressed the hope that the remaining council areas would be covered in record time.He urged the leaderships of the host communities to provide conducive environment, including taking care of the officers to motivate them to give their best.He underscored the need for the communities to allow the officials unfettered access to facilities and places listed for demarcation.The commissioner also solicited the support and cooperation of the residents of the area to allow the demarcators to carry out their duties professionally.
