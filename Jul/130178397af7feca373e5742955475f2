The abductors of the Permanent Secretary, Adamawa State Ministry of Mineral Resources, Mr Emmanuel Piridimso, have demanded a ransom of N25m for his release. The gunmen abducted the government official from his residence at the Clerk Quarters, Jimeta-Yola, in the early hours of Wednesday. A family member, who pleaded anonymity, told our correspondent that the kidnappers allowed their captive speak to members of his family, but insisted that they would only negotiate the ransom with the state government. The source said, “The abductors have allowed the permanent secretary to speak to us intermittently as they said they will only talk to the government. “He told us that they were demanding the sum of N25m; that was why he asked us to sell off his car and any other property that could fetch money, and also appeal to friends and well-wishers. “We tried to collect his car, which the abductors took away with him, but it was dumped in Jambutu and later taken to the police headquarters, but the police have refused to release the car saying that they would conduct some investigations on it and as such, we could not take it away.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Sulaiman Nguroje, said the command was on the trail of the kidnappers and was doing all it could to secure the release of the victim and bring the perpetrators to justice.
