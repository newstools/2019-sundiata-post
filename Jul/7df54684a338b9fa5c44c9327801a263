By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, (NAFDAC), has shut down three factories over alleged use of chemicals used for embalming corpse to preserve hides. These factories which specialize in the importation of hides otherwise known as “Ponmo” are located in Alimosho Local government area of Lagos state.  Speaking with journalists shortly after the arrest, the Deputy Director, Intelligence Unit, NAFDAC, Mr Francis Ononiwu confirmed the arrest of one of the factories owner, me Nwaebo. His words: “When we first called at Nwaebo’s factory last week, there was a large number of hides; it appeared as if he just had his delivery. We decided to lock up the place and placed our seal on the door. When we came to check the place on Tuesday, the hides had all been removed. He has to explain how and why the hides disappeared from the place we locked up.“ There are so many imported hide factories in Lagos. The hides are preserved with the same chemical used for embalming corpses. They are not safe for human consumption. We have been fighting them and we will get to them anywhere they are.”
