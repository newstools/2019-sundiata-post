Abuja (Sundiata Post) – A non-governmental organisation (NGO), Democracy Vanguard of Nigerians in Diaspora (DVND), has written to the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Stuart Symington, calling for the immediate probe of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, over his role in the 2019 presidential polls. The correspondence, signed by its president, Timothy A. Sule, also called for the investigation of Governor Nasir El-Rufai and his remarks before, during and after this year’s general elections. The group alleged that the outcome of the polls was not a reflection of the will of Nigerians, adding that the exercise was marred by violence and intimidation. DVND stated: “There was clear voter suppression in the southern part of Nigeria (opposition strongholds); some northern states, especially Kano, witnessed flagrant voter inflation to meet up with the minimum 25 per cent constitutional requirement. “Influential opposition leaders were randomly and recklessly arrested and incarcerated on trumped-up charges with the sole aim of keeping them out of circulation.” According to them, the incidents affected the outcome of the elections. “The aftermath of the exercise was predictable and expectedly, the opposition was rigged out against the clear wishes and aspirations of the majority of Nigerians,” they added.
