A columnist with The Punch, Abimbola Adelakun, has been released after she was briefly held up for questioning by security agents on Sunday at the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA) in Abuja. Adelakun had published a column at the back page of Punch newspapers on July 4 with the title “What Does Mrs. Fatoyinbo Know”. The article, which examined the rape allegations against Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, was illustrated with the cartoon of a man desecrating the bible with urine. Fatoyinbo was recently accused of rape by Busola, wife of singer Timi Dakolo. The cartoon was greeted with backlash from readers, ultimately leading to the firing of the editor of the paper’s daily title, Martin Ayankola. Adelakun, who said she was at the church on Sunday in furtherance of her research on Pentecostal churches, said she was pulled out of the church by the church’s security men, who recognised her, and made her to stay in “one place where they were keeping everybody that they suspected.” The columnist said the security agents refused her demand to leave, adding that she had reported the incident to a police station in Abuja. Tweeting later on Sunday, she said: “I’m aware of the info abt my arrest at COZA today. I wasn’t arrested. Earlier, I sent out an image bcos I was concerned when pulled aside by the protocol dept for questioning. Thanks to everyone who has been concerned about me. I am sorry for all the misinformation out there.” I'm aware of the info abt my arrest at COZA today. I wasn't arrested.
