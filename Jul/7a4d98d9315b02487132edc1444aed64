Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has made a jibe at a former presidential candidate and former education minister, Oby Ezekwesili. A Twitter user, Christopher Okagbare, had on Sunday queried the presidential spokesman for being silent on several attacks launched at President Muhammadu Buhari by Mrs Ezekwesili. “Dear @GarShehu, Oby (Ezekwesili) has lately attacked the President at so many fora and you not reacting. Why?” Mr Okagbare asked. In response, Mr Shehu asked: “What is Oby?” Source : qed.ng
