A disaster!”I don’t know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool. Tell him the USA now has the best Economy & Military anywhere in the World, by far…and they are both only getting bigger, better and stronger…Thank you, Mr. President!” Number 10 previously called the leak “unfortunate” and said the UK and US still shared a “special and enduring” relationship.
