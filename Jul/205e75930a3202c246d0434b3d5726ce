Abuja (Sundiata Post)
–  A Chieftain of the All Progressives
Congress(APC) and National Organising Secretary from the South-East
geopolitical zone, Barr. Emma Ibediro, Tuesday said that Igbo presidency is not
a right. Ibediro said this in
Abuja during an interview with journalists, adding that Igbo presidency will
only exist when stakeholders from the region cooperate with the party to
convince the rest of Nigerians. He said: “Igbo presidency
is not a right; just like Hausa presidency is not a right. Yoruba presidency is
not a right. Igbo presidency can only become possible if you work within the
party and convince the rest of Nigerians to produce a Nigerian President of
Igbo extraction. “So, if the people
from the South-east are aspiring to become Nigeria’s president, I think the
first thing to do is to work within the party, to get the rest now, I don’t
think we are playing good politics. “It is a question of
give and take. I’m an Igbo man and I need to be very objective. The president
campaigned in all the five states of the South-east, just like he campaigned in
every other state. But what was the return in terms of votes. So, you also need
to encourage people to do something for you. You cannot at every point be
asking for something without giving something back. “Remember, if you
check the percentage of the population of members of APC and check the
population of Nigerians, you will see that we are even less than five per cent.
So, we are talking about a president that will be a president of Nigeria, not a
president of APC.”
