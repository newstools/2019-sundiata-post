By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Former Aviation minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has dared the Coalition of Northern Youths over their threat to evict all southerners in the north, saying that the 30- day ultimatum is too long and that the sooner the dance begins the better. Recall that shortly after the Federal Government suspended the Ruga initiative following the widespread criticism it generated, the Coalition of Northern Youth threatened to evict all southerners in the north within 30 days if the Federal Government fails to rescind its suspension of the Ruga settlements. Uncomfortable with the news of its suspension, the northern youths purportedly issued a 30-day ultimatum to every southerner residing in the north to vacate if Ruga is not implemented. Reacting to
purported threat by the youths, Fani-Kayode warned the group that the south was
ready for them and even charged them to save the 30 days grace it had given and
carry out their threat immediately. Fani-Kayode who
took to his Twitter handle on Friday,  said a 30-day period was too long, adding that
“the sooner the dance begins the better, while warning the group they will
‘reap the whirlwind that you have sown.’ “To the arewa
youths who dared to say that every southerner must leave the north within 30
days unless RUGA is implemented. “I say, stop
the threats and just do it! the sooner this dance begins the better! 30 days is
too long! you will reap the whirlwind that you have sown! “We are waiting
for you! this time around we are ready. there will be no settlement and there
will be no turning back! “Macbeth said
‘I shall fight till the flesh be hacked from my bones and damned be he who
first cries hold! “Between us, I
say damned be he who first cries hold!”
