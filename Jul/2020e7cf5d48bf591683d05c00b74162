By Joe Shelton Thick” isn’t the issue. But there are five things about clouds that are inissues and affect the aircraft in different ways. But the good news is that clouds on their own not only typically aren’t dangerous, but are fun to fly through… As an aside, I’ve done skydiving freefalls at about 120 mph through clouds and the only thing different than a normal freefall was not being able to see very far and getting a little damp from the clouds’ moisture. If I’d have my eyes closed I wouldn’t have been able to tell the difference between a normal clear air freefall and falling through a cloud. Source: Quora
