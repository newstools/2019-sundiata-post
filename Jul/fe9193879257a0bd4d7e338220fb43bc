Irrespective of all the drama and tension that has saturated the Pepper dem house, all thanks to Big Brother and his eviction news, some housemates still feel the need to bond in more ways than one. The latest couple Khaffi and Gedoni were seen under the sheets wrapped up and feeling cosy with each other and Twitter couldnâ€™t help but raise an alarm. We all know Gedoni and fellow housemate Kimoprah were once an item but in the house, they are more like strangers. I wonder how each party feels when they see their ex all loved up with another housemate?
