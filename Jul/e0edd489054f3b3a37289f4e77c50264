Stockholm – Swedish prosecutors on Friday asked to keep U.S. rapper A$AP Rocky in custody for six more days while they investigate him for aggravated assault over a street fight in Stockholm. “We … now need until Thursday next week to be able to finish the preliminary investigation,” Daniel Suneson, the prosecutor now in charge of the case, said in a statement, declining to comment further. The 30-year-old performer, producer and model, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was detained on July 3 along with his bodyguard and two other members of his entourage in connection with a fight in a Stockholm city-centre street in the early hours of June 30. The artist has denied the assault accusation. Before his arrest, he uploaded videos to his Instagram account of an altercation with two men, saying they had followed him and his entourage and that he had not wanted any trouble. The bodyguard was released without charge while a judge on July 5 extended the detention of Mayers and his two other associates. The performer was in Stockholm for a concert, and has had to cancel several shows in his European tour.
