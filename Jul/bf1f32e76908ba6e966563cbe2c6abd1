By Nkiru Ifeajuna Lagos – Afrosoul musician, Teniade Olufisoye, on Friday called on up- and-coming artistes, particularly musicians, to create their own styles of music,that would distinguish them. Olufisoye said that  this was  the only way  for them to stand out  and be recognised in a competitive industry. She told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that  it had become imperative for  young artistes to be unique and  focus on their works. According to her,  it is equally important  for them to be well educated in the area of music, maintain high level of discipline and determination within the industry and in  their private lives. “Music takes a lot of practice; believing in oneself and patience to stand firm even when no one believes in you. “While waiting for breakthrough, it is important to play with other musicians. “Also, do not miss an opportunity of practising music in the company with others. “This will  give anyone a flowing and elevated style of playing and possession of what he or she does,’’ she said. The musician, also known as Teni,  urged young artistes to listen to , practice  with and perform all kinds of music anywhere and everywhere, while making any available space a concert stage, in order to gain more knowledge. She stressed on the need for them to  discover selves as singers and performing in various platforms before launching their singing career. “You need to take voice lessons, learn how to bring out the best in your voice; learn how to read music sheet; learn an instrument and do a lot of researches. “The objective of art is not only to become wealthy, but to become great artistes; and all other desirable accessories will fall in  place,’’ she said.
