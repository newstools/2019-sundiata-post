By Stellamaris Ashinze Lagos – The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has granted a three months extension for the conduct of the initial audit report by every data controller and processor. The Director-General of NITDA, Dr Isa Ali Pantami, said in a statement on Tuesday in Lagos that the extension period would lapse on Friday, Oct. 25, 2019. Pantami said Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) requires data controllers to submit an initial audit report within six months of issuance of the Regulation (which lapsed on July 25, 2019). Pantami said that several data controllers had appealed for an extension of time to meet this obligation. ‘’Therefore, NITDA is hereby granting a three-month extension for the conduct of the initial audit report for every data controller and processor. ‘’This extension period would lapse on Friday, Oct. 25, 2019. ‘’This extension of time for the purpose of audit filing does not limit NITDA’s right to investigate and enforce other allegations of breach made against any data controller or processor.. ‘’NITDA is pleased to note that stakeholders including other sector regulators, government, banks, industry groups, private sector players, among many others, have shown tremendous willingness toward compliance with the NDPR,’’ he said. Pantami said that NITDA held series of consultations with various industry and government stakeholders on the implementation of the NDPR. He said that the overwhelming consensus of all stakeholder groups was that the NDPR is an appropriate regulation that would help provide clarity for data controllers and processors. According to him, the clarity is on the rights of data subjects, basis of processing personal data and transfer of data outside Nigeria, among others. NITDA is a Federal Government Agency established by NITDA Act 2007 to implement the Nigerian information technology policy as well as coordinate general Information Technology development and regulation in the country.
