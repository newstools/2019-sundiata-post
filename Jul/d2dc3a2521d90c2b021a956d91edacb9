The Black Stars of Ghana on Monday night crashed out of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations holding in Egypt after losing to Tunisia in a Round of 16 penalty shootout. The match had ended one goal apiece during regular time while no other goals came during extra time. Tunisia had taken the lead via Khenissi in 73 minutes but Ghana had their hopes restored a minute into extra time when Bedoui headed into his own net for an own. In the ensuing penalty shootouts, the Tunisian goalie proved the hero by saving a kick to end the match 6-5. Tunisia will now meet the tournamentâ€™s surprise team Madagascar in the quarter-finals.
