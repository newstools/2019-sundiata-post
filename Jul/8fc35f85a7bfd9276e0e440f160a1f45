The Kaduna State House of Assembly has rejected Aliyu Jafaaru Abubakar, one of the commissioners nominated by the State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai. Abubakar was said to have been rejected for criticising governor el-Rufai on social media. According to the Speaker, Aminu Abdullahi Shagali, who presided over the screening of commissioner nominees, the nominee’s rejection, follow his criticism of the el-Rufai’s policy since 2017 on his Facebook handle. Shagali cited the issue of unqualified primary school teachers who could not pass primary four examinations. The Speaker said “In your (nominee) Facebook account, you said ‘there is nothing like making Kaduna State great again and that it is a deceptive cliche used by politicians to deceive the masses’ and ‘We will make Kaduna great at the appropriate time. It is a responsibility for those who are truly sincere not for those who are inherently sarcastic.’ You also said El-Rufai must learn to tackle issues with human face, and said you are ‘an advocate of change that goes to the root and cause not only the symptoms’ “You also said in the same post, ‘stop comparing me with El-Rufai who thinks he is more intelligent than intelligence itself’. Meanwhile, the House Committee Chairman on Media and Public Affairs, Alhaji Tanimu Musa, told journalists shortly after plenary that el-Rufai’s nominee was rejected following his criticism of the current All Progressives Congress administration in the state. “Jaafaru has been a critic of this administration on social media. Why did he want to work with the governor?” The House unanimously rejected the nominee after the Speaker had announced. Other nominees screened and confirmed were Mr. Thomas Gyang (Commissioner for Planning and Budget Commission), Hassan Usman Mahmud (Commissioner in the Governor’s Office for Riots, Damage, Rehabilitation and Resettlement), and Atiku Musa (Auditor for General Local Government).
