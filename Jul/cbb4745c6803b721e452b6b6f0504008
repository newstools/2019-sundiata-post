Super Eagles captain John Mikel Obi is set to miss the side’s Round of 16 game at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations due to a knee injury, Completesports.com reports. Mikel, who has just signed a two-year contract with Turkish Super Lig outfit, Trabzonspor copped the injury in Sunday’s 2-0 loss to the Barea of Madagascar. The former Chelsea midfielder missed a recovery training on Monday morning with a swelling in his knee and is now expected to be out for at least a week. Mikel has made two appearances for the Super Eagles at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt. His performances have however come under scrutiny due to his failure to make much impact in the two games. Mikel failed to complete 90 minutes in both matches and was left on the substitute bench in Nigeria’s second game against the Syli Nationale of Guinea. The Super Eagles are still waiting to know the identity of their second round opponent which could be arch rivals Ghana or next door neighbours, Benin Republic. Guinea-Bissau are also in contention for the Group C second position.
