I have been married for 25 years.“In 2018, I went to Clapham, London, and she took me to a room and told me about great testimonies in her life. Initially, I just considered those testimonies as one of those things men of God said. She told me that God said I would have my children. That there is nothing God cannot do. I believed her and I can tell you that I am a testimony today. I am proudly ‘the first Nigerian artiste to have triplets’.” The church shared a video of the singer’s testimony on its official Instagram page on Wednesday. Watch video below: Source
