ABUJA (Sundiata Post) – Socio-cultural groups in the country have been urged to work with the federal government and security agencies to contain insecurity in the country, rather than issuing statements that are capable of escalating the situation or inciting people to violence. The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) gave this advice in reaction to a press statement credited to the Yoruba socio-cultural group Afenifere, that those it described as killer herdsmen should leave the South-Western part of the country or risk reprisal attacks. In a statement signed by its Chairman and Secretary, Niyi Akinsiju and Cassidy Madueke respectively, the group noted “with utmost disappointment the utterances of Afenifere and other such groups on the security situation in the country, as they are capable of instigating chaos and violence. “First of all, as we have said before, it is wrong to ascribe criminality to a particular tribe or group of persons, as this is capable of exacerbating the situation. We want to remind Afenifere and others that criminality is not restricted to any group and security challenges are also prevalent in the most advanced countries of the world. ‘’We are of the firm belief that under the circumstances we find ourselves, that all well-meaning Nigerians, especially leaders of thought, ought to lend a helping hand to enable the federal government tackle the security problems holistically. ‘’Even in the midst of the security challenges, we are aware that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration has remained focussed at solving the problems whenever and wherever they occur.” The group noted that the Buhari administration has,  in a bid to improve the security of lives and property in the country, commenced the recruitment of 10,000 policemen as well as sending many of the serving police officers for training at home and abroad, all in a bid to improve their efficiency and productivity. ‘’We are therefore confident that the isolated cases of criminal attacks in the country, particularly the South West, is a passing phase and will fizzle out in no distant time.’’
