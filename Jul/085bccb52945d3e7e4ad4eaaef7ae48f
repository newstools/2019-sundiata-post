A video of lady alleging she was raped by T.B Joshua, founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, is currently trending on social media. Bisola Hephzi-bah Johnson, an activist, made the allegation when she joined protesters who marched to the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), Lagos. Busola, wife of Timi Dakolo, a singer, had accused Biodun Fatoyinbo, founder of COZA, of raping her when she was a teenager. Protesters had asked Fatoyinbo to step down until he is cleared of the allegations. Johnson said she was trapped in Joshua’s church for 14 years before “the Lord set me free”. “This is not the time for making up (stories), this is the time to address. I am talking on behalf of other girls that are still in the captivity of TB Joshua. 8 years old, 14 years old and 11 years old, they are still there,” she said. “Yes. I can say it because they have money, connections, they can put people down. Enough is enough, if he thinks I am lying, he can contest it in court.” “I was sexually molested by T.B Joshua. I was trapped in the synagogue for 14-years of my life. I spent my youth in the synagogue until God set me free. If not for God, I will not be here today and I have documented it in book form.” Below is the video:
