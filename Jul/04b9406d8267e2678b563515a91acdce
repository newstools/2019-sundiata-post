Nura Dahiru, an assistant superintendent of Nigeria Customs Service, on Monday promoted himself to the rank of deputy comptroller-general of Customs (DCG), claiming he was directed by President Muhammadu Buhari to assume the office of comptroller-general (CG). Sources at the Customs headquarters in Abuja told TheCable that Dahiru walked in Monday morning wearing the new rank, and went into the office of Hameed Ali, the comptroller general. “As he came in, officers were saluting him because he was wearing that rank,” one of the sources said. “Sometime in May, he had posted on Facebook that he had been directed by the president to take over from Hameed Ali, and today when we saw him in the new rank, we thought, indeed, he has been promoted and so directed by the president. He went inside the CG’s office, sat in the waiting room, expecting the CG to handover to him.”
