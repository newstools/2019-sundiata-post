A police officer from the Kubwa area of Abuja has been given the shock of his life after he took home a man he thought was a female prostitute from a club in the city. After being busted as a cross-dresser posing as a female prostitute to lure his victims, the man was forced to strip to display the stuffed fake body parts he had. Confessing while being interrogated, the cross-dresser revealed he only switches up his look at night. One of those interrogating him, promised to give him a job that can pay him N30,000 a month if only he promises to change – he however stated that people like the cross-dresser are only keen on making fast money, and don’t mind being violent about it with a victim.
