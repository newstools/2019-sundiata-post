By Charles Iwuoha ABAKALIKI –  Over 10,000 persons in Ebonyi State have applied for the positions of Commissioners, Senior Special Assistants (SSAs), Special Assistants (SAs), and other political positions in Governor Dave Umahi’s administration.This was disclosed by the Governor Wednesday while swearing-in his 22 newly appointed aides.He lamented that many people in the state were interested in ‘juicy’ political appointments rather than smaller ones like Technical Assistant (TA), Senior Technical Assistant (TSA) and Development Centre Coordinator.Umahi said that, unfortunately, in his next appointment of SAs and SSAs not up to 10% of the ones he made would be appointed.“I am told that we have over 10,000 applications for Commissioners, SAs, and SSAs. This is in fact troubling and doesn’t give me joy at all.“What is trending in Ebonyi State is no longer I want to be Coordinator, TA or STA. It is I want to be SSA or SA. Every Ebonyian wants to come as SA, as SSA. They don’t even know the meaning of SA or SSA and it is very unfortunate.“But let me make this bad news, if I am making more SSAs and SAs, it may not be up to 10% I have made, that is the bad story about it. It is my opinion that we should find something doing not just appointment,” he said.He said he will appoint commissioners last and regretted that most of those who served in his first administration, gossiped and worked against the administration. (News Express)
