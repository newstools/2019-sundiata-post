By Nicholas Stone The version of Brexit preferred by the Brexit party is not supported by more than half the voters. Recent anecdotal polling suggests growing or majority support for either another referendum or cancelling Brexit. Both rejected by the Brexit party. Indeed a recent online petition revoking Article 50 (cancelling Brexit) received more signatures than the Brexit Party received votes. The Brexit party should be viewed with suspicion. The party has no membership, no policies beyond the no-deal Brexit and no manifesto. Their unelected leader – Nigel Farage – cannot be removed. They receive funding in any currency via an offshore payment mechanism. Source: Quora
