We reported earlier about Senator Elisha Abbo harassing a shopkeeper in Abuja. The senator was carrying out this act alongside a police officer, which many assume to be in his escort. The video is now gaining attention on social media and a lot of Nigerians are reacting. See tweets below: All the adherents of #StatePolice shd watch our Senator #NotTooYoungToNak showcase his new-found powers on a hapless, young, female shop attendant & order @PoliceNG around. So, we get 36 State Police formations to add to this – imagine how many such clips we'd be watching daily?! pic.twitter.com/byNUdsstz5 I've been saying we need to pay attention to who we let into the National Assembly. Now look: a sitting senator caught on camera assaulting a woman. These are our "leaders".. our "lawmakers". Shame on us. Elisha Abbo should face the full wrath of the law:https://t.co/6XeHJ48mJF In the presence of a police officer, Nigerian Senator Elisha Abbo, representing Adamawa North Senatorial District, assaults sales staff in an adult toy store in Abuja. pic.twitter.com/ezDpecGetD She dared to ask him to 'take it easy'… I mean, "a WHOLE senator". Lol. It was how resigned she seemed to be to the assault that got to me. Like, she knew she couldn't do anything. How can we deal with an animal like this? God! https://t.co/QSlIMBBFN9
