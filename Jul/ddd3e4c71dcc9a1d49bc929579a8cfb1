Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ The Federal High Court in Jos has discharged Senator Danjuma Goje of the corruption charges filed against him. This followed the withdrawal of the corruption charges brought against the former Gombe State, Senator Danjuma Goje by federal government. This came after the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) applied for the withdrawal of the charges on Friday. It is widely believed that the decision of the government to drop charges against Goje is as a result of his withdrawal from the Senate Presidency race, which paved an easy victory for Senator Ahmed Lawan. The senator was charged by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for misappropriation N25 billion when he was Governor of Gombe State. Culled from Information Nigeria
