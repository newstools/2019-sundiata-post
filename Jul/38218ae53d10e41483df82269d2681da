After BBNaija 2019 housemate, Tacha failed to answer a question correctly yesterday during the live show hosted by Ebuka, she has now opened up to another housemate, Khafi about the mistake and ignorance on her part. Recall that Ebuka had during Sunday live eviction show, teased Tacha about being braggadocious and all-knowing about the BBNaija show and asked her state the ‘characteristics’ of a winner and its definiton. Unfortunately, Tacha didn’t come forward with the best reply and social media had a fun time making jokes out of the whole scenario. Confiding in Khafi after the live show ended, Tacha explained what Ebuka’s question meant and what the best response would have been. Tacha also admitted her ignorance during the discussion which goes further to debunk claims made by her die-hard fans that she deliberately evaded Ebuka’s question. Watch the video below: Source
