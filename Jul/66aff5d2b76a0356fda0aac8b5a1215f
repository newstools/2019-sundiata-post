A woman who broke into a shop before stealing snake and other items worth N360,000 has been caught. A 34-year old lady, Ayomide Oyewole, has landed in trouble after she burgled a shop at a popular market in Lagos, stole dried snake and was caught. Report has it that the incidence happened at the popular Igando Market in Alimosho Local Government area of Lagos. The Police at Igando Division alleged that the suspect, Ayomide, broke into the shop at night, stole the dried snake and fish belonging to one Mrs. Morenike Taiwo worth over N360,000 including other items. However, while she was escaping, she was caught by security men, who eventually handed her over to the Police for prosecution. The items she allegedly stole were recovered from her as exhibits for prosecution but later released to the owner on bond. After interrogation, the Police found her culpable and she was then charged before the Ejigbo Magistrate Court, where she pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, Supol Kenneth Asibor, asked the Court to give a date for hearing since she pleaded not guilty to enable the Police to prove that she actually committed the offense. Source
