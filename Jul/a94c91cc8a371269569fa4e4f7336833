By Isaac UkpojuKaru – The ActionAid Nigeria, an NGO, says it is training selected 30 journalists from Nasarawa and Kogi States on advanced conflict and sensitivity reporting to mitigate violent extremism.Mrs Ene Obi, the Country Director of ActionAid, said this at the opening of the 3-day training on Wednesday in Karu Local Government Area of Nasarawa State.She said the training was part of the organisation’s System and Structures Strengthening Approach Against Radicalisation to Violent Extremism (SARVE 2) project in Nasarawa and Kogi states.Represented by Mrs Funmilayo Oyefusi, Director, Organisational Effectiveness of ActionAid, Obi said the training, funded by Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF), was geared towards equipping journalists with the requisite knowledge on reporting conflicts.According to her, the SARVE 2 project being implemented across 24 communities in Nasarawa and Kogi states was aimed at strengthening the communities’ resilience to violent extremism through capacity building and economic empowerment.She noted that the media played a cardinal role in ensuring that all stakeholders give attention to issues of conflicts and peace building, hence the need for journalists to be properly equipped with the skills to report effectively.Mr Isine Ibanga, the resource person at the workshop, explained that every conflict has an underlying interest and for any journalist to effectively report such conflict, he must clearly understand the interest.Ibanga urged journalists reporting conflicts to always detach themselves from the stories and maintain objectivity and fairness to all parties.He stressed the need for journalists to focus on the positive angles from conflict rather than the negatives with the tendency of escalating the situation.He identified the different stages of conflicts as latent, emerging, manifest non-violent as well as violent conflicts.Ibanga pointed out that understanding these different stages of conflicts would always guide a journalist to generate story ideas focusing on issues and identified with the aim of resolving them.He also cautioned journalists on the choice of language in reporting conflicts, adding that inappropriate expression will rather escalate conflicts rather than resolve them.
