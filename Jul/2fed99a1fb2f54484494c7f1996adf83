Washington – U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned China against waiting out his first term in office to finalise any trade deal. Trump added that if he wins re-election in the November 2020 U.S. presidential contest, the outcome could be no agreement or a worse one. Trump said this in a post on Twitter, as the latest U.S-China trade talks began in Shanghai. “The problem with them waiting … is that if & when I win, the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now…or no deal at all,” Trump said. Trump said China appeared to be backing off on a pledge to buy U.S. agricultural products, which U.S. officials have said could be a goodwill gesture and part of any final pact. “China … was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now – no signs that they are doing so. “That is the problem with China, they just don’t come through,” Trump wrote in a series of tweets. U.S. and Chinese officials restarted negotiations after talks stalled in May in a bid to end a yearlong trade war marked by tit-for-tat tariffs, but must still resolve deep differences, keeping expectations for this week’s two-day meeting low.
