By Segun Giwa Akure – The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has sealed off nine erring filling stations in Ondo and Ekiti states for various offences. Anthony Onaji, Head of Operations, DPR, Ondo State, said the offences bordered on non-approval of gas skids from the agency and under-dispensing of the pumps, thus making consumers to pay more for smaller quantities. Onaji spoke with newsmen on Friday in Akure, after an inspection tour of some filling stations in Ondo and Ekiti states. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a gas station was sealed in Akure, while four filling stations were sealed in each of Ekiti and Ondo states. Onaji added that some of the filling stations did not even possess the required licensing to operate “because they are not registered with the DPR’’. “The affected filling stations had been earlier warned, but they did not heed the warning. What they have done is punishable under the law, so they will be made to bear the full weight of the law. “One of the filling stations was sealed because it is carrying a dual identity, which is also punishable under the law. The station has been fined and it is to pay N250, 000 to the Federal Government. “The agency will not allow indiscriminate location of gas stations because it is dangerous to lives and property. Therefore, we will continue to seal filling stations that operate without valid documents and the operation will extend to the remotest parts of the two states. “Our activities will serve as a deterrent to other stations that operate without appropriate licensing, as well as those who operate gas skids without proper approvals,’’ he said.
