By Habibu Harisu Sokoto – The Sokoto State Pilgrims Welfare Agency says no fewer than 3,300 intending pilgrims from the state will perform 2019 Hajj in Saudi Arabia. The Agency’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Yakubu Gidan-Igwai, disclosed this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Sokoto on Wednesday. Gidan-Igwai said the agency has concluded arrangements with relevant authorities to ensure a successful exercise. He said the first batch of pilgrims would depart from Gada Local Government in the state on Friday.
