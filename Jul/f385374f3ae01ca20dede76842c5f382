He stated that customer deposits followed the same trajectory with a four per cent growth, to ₦889.5 billion as at June 2019 from ₦857.6 billion in December 2018. “With our aggressive focus on recoveries and improving asset quality, the bank’s Non Performing Loan ratio has continued its downward trend, declining to 7.3 per cent from 8.1per cent as at Dec. 2018 ahead of full year 2019 guidance. “Improvement in asset quality has enabled us to grow our loan book optimally in the first half of 2019, positioning us with the ability to take on emerging opportunities in key sectors of the economy,” he added.
