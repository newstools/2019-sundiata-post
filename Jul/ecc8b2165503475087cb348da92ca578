Abuja (Sundiata Post) – CHAIRMAN, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Nasarawa State chapter, Alhaji Mahammad Huseni, has said that any governor who refuses to accept the Federal Government’s plan to build Ruga for Fulani in their states want the crises to continue. Huseni said this in an interview with newsmen in Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, stressing that Ruga project across the 36 states of the nation would surely cub incessant farmers/herders crises. He urged skeptic governors to join other colleagues by keying into the program for a lasting solution to the lingering crises in their states. “Any governor that does not want Ruga settlement in his state is a lover of crises and doesn’t want farmers/herders clashes to end in Nigeria, instead he likes it to continue in order to be collecting security votes from FG. “We are suggesting for Federal Government to penalise any governor who is not ready for the Ruga project in his state,” he stated. According to the chairman, the Fulani in Nasarawa State are fully prepared and in support of the FG’s plan for the implementation, pleading with other tribes who have negative thoughts for Ruga to have a change of mind toward it. The chairman thanked the State Governor, Engr. Abdulahi Sule for supporting the FG plan in the state.
