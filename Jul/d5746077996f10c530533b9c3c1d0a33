The lawless misogynistic brute, Senator Elisha Abbo, does not belong in any civilized company, let alone the senate. Men with power abuse women because they can and because society enables and excuses their crime. Men without power abuse women to make themselves feel important and to underscore their insecure masculinity. Men of different stripes satiate their illicit desires at the expense of women; they prove themselves by abusing vulnerable female interlocutors. Nigeria is a dangerous place to be a woman, period.
