Kano – A mere eight-year-old girl has been reportedly hacked to death after she got kidnapped in Kano state.  According to the family of Aisha Sani, who was kidnapped two weeks ago in Tudunwada quarters of Kano State by an unknown lady, was found dead yesterday. Aisha, who was abducted when they closed from an Islamiyya School with her siblings, was taken away by another lady who covered her face with veil and no formal communication was made with her parents for three days. A week later, a text message was said to have been sent to her parents; informing them that she was in good health and they should not be bothered. But two days ago, according to a family member, who did not want his name in print, the kidnappers demanded N200 million as ransom. The kidnappers further requested that the ransom should be given to her mother who would now take the money to them. After two weeks of intensified search, Aisha’s body was on Monday found, as she was hacked to death by her kidnappers. Her parents have since taken custody of her body for burial. When contacted, the state police command said they were investigating the matter and that whoever was behind the dastardly act would be fished out. Source
