By Mohammed Ahmed Kaigama Bauchi – Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has directed the State’s Head of Service (HoS) and Civil Service Commission, to fish out ghost workers and block leakages in the civil service. Mohammed issued the directive on Saturday in Bauchi at a ministerial briefing by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). The governor, who noted that most of the ghost workers were on the payrolls of  Local Government Councils, said non-adherence to due process by MDAs in the state had become a common practice. According to him, with the briefing he received from the MDA’s, he will now ensure effective implementation of his blueprint geared towards providing the required services and infrastructure to the people of the state. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that  MDA’s had briefed the governor on their activities in the last four years  as part of efforts to identify challenges affecting smooth operations.
