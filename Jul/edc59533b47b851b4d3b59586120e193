(Reuters) – Abu Bakarr Kabba, a former Sierra Leone Football Association official, has been banned for five years for accepting bribes, the sport’s governing body FIFA said on Friday. FIFA said Kabba was guilty of “having accepted and received bribes in relation to the manipulation of international matches, in violation of the FIFA Code of Ethics.” The adjudicatory chamber of the independent Ethics Committee has also fined Kabba 50,000 Swiss francs ($50,372). “The formal ethics proceedings against Mr Kabba were initiated on July 11, 2018 and stem from an extensive investigation into various international matches (attempted to be) manipulated for betting purposes by Mr Wilson Raj Perumal,” FIFA said in a statement. “This large-scale investigation was conducted by FIFA through its competent departments and in cooperation with the relevant stakeholders and authorities.” The ban on Kabba covers all football-related activities at national and international level and came into force on Friday. The investigation into convicted Singapore-based match fixer Perumal’s activities has already resulted in life bans for players and former officials. Earlier this week, former Botswana Football Association general secretary Mooketsi Kgotlele was handed a life ban in relation to the match-fixing probe. ($1 = 0.9926 Swiss francs)
