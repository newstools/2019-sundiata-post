Leila Marshy Well, I lived in Egypt about 25 years ago for three years as a student, and then I went back to visit twice. It is teeming with intelligent and industrious people, but this is my opinion why it is so stuck. I have not been back to Egypt since the Arab Spring (and probably wonâ€™t go as I have developed a stupid fear of flying) but my sense is that while a lot of forward movement quickly deteriorated, the chaos of those years has been good for a renewal of energy and analysis. It is a beautiful country full of vibrant and good-hearted people. I wish it the best. Source: Quora
