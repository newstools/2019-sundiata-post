By Blessing Odega Jos – Mr Gabriel Bako, the General Manager, Plateau Environmental Protection and Sanitation Agency (PEPSA) has reiterated ban on planting of tall crops in residential areas in Jos-Bukuru metropolis. Bako, who spoke in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Monday in Jos, said the law prohibiting planting of tall crops in residential areas in Jos-Bukuru metropolis was still in force. Bako said tall crops like maize served as breeding sites for vectors such as mosquitoes and rodents like rats that spread diseases. He said that with the commencement of the rains, it was  discovered that people had started planting such crops within their residence and they needed to stop to avoid prosecution. Bako also cautioned the public to desist from the act of dumping of waste indiscriminately, especially in drainages which could lead to flooding and outbreak of diseases such as cholera and other gastrointestinal diseases. He called the public to imbibe the culture of hygiene as preventive measures to diseases.
