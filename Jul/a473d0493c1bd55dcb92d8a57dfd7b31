Over the months, I have carefully refrained from writing on the petition of former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar challenging the re-election of Mohammadu Buhari even when I get regular updates virtually on daily basis from very reliable sources. The server saga has further exposed INEC to ridicule. The Commission knew it was LYING when it claimed it had no server. So, so funny. Now, Buhari, APC and their supporters may choose to play the ostrich and pretend all is well about the last election. But the Borno and Yobe results showed how tardy and stupid INEC and APC were in the way they went about rigging the last Presidential election. Perhaps, they should have taken tutorials from PDP. Especially, PDP of the Obasanjo era. Sunday February 24, a day after the election, a very reliable source very close to INEC headquarters in Abuja said these words to me on phone: “APC and Buhari should be bold enough to accept defeat. The election has been won and lost.” But INEC and the hawks in the Presidency had other ideas. So many things I can never mention here. But I am sure of one thing: ATIKU WILL PROVE HIS CASE AT THE TRIBUNAL. But it is a different thing if the judges will be bold enough to make history and upturn a presidential election victory. First of its kind in Africa. The one in Kenya only ordered a rerun. Therefore, I do not see that happening. And that is why I do not share the optimism of the Atiku-is-coming crowd. Pardon me if I am not making your day guys… Source: Facebook
