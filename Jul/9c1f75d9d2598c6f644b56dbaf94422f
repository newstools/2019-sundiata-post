Senator Elisha Abbo on Tuesday clashed with Senator Oluremi Tinubu on his appearance before a Senate ad-hoc committee. Senate President Ahmad Lawan had on July 3 set up a committee to investigate an incident of assault involving Mr Abbo and a woman at an adult toy shop in Abuja. The committee was to be headed by a former governor of Ebonyi State, Sam Egwu. Other members of the panel include Mrs Tinubu, Mathew Urhoghide, Stella Oduah, Dauda Aliu Jika, Sani Musa, and Danladi Sankara. On Tuesday, Abbo refused to swear an oath before the panel. He also refused to speak in the presence of journalists because the matter was in court. “Distinguished, you just joined us. We have a procedure and we are also under law. You don’t come in here and dictate to us what should be done,” Tinubu told Abbo, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) member. “You are on the other side now. You don’t tell us what to do…because we can suspend you,” she added. Visibly upset, Abbo said: “I will not sit here and listen to you threaten me with suspension. I am a senator like you. You cannot threaten me with suspension.” Journalists were later asked to leave for the meeting to continue off camera. Abbo was arraigned on Monday at Zuba Magistrate Court, Abuja on one count of assault which he denied. Source: Qed
