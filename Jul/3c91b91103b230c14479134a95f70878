Abuja
(Sundiata Post) – Imo State governor, Emeka Ihedioha,has taped ex-minister,
Prof Viola Onwuliri and 16 others to be members of his cabinet as commissioners. Prof. Viola Adaku Onwuliri who was one time minister of Foreign
Affairs made the list alongside the former deputy speaker of the Imo House of
Assembly, Chief Chuma Nnaji. Recall that Nnaji was running mate to Governor Ihedioha, when he
first ran for the governorship of the state in 2015. However, he was dropped
for Engr. Gerald Irona in 2019 and it is believed that his nomination, beside
competence, is a well-deserved reward for loyalty. Also on the
list is Dr. Vin Udokwu, a medical practitioner who was the Director General of
the Ihedioha campaign organisation and former Chief of Staff to then Governor
Chief Achike Udenwa. The list of
commissioner-nominees has two female in the persons of Prof. Onwuliri and Mrs.
Ibekwe Nkeiruka Imma. Others on the list include Reginald Ihebuzor, Barr Felix Ebiliekwe, Engr.
Benjamin Ekwueme, Prof. Joseph Uwaleke, Nicholas Amaefule, Barr Christopher
