ABUJA – In a bid to forestall the impending strike announced by workers of the Nigerian Postal service (NIPOST) over alleged accumulated unpaid allowances, its governing board has summoned the leadership of the union and the Post Master General for an emergency meeting in Abuja. The chairman of the governing board of NIPOST, Maimuna Yaya Abubakar in a statement Monday in Abuja, said the board has taken steps to wade into the matter as the nation could not afford to allow a critical service provider like the NIPOST to down tool. Maimuna Abubakar, who explained that no such issue of accumulated unpaid welfare allowances was officially brought to the knowledge of the board before now, appealed to the workers’ union to allow the governing board wade into the matter with a view to amicably resolving it. The emergency meeting is scheduled for 4pm, tomorrow (Tuesday) 16th July 2019 in the board room of Nipost headquarters, Abuja. It will be recalled that workers of the Nigerian Postal Services issued a notice over the weekend to commence strike on Wednesday over the refusal of management to pay the backlogs of three years welfare allowances. The directive to commence the strike was contained in a letter to the Postmaster-General of NIPOST, Bisi Adegbuyi, and entitled, ‘Refusal to pay backlog of welfare allowance: Notice of three days warning strike’, The letter was signed by the President-General of Senior Staff Association of Statutory Corporations and Government Owned Companies, Yunusa Muhammed; General Secretary of SSASCGOC, Ayo Olorunfemi; President of National Union of Postal and Telecommunications Employees, N. Buba and General Secretary, J. I. Enaku.
