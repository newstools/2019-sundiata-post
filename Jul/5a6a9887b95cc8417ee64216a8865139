•INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu ABUJA (Sundiata Post) – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Monday stunned the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja when in a dramatic turn, it failed to call any witness to defend the February 23 poll that produced President Muhammadu Buhari as winner.In spite of enormity of exhibits and 62 witnesses who testified for the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, the electoral body indicated that it would use the tribunal’s proceedings for its defence.Although INEC lead lawyer, Yunus Usman (SAN) did not categorically inform the tribunal that the electoral body has no defence to the allegations of series of malpractices that allegedly characterised the elections, the counsel merely said that part of the evidence adduced by Atiku and PDP as the two leading petitioners will be used to make its case.According to Usman, the electoral body is satisfied with the testimony of the petitioners’ witnesses under cross-examination, to the extent that the election was validly held.Yunus said calling on witnesses would amount to helping the petitioners do their case.“We cannot help them to do their case. All their witnesses confirmed our position about the conduct of the election,” Usman said.Meanwhile, the tribunal had adjourned to Tuesday  July 30 for President Buhari to open his defence.Following INEC’s decision not to call witnesses, Buhari’s lead lawyer, Wole Olaipekun (SAN) informed the tribunal that they are preparing to go on with their own case if given the go-ahead. In another development,  PEPT has altered the scheduled of proceedings in the hearing of the petition, reducing from six to three, the days within which parties are to file their final written addresses.Presiding Judge, Justice Mohammed Garba said, in view of time constraint, the court has decided to alter its earlier announced schedule.By the new amendment, the respondents are now allocated three days each to file their final written addresses at the close of evidence,while the petitioners will have three days from the day of service. The respondents are to have two days to file reply on point of law if necessary.
