By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Hon. Muktar Betara Aliyu (APC, Borno) has emerged the new chairman of the appropriation committee as the House Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila announced the composition of the chairmanship positions of standing committees of the House. The Speaker named the chairmen of the committees during plenary on Thursday. Sundiata Post recalls that Abdulmummin Jubrin who was the Chairman of the Gbaja/Wase Campaign Director-General, also held the appropriation committee chairman during the 8th senate before he was removed in a controversial circumstance. Muktar Betara Aliyu is lawmaker representing APC, Borno at the green chamber. Also Tunji Ojo emerged as chair of the NDDC committee and James Faleke as the new chairman of Finance committee. AbdulRasak Namdas is the new chairman of Committee on Army; the longest serving lawmaker, Nicholas Mutu is the chairman committee on Gas Resources; Oluwole Oke the new chairman of Committee on public accounts, while Land transport committee’s new chairman is Tajudeen Abbas. The list appears not to favour some lawmakers as several of them gathered in front of the Speaker in what appears like a protest gathering.
