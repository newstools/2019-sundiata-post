A lady who campaigned vigorously for President Muhammadu Buhari is in tears, heartbroken, has been crying bitterly since the release of President Buhari’s Ministerial nominees. The lady recalls how she campaigned with Senator Owan-Enoh only for Senator Owan-Enoh’s name to be missing from the list. She said the president gave the Cross River Ministerial position to a man who lives in Germany, and was in Germany during the campaign and election period. “I remember working for President Muhammadu Buhari, I worked so hard. It’s like taking a brand to where that brand is not wanted, campaigning for President Buhari in Cross River State was like a taboo., Senator John did everything, everything….” Watch the heartbreaking video: #MinisterialList: #BukkyOkangbe, Media Aide to Senator #JohnOwanEnoh, Governorship candidate for #CrossRiver State under APC during the just concluded 2019 election Cries over The List.
