Srinagar (Indian-controlled Kashmir) – A policeman serving as Personal Security Officer (PSO) of a pro-India Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader was shot dead by militants on Friday in the restive Indian-controlled Kashmir. The policeman was attacked in Bijbehara town in the Anantnag district, about 44 km south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir. “Militants today shot dead PSO of PDP leader Sajad Mufti at Baba Mohalla in Bijbehara,’’ a police official posted in Anantnag told Xinhua. “He was moved to Bijbehara Hospital but the doctors there declared him to have been brought dead.’’ According to police, the policeman was guarding the  mosque, where  Mufti had gone to offer  his Friday  congregational prayers. Mufti is a cousin of former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti and lives in Bijbehara. Reports said that the militants also snatched the service rifle of the slain policeman and escaped from the spot. However, police are yet to confirm the weapon snatching in the attack. So far, no militant outfit has claimed responsibility. Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan, is claimed by both in full. Since their independence from Britain, the two countries have fought three wars, two exclusively over Kashmir.
