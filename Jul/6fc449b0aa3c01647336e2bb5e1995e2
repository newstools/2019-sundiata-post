By Tolu Aiyegbusi Abuja – The National Cashew Association of Nigeria (NCAN) said on Wednesday that it was planning to digitise its operations, to make online trading in the commodity easier. NCAN’s newly elected President, Mr Ojo Ajanaku, said this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. He said the association was in partnership with Information Technology (IT) experts, to build a mobile App, which would make trading of cashew become very easy from any part of the world. “ The mobile App is in the pipeline; we are in talks with software experts to build a mobile application which would be called NCAN APP. “ When the APP is ready, it would list various stakeholders, farmers and what each one has to offer in terms of cashew. “ It would be a contact and interaction point for everyone in the cashew industry,’’ Ajanaku said. The president said the association was working hard to have a formidable online presence, where all activities of the body could be showcased. “ We are also re-working on our online imaging; we are revamping our NCAN website because for a long time, our presence has not been felt. “ Through our APP and website, farmers, sellers, all stakeholders in the cashew business will be able to interact and transact business. “ As a local or international buyer, you can be properly guided or informed on where and when, and from which seller you can purchase cashew. “ You can also know the price and transact genuine business with real members of the association,’’ he said. According to the president, having a good and functional online presence will attract would be investors into the business of cashew. Ajanaku said that all necessary information would be properly communicated to the public very soon. (NAN)
