An Army colonel, a captain and his four escorts, as well as driver, have been killed by rampaging Boko Haram insurgents between Mainok and Jakana along Damaturu/Maiduguri highway. Sources revealed the Colonel and his convoy ran into some fleeing insurgents after a heavy gunfire exchange with soldiers at Jakana in an attack that lasted for hours. A military source, who spoke with our correspondent on condition of anonymity, denied insinuations that it was an ambush. He said: “The Colonel with his escort was just unlucky to run into the insurgents on his way from Maiduguri to Damaturu without knowledge of the ongoing attack on the highway”.

The source also informed the insurgents were dealt a heavy blow as one of their gun trucks was burnt and several of them killed. Another source informed that two civilians were killed in the Jakana attack from stray bullets. Read Also: Borno emir returns home 5 years after displacement by Boko Haram
