Members of the cold, calculating, and conniving Buhari cabal have chosen Babagana Kingibe as Buhari’s successor. In the privacy of their conclaves, they snigger at perpetually drugged and pie-eyed Bola Tinubu who naively imagines that Buhari will hand over power to him. Watch Kingibe’s media appearances in the coming weeks, months, and years. Of course, the cabal isn’t banking on any legitimate election to get Kingibe in power; INEC will just pluck imaginary figures from the air, ignore actual votes, and declare him “winner”–like it did Buhari this year. Nevertheless, I predict that should Buhari survive till 2023, he won’t hand over power to anyone, including Kingibe. Apart from his hopeless love of power for the hell of it, Buhari needs power to stay alive. The obscene amount of money Nigeria habitually fritters away to keep him alive, including periodic blood transfusions, can only be sustained if he’s in power. He won’t get that sort of money outside power. These are really interesting times in Nigeria!
