By Ikechukwu Iweajunwa Owerri – The Chairman of the Imo Sports Commission, Fan Ndubuoke says the state government will do everything possible to revive the sports sector in the state. Ndubuoke disclosed this on Wednesday during his maiden briefing with the state chapter of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN). He said the commission has also set aside Nov. 28 and Nov. 29 for Imo Sports Summit, adding that the bid team for hosting the 21st edition of the National Sports Festival would be inaugurated during the summit. “For the first time, Imo will hold a sports summit to draw up a sports policy that will usher in a new road-map for sports development. “This summit will assemble notable stakeholders in Nigerian sporting activities, who will rub minds to proffer solution for a way forward and I believe that the country will borrow a leaf from the planed summit. “Gov. Emeka Ihedioha has reformed all facets of sports activities in the state, and this gave rise for the proposed bid to host the 21st Edition of National Sports Festival,’’ he said. Ndubuoke said the commission would organize a sports festival to identify athletes that would represent the state in 2020 National Sports Festival in Edo. He said the proposed state’s sports festival would help the commission to carry sports development to grassroots level and identify hidden talents. The chairman said frustration and poor motivation almost killed sporting activities in Imo before the intervention of the governor. “I have achieved a lot since becoming the executive chairman and I will serve the state to the best of my ability. “All our elite athletes have ran away from the state due to poor motivation but we are trying to bring them back because our governor has strong passion for sports development,’’ he said.
