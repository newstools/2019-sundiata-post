American Rapper Nicki Minaj has threatened to stop using Instagram if the App stops showing the likes she gets on her photos on the App. Earlier this week, Instagram’s CEO announced the company would begin testing a new feature that stops likes from showing up on certain accounts. Users will reportedly no longer be able to see how many users have liked a photo, unless they are the ones posting it themselves. Global rapping sensation Nicki, 36, who currently has 107 million followers on Instagram , took to Twitter to voice her frustration on the news. She told her 20.6 million followers that she would boycott the app following the new trial, writing: “I’m not posting on IG after this week cuz they removing the likes. Hmmmm what should I get into now? Think of all the time I’ll have with my new life.”Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri recently opened up about the initiative with Wired, saying that “it’s about young people.” He said: “The idea is to try to ‘depressurize’ Instagram, make it less of a competition and give people more space to focus on connecting with people that they love, things that inspire them.” Yet Nicki doesn’t appear to think this will makes the app any “better”. Nicki went on to blast the social media service’s decision online. She shared: “They took away your engagements in the first place by disrupting the algorithm. Then they boost it to show you how much better this new iPhone is.“I mean how much better this new IG feature is… Lemme guess, u don’t believe your iPhone messes up when the new iPhone comes out… Source
