By Ikenna Osuoha Abuja – Mr Ikenna Nwakamma, First Cochairman, The Coalition of Civil Societies on HIV/AIDS in Nigeria (TCOCSHAN) says counterpart funding by international donors in fight against HIV/AIDS is decreasing. Nwakamma told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Thursday that the decrease in funding would affect programmes toward curbing the spread of the scourge. He, therefore, urged government to take up the responsibility of fully funding initiatives to tackle the disease independently, including diagnosis, treatment and drugs supply. “The foreign donors, particularly in HIV, have given Nigeria enough time to take up their full responsibility in the fight against HIV. He said “from the time of emergency response, the U.S. Government continually pumped in money to deal with the HIV epidemic. while Global Fund and other donors also give their support.” According to him, the dwindling funding may be the donors’ way of winding off its assistance toward curbing the condition. The society cochairman, who expressed confidence in the National AIDS Indicator Survey (NAIIS) report indicating lower prevalence rate, reiterated the need for government to own up in the war against HIV/AIDS.(NAN)
