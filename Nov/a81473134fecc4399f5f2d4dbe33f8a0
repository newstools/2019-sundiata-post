Yemi Osinbajo’s media aide, Laolu Akande, tweeted that “a list circulating in the media on… so-called sacked presidential aides is not genuine and ought to be ignored.” Hours later, Buhari’s media aide, Garba Shehu, counter-tweeted that, “The Presidency wishes to confirm” that the list was genuine and that it was “not personal or targeted to undermine the Vice President’s office.” Yet they both insist that there’s “no rift” between Buhari and Osinbajo! The Buhari regime obviously needs its own English dictionary to accommodate the unending schizophrenic quirks in the usage of English words by its propaganda honchos. Even when you do your darndest to keep Nigeria’s official idiocy out of your life for your own sanity, it keeps coming at you with pigheaded insistence. Source: Facebook
