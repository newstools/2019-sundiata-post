According to her, they also gave people in the community paracetamol, malaria drugs and mama kit for women who deliver their babies at home. Abubakar said other items distributed included antiseptics, mosquito nets and multivitamins. The president said Rotary has passion for helping the less privileged, adding that the club had adopted the Gidan-Gimba community for over three years. She called on Nigerians to reach out to the vulnerable as a way of serving humanity. A Past Assistant Governor, District 9125, Rotarian Evelyn Onyilo, said part of their mandate was to impact on communities “because we know there are challenges like health, poverty and lack of basic amenities.” Onyilo said the club gave health lectures on hygiene, clean environment among others. Alhaji Danjuma Audi, the village head of Gidan-Gimba, said the club members had done a lot for his community. He advised other Nigerians to extend a hand of kindness to the less privileged in the society.
