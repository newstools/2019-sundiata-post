By Stellamaris Ashinze Lagos – Mrs Funke Opeke, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), MainOne, a broadband infrastructure company, says the development of the nation’s digital economy lies on extending affordable broadband. Opeke said on Wednesday in Lagos that the development of a nation’s digital economy lied on the encouragement of innovation hubs, skills development and job creation. She said that the broadband penetration and affordability would improve the digital economy as well as provide employment opportunities. Opeke added that technology founders, innovators and investors across Nigeria and beyond discussed issues focused on deepening broadband access, affordability and youth employment. According to her, in this digital age where broadband connectivity is the bedrock of a thriving digital and national economy, there is need to focus on increasing access to broadband penetration. “The broadband penetration should be beyond Lagos and Abuja for our shared economic prosperity, job creation and digital security. “We will need to take advantage of the opportunities the digital economy provides if we are to create jobs for Nigerian youths in the not-too-distant future. “There is need to inspire a generation of young founders, innovators and youths to build scalable and investable businesses across the South-South and South-East states to accelerate development, ‘’ she said in a statement. Opeke, however, urged states across Nigeria to see the significance of broadband penetration and pay attention to enabling broadband in their regions. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Opeke had earlier presented a keynote speech at a programme in Uyo on the theme: “Unlocking the Next 60 Million: Making Broadband Accessible and Affordable”.
