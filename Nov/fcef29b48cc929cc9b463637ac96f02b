Popular Nigerian actress, Uche Elendu shares beautiful photos as she celebrates her first daughter, Chizzy on her 11th birthday. She wrote: “Happy Birthday my Sunshine, Adam, the love of my life, my clock that reminds me that time is ticking and I need to upgrade my game, not only do u remind me that I’m getting older, you also remind me that I am a STRONG WOMAN. Bringing you forth in pain and fighting unseen battles for your existence to manifest is a sure sign that God has a purpose for your life, seeing and watching you grow into a beautiful, dependent, strong, intelligent, smart and loving young lady gives me utmost joy and pride . I am BLESSED for God to choose ME to bring forth such a special child and for him to at his time rest the responsibility of bringing you up Solely on my shoulders hmmm Chizzy YOU ARE GREAT! In Jesus name, No man born of a woman can bring you down. You are unstoppable! The Grace and oil of greatness upon you is Rare! Nothing will stop its manifestation. Keep growing in Supernatural realm of blessings.
I love you my Child. Thanks for making 11 years of my life immersed in LOVE” See Photos: Source
