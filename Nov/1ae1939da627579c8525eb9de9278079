Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Bolivian President Evo Morales resigns amid turmoil caused by his re-election last month widely seen as fraudulent. His action is coming not long after his army chief urged him to step down amid protests stemming from his disputed re-election last month, reports the BBC. General Williams Kaliman told reporters on Sunday: “After analysing the conflicted domestic situation, we ask the president to resign his presidential mandate to allow for pacification and the maintaining of stability, for the good of our Bolivia.” He added that the military had ordered “operations in the air and on land to neutralise armed groups acting outside the law”
