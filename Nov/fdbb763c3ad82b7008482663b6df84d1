A couple in Central Nigeria, Wednesday threw colorful fanfare in a rare 50years belated wedding celebration. Mr. Mafai Mabas, 78 and his 68years-old wife, Udor joyfully walked down the isle in Mai Hakorin Gold village, 1km north of Plateau State University, Bokkos in an enviable celebration of love. The two have been married since 1972 but without any formality. They have had five children between ages 48 and 26, all married with kids. Although they have never had any major problems living together as a couple, the two decided to formalize their marriage to right their walk with God, a family relation told MK. The wedding officiated by Rev. Samson Adalu of Church of Christ in Nations (COCIN) Gold, drew guests from all works of life.
