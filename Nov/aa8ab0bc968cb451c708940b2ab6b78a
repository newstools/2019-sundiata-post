Ebonyi state – The sacking of two corps members of the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) in Ebonyi state for refusing to wear trousers given to them by the scheme has sparked a flurry of reactions on social media platforms.Ngozi Ukwuoma, the state NYSC spokesperson, had on Saturday disclosed how the two corps members were dismissed from the state’s orientation camp.Ukwuoma said when they were queried for not putting on the stipulated dressing code, they stated that such was “against their faith.”The incident has since generated lots of conversation on social media platforms where some Nigerians registered their different opinions.While a segment of users condemned the actions of the two corps members, stating that they should have been conversant with the rules of the scheme beforehand, others set a religious tone to the conversation, arguing if hijabs could be allowed, why not skirts?“Didn’t they read the terms and conditions of the NYSC before enrolling,” a Twitter user asked.“What’s good for the goose is good for the gander. If hijab should be permitted based on faith, their asking should be yielded to based on faith too,” another user said.Here is what some Nigerians had to say: Source
