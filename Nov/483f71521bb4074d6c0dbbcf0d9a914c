Following the closure of Nigeria’s border, smugglers have now found new ways of bringing in goods into the country. A typical case is that of a woman caught smuggling foreign rice using her bra and headtie. A video making rounds online captured the moment she was caught smuggling by security forces. There is no time stamp on the video, but in it, the woman was forced to remove the rice she hid in her bra and headtie by security operatives.
