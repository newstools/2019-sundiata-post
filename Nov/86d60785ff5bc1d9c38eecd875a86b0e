Ghana – Juliet Ibrahim is setting a rather strange resolution for her 2020 which does not really come as a surprise considering the actress is not quite known for her wittiness. The Ghanaian Nollywood actress was trying to express her desire to go international with her acting craft and basically on setting her sights on Hollywood as she has outgrown the local movie industry. Here is what Juliet Ibrahim wrote: “2020 is the year of not doing anything for free; not even masturbation”. Source
