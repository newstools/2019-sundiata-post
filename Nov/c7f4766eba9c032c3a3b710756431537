By Olayinka Owolewa Ilorin – Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara has renovated the decrepit hostels of the state’s National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) camp, barely five months after he described the facilities as not fit for human habitation. This was contained in a statement issued on Sunday in Ilorin by the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the Governor, Mr Rafiu Ajakaye. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the renovation came barely five months after the state government had supplied some items to the camp to make it more conducive more corps members. The items included 400 mattresses, 200 double-bunk beds, 100 long benches and consumables. AbdulRazaq had, on June 20, paid an unscheduled visit to the Yikpata, Edu Local Government area camp of the NYSC, where he lamented the state of the facilities which, he said, typified the deplorable state of things across the state. He, however, pledged to fix the facilities, especially the hostels, which he described as an eyesore. “We are really grateful to Mr Governor for keeping his words. I’m happy to inform you that the government has renovated the three main hostels, including the two-in-one Mayflower hostel. “I don’t think there is any NYSC camp in the country that has the kind of facilities we now have,” the state NYSC Coordinator, Esther Ikupolati was quoted to have said in the state. Ikupolati said that the camp management had decided to rename the Mayflower hostel as ‘Harmony Hostel’ in recognition of the governor’s efforts. AbdulRazaq had openly apologised to the corps members for the condition of the facilities, saying that the visit was a challenge to him to do things differently. “I apologise for the state of your accommodation. After seeing them, it is like a penitentiary. It is not fit for human living. “The people in charge before should have done better. By saying that, I have thrown a challenge at myself and my administration to make things better.” the governor said
