A Shari’a Court II, sitting at Magajin Gari, Kaduna, on Thursday dissolved the union between Sani Ahmad and Maryam Aliyu over irreconcilable differences. The Judge, Murtala Nasir, also ordered the complainant to refund the N45,000 dowry she received from the defendant since she was the one that initiated the divorce. Earlier, Maryam Aliyu, the complainant, a resident of Tudun Wada area of Kaduna, had told the court that she wanted a divorce through redemption (Khul’i). Maryam said she was ready to return the dowry she received from Ahmad. She, however, prayed the court to assist her in retrieving the N37,000 debt owed by the defendant, and another N8,000 outstanding balance of the child feeding allowance for the months of October and November. On his part, the defendant, who resides at same location with the complainant, said he had agreed with his wife’s demand, adding that he had divorced her twice in the past. The defendant also agreed that he owed the complainant the said amount. The judge ruled that the complainant should pay the N45,000 dowry in form of the N37,000 debt owed by the defendant and N8,000 feeding allowance of their children. He then dissolved the union. Source
