A 27-year old man, Kevin Williams, has landed in trouble in Lagos after he publicly disgraced a lady by engaging her in public fight, tearing her clothes, bra and stripping her completely naked over N200 debt. According to PM Express, the incident happened at Federal Bus Stop Gate in Ipaja area of Lagos, where Williams accosted the victim, Arike Olaogun. It was gathered that Williams owed the victim N200 for an undisclosed transaction and she demanded the money from him. Williams was said to have been angered by the demand; he reportedly grabbed her, rained blows on her and she became confused. He then tore her clothes including bra and then stripped her completely naked before their neighbours rescued and covered her nakedness. The matter was reported to the Police at Ipaja Division; Williams was arrested and detained at the station for investigation. During interrogation, he reportedly told the Police that the victim provoked him, which resulted in assaulting her but did not know that he tore her clothes and bra, which left her completely naked. The Police found him culpable and later charged him before the Ejigbo Magistrates Court for conduct likely to cause breach of public peace and assault on the victim. He pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, Supol Kenneth Asibor, asked the Court to fix a date for hearing since he pleaded not guilty to enable the Police to prove that he actually committed the offence. The Presiding Magistrate, Mr. T.O. Shomade, granted Williams bail in the sum of N100,000 with two sureties in like sum. He was remanded in prison custody pending when he will perfect his bail conditions. The matter was adjourned till 16th December , 2019.
