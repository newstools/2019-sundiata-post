JOHANNESBURG – A union that called a strike at South African Airways said on Sunday it was consulting with workers on a secondary strike across the industry after talks with the state-run carrier ended without a deal. “This secondary strike will have the impact of shutting down the entire aviation sector,” National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) spokeswoman Phakamile Hlubi-Majola told reporters. Consultations were underway with workers at organisations including the Civil Aviation Authority, Mango Airlines, SA Express, Airports Company South Africa and Comair, she said. (Reuters)
