•Governor Nasir el-Rufai Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna KADUNA – The Archbishop of Kaduna Province, Anglican Diocese, Buba Lamido, has   been  criticised by the   Zaria Anglican Diocese for  apologising  to Kaduna State Governor Nasir el-Rufai over the alleged plans to demolish  St. George’s Anglican Church, Sabon Gari, Zaria, by the state government. A statement by  the Special Adviser on Media and Communication to the Governor, Muyiwa Adekeye, had quoted the Archbishop to have  apologised to the governor “for the social media campaigns that tried to turn the issue of the redevelopment of Sabon-Garin Zaria  market into a religious matter”. The development didn’t go down well with the Bishop of the  Zaria Anglican Diocese, Abiodun  Ogunyemi, who chided  Lamido for apologising to el-Rufai. The  Christian Association of Nigeria in  the  state in September claimed that the state government was  planning  to demolish the 110-year-old  church for the redevelopment of Sabo Gari Market  and had  given  the church seven-day notice to  quit. Officials of the Kaduna State Urban Planning Development Agency in Zaria had claimed  the notice  came from the  governor. However, Ogunyemi said  the church in Zaria was not happy with Lamido for his  said apology. According to the cleric,  the Zaria Diocese  has dissociated  herself  from any form of apology to the governor. He said, “The Diocese of Zaria is not at war with the governor and we are not religious bigots. “We are only fighting for our right. Nobody can stop us from fighting for our right. “Besides, prophets do not apologise to kings but kings apologise to prophets. “Nobody can propose to demolish our cathedral and we will keep quiet or apologise.” (Punch)
