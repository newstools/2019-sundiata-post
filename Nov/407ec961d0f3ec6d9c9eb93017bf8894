A Las-Vegas hotel cleaner simply identified as ‘Jane’ has won a child support battle of two million dollars(700 Million Naira) off a young millionaire whom she never slept with but has a baby for. Narrating how it was possible during the court hearing, Jane said she stole the millionaire’s used condom from the garbage can in his hotel room after seeing his bank statement in his room during room service. She added that she then proceeded to impregnated herself with the semen because she desperately wanted a child at the time and she felt it was better to bear the child for a wealthy man. “He left his bank statement on the nightstand in his hotel room and I saw it when I was cleaning, at the time I wanted a baby so bad and I thought it would be better if I had a baby with a rich man” A paternity test was then conducted and the millionaire was found to be the real father of the baby. The court then ordered him to pay the woman $2 million for the 3 years of his son’s life he missed.
