Mogadishu – The  African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) said on Friday that a new police commissioner has  began security duties as part of stabilization efforts in the Horn of Africa nation. Augustine Kailie, assistant inspector general of police from Sierra Leone, is tasked with leading AMISOM police component to implement its mandate to train mentor, and advise the Somali Police Force (SPF) and support stabilisation efforts under the Somalia Transition Plan. The AU mission said in a statement issued in Mogadishu. Francisco Madeira, head of AMISOM, who met the new police commissioner, paid tribute to the Sierra Leone Police contingent for the excellence and professionalism in implementing the AMISOM mandate. “We have to help rebuild the police institution in Somalia, and ensure the delivery of quality services to the public,’’ said Madeira, who is also the special representative of the chairperson of the AU Commission in Somalia. The AU mission is implementing the transition plan, under which the mission will gradually hand over security responsibilities to Somali security forces and exit by 2021. On his part, Kailie noted that his appointment is an opportunity to reciprocate the support the international community provided Sierra Leone following the civil war from 1991 to 2002. “I am happy to pay back the support Sierra Leone received from various international organisations following the civil war. Their contributions were significant to our peace process,’’ he said. Kailie comes with 30 years of professional experience in the Sierra Leonean Police Force, where he has served in various capacities. Prior to his appointment as AMISOM police commissioner, he was the Head of the Operations Support Division, in the armed wing of the Sierra Leone Police Force. (Xinhua/NAN)
