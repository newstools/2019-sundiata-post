By Abujah Racheal Abuja – Dr Titilayo Banjoko, a Pediatrician based in Abuja, says nicotine exposure during pregnancy cancause complications in women, including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Bamijoko said this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Abuja. Nicotine is a stimulant and potent parasympathomimetic alkaloid produced in the nightshade family of plants.It is used for the treatment of tobacco use disorders as smoking cessation aid. SIDS, also known as cot death or crib death, is the sudden unexplained death of a child of less than one year of age,usually occurs during sleep. She urged mothers to stay smoke-free and also make sure their babies were safe to sleep. According to her, smoking can cause many problems that include birth defects or increased risk of SIDS. She added that “in 1960, medical doctors believed that smoking half a pack of cigarette a day wouldnot damage the fetus, but as a doctor of today I am saying that smoking cause more harm than good to a pregnant woman. “Secondary smoking can cause ear infection and asthma.” She stated that Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) include SIDS, accidental suffocation in a sleeping environment,and other deaths from unknown causes. She said it was usually more worrisome If the death was sudden and unexpected. According to her, there are a number of alleged causes of SIDS and ideas that people hold onto as they search foranswers, perhaps because the causes are never definitively known. Banjoku shared ways which mothers could take to protect their newborn from SIDS, advising that “when you have yourbaby and you are home, avoid things like tobacco or smoke around the baby. “I recommend that you use a new, aired mattress, not have anything bumpers, toys, mobiles, extra clothes or blanketsin baby’s cot; tuck baby at the bottom of the cot and have the cot in your room with your baby.” (NAN)
