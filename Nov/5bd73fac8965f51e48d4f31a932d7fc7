By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, on Sunday described former President Goodluck Jonathan as his political leader and said he served as a political strategist for the ex-president. Dickson also claimed he stood with Jonathan and never compromised during his failed re-election bid in 2015. He blamed “political jobbers for the purported rift between the
duo over the choice of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship
candidate in Bayelsa State. According to him, some individuals are sowing the seed of
discord between them by making misleading comments and misrepresenting his
actions to Jonathan. The governor, who stated these in a radio broadcast in Yenagoa,
the state capital, said those who claimed to be working for Jonathan did not
mean well for the former President. Dickson said: “I do not want to say much but those of them
sowing the seed of discord were not there when I fought battles for the former
President. “I told him during preparations for the 2015 election that the
election was our own and those who wanted to impose a successor on me are
unfair. “I will reveal more in my memoirs when I leave office and people
will have the details.” On the Bayelsa International Airport project, the governor
accused Nigeria’s aviation sector regulators of conspiracy and connivance with
the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the delay to grant regulatory approval
for the airport. He alleged that the APC was sabotaging the PDP developmental
efforts in Bayelsa.
