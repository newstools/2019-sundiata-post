The members who were charged to court by the FCT command of the Nigerian Police all entered a not guilty plea to the charges which border on homicide, disturbances of public peace and destruction of government properties. The protest which took place within the Central Business District of Abuja on July 22nd left a Deputy Commissioner of Police, Usman Umar and Precious Owolabi a corps member with Channels Television dead. The defendants who claim not to understand the English Language had the charges read to them in Hausa Language. The prosecution counsel, Simon Laounge urged the court to remand the defendants at the correctional yard of the Nigerian Prisons in Kuje having being held in custody by the special anti-robbery squad.
