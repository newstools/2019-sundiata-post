South Africa – South African singer and actor, Sjava has threatened to sue his ex-girlfriend and singer, Lady Zamar over allegation of sexual abuse passed off in tweets in which she accused him of lying about being single in over a year they dated. Lady Zamar said she was lied to, abused, both verbally and sexually, and also cheated on by Sjava whose friends also helped out in “hiding” his marriage. Sjava has however debunked the claim and further revealed that he is pursuing the matter through formal legal channels. “I am aware of the false allegations relating to abuse & assault contained in tweets by Yamikani Banda (Lady Zamar) on 29 October 2019 and the media articles based on those allegations. On the advice of my legal advisors, I am pursuing the matter through formal legal channels,” he tweeted. Source
