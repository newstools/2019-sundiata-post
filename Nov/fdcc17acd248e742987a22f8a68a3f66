By Eche Nwaobasi NNEWI – The Anambra State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has kicked against the establishment of Nigeria-Saudi Arabia Joint Islamic Council as one of the bilateral outcome of recent President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to Saudi Arabia. It said that they were wondering why such a delicate romance should be given prominence instead of serious issues that bothers on eradication of poverty, building of the nation’s economy and security. This is just as it described the recent apology tendered by some section of leaders of Miyeti Allah to the Benue State government as mere hypocrisy. Stating this in a statement released to newsmen in Nnewi last Monday, Rev John Ndubuisi, the chairman of the Christian body in Anambra State, stated that such arrangement cannot be a way forward for the nation to rise up to the anticipated development height adding that such issues should be suspended and replaced with discussions on strategic restructuring and revamping of our economy so as to give social leverage to the masses. The cleric said, “This type of delicate romance should not be the focal point; there are other important issues that demand serious attention such as how to build and grow a viable economy, eliminate poverty, address imbalance in the federal character principles, security, etc. “The issue of Fulani cattle herdsmen otherwise known as Myeti Allah should be addressed; there recent apology to Benue government is a mere hypocrisy; they should stop insisting on ruga settlements. We believe these issues should be given prominence instead of Joint Islamic Council.” (Independent)
