By Eugene Agha Gunmen, late on Saturday, abducted 13 crew members onboard MV BONITA, off the coast of Benin Republic. It was learnt that the gunmen took the crew members hostage from the bulk carrier MV Bonita in the morning of November 2 off Cotonou, Benin, according to the Norwegian shipowner J.J. Ugland. It was learnt that the gunmen boarded the anchored vessel while it was waiting for berth to discharge inbound cargo of gypsum, a mineral commonly used as fertiliser, destined for Benin. Sources revealed that the remaining crew notified local authorities and Norway-flagged MV Bonita docked at the port city of Cotonou later the same day, the company said in a statement. JJ Upland noted that its emergency response team was handling the situation as per contingency plans and that it was in contact with relevant authorities. “The families of the crew members have been contacted and will be kept informed by Ugland,” it added. (DailyTrust)
