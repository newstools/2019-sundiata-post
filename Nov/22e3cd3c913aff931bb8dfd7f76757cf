Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has vowed not to stop the group’s international diplomatic onslaught. Mr Kanu has been propagating IPOB’s agenda through Radio Biafra in London and visits to foreign parliaments. In a tweet on Thursday night, he said: “IPOB will continue the International diplomatic onslaught.” The group, which is supposedly seeking secession on behalf of the Igbo from Nigeria, had in August attacked former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu while on a visit to Nuremberg, Germany. Senator Ekweremadu was billed to give a keynote address at the Second Annual Cultural Festival and Convention organised by Ndi-Igbo Germany. He was, however, prevented from entering the venue of the gathering after being accused by IPOB members of conspiring with the Federal Government to proscribe the group in the South East and the killing of its followers.
