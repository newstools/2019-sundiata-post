Sundiata Post has reported that the CEO of Air Peace, Allen Onyema has been indicted in the US for money laundering and bank fraud. The news comes as a shock to many Nigerians, especially because Onyema was recently a subject of praise by many after offering his plane to evacuate Nigerians who were stranded in South Africa for free. See reactions below: Allen Onyemaâ€™s status as a wealthy businessman turned out to be a fraud. He corrupted the U.S. banking system, but his trail of deceit and trickery came to a skidding halt. The Allen Onyema, CEO of Air peace money laundering scam is elementary.Â¹* Sets up a sham company: Springfield Aviation LLCÂ²* Aviation LLC, receive funds in the USÂ³* Funds get transferred around under cover of buying airplanes.The question now is who does he launder for? Just when we are still celebrating our darling Allen Onyema, after his heroic rescue of Nigerians from Xenophobic South Africa, US Dept of Justice releases a damning report on allegations of fraud & money laundering totalling $20m by Air Peace CEO. Urrgh! https://t.co/XrP35EEMLb Why do I read vainglory in the Allen Onyema indictment document? Read this Allen Onyema indictment, I am not a lawyer but from the little I know, I think it's bogus.First they didn't say he stole anybody money.Second the monies were transfered from his accounts in Njgeria to his other business' account in the USA and used to buy planes. So two days ago, Joe Igbokwe, complained about Air peace barring him from flying because he criticised them and tonight we are seeing news of Chief Allen Onyema being a money launderer. ðŸ˜Š
