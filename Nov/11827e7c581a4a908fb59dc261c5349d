Carefully reading the indictment of Chief Allen Onyema, it seems that he exported to America the Nigerian way of doing business by cutting corners, cooking papers, and using shell companies to conceal self-dealing. That what is illegal is tacitly accepted as a way of conducting business and goes unpunished in Nigeria does not mean that you can do it in America. Onyema’s case is a mix of naïveté , audacity, and criminal recklessness. Source: Facebook
