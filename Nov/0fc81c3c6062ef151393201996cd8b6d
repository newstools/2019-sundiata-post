Under OBJ, UMY and GEJ, you never asked for FREE SPEECH and HUMAN RIGHTS to be sacrificed for some FAKE NATIONAL SECURITY. These charlatans, including Lai Mohammed, openly peddled fake news to irredeemably bring down the government of Jonathan.

ALL FOR EXPRESSING THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS. As God lives on His throne, any citizen promoting this, I say: WOE BETIDE HIM/HER AND ENTIRE GENERATION. And may the invocation of Lord Jesus Christ in Mathew 26, verse 24 be upon him: WOE BETIDE YOU IF YOU PREACH AGAINST FREE SPEECH!
