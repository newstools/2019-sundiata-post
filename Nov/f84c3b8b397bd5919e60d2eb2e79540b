By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has not minced words in telling all who care to listen that President Muhammadu Buhari will get all the support needed from the 9th National Assembly. Lawan on Friday reiterated that President Muhammadu Buhari will continue to receive the backing of the National Assembly in order to move the country forward. According to Lawan who spoke in Akure, the Ondo State capital while meeting with the state governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, the members of 9th National Assembly are ready to give their all to the growth of the country irrespective of their political leaning. Lawan alongside some principal officers of the Senate and the senators from the state were in the state to visit the ailing senator representing the Southern Senatorial district of the state, Nicholas Tofowomo. Recall that Tofowomo as well some chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party were involved in an auto crash two months ago. During a stopover at the Government House to also visit Governor Akeredolu who is equally recuperating from an undisclosed ailment, Lawan assured Nigerians that the 9th National Assembly would ensure a better country.
