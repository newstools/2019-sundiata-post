•Pastor Ize-Iyamu BENIN – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has excluded a former governorship candidate of the party, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu from its activities until further notice. It said the exclusion was informed by the unwillingness of Ize-Iyamu to confirm or refute his rumoured defection to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). A statement by the Publicity Secretary of the party, Chris Nehikhare, explained the expulsion will remain until Ize-Iyamu “acknowledges, accepts and addresses the issue of his decamping to APC.” The statement reads: “In the last few days, the Edo PDP has been inundated with calls and enquiries regarding the stories trending both in print and social media as it concerns one of our leaders, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. “The party leadership has patiently waited to hear or read his reaction to confirm or deny the stories, but to no avail. “We boast of being a party of men and women of integrity and high moral standing. It is a brand we have earned and wish to maintain. “As a result of the ‘uneasy quiet’ from our dear pastor and the impression our silence will send to our teeming supporters and followers, Edo PDP is left with no option but to announce the exclusion of Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu from all PDP-related activities with immediate effect, until he Acknowledges, Accepts and Addresses the issue of his decamping to APC. “This decision has been taken without prejudice!” (The Nation)
