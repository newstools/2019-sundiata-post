CAPE TOWN – Ghana’s Deputy Energy Minister Amin Adam said on Wednesday that domestic laws must be changed to allow companies already producing to further explore offshore areas for more oil. “We’re changing our law to allow companies that are already producing in a certain area to continue with exploration. We have in our laws provisions that constrain investment,” he said. (Reuters)
