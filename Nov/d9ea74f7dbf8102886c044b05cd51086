Giannina Maradona, the daughter of Diego Maradona has raised concerns about her father’s health after posting that the football legend is ‘getting killed from the inside’.The Argentine legend’s daughter, 30, took to social media to make the comments, writing: ‘He is not dying because his body has decided so, he is getting killed from the inside and does not realise it.‘I do not believe in the parameters of normal, but that is far from the reality of what he deserves. Pray for him. Please! Thank you!’Giannina, who was previously married to Manchester City star Sergio Aguero went on to say: ‘Do you remember there was a zoo that allowed you to take photographs with a giant lion?‘You could go inside the cage and just about ‘hug him’… They had him on pills, if not, it would be impossible to tame the beast. Anything similar to reality is pure coincidence.’In a final post, Giannina Maradona shared a throwback photo of her as a toddler holding hands with her father as they walked onto a pitch. In the caption, she wrote: ‘Give me your hand again, I can take you now!’ Explaining underneath the photo, she wrote ‘I share this with you because it is great being painted on a wall.’It has been claimed in several reports in Argentina that she is referring to her father who has publicly had recent health problems including knee surgery in July of this year.Maradona, 58, who is the current coach of Gimanisia La Plata has also had a long battle with drink and drugs in the past.
