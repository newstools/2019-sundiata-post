Argentina – Argentina legend Diego Maradona has denied living in a state of poor health while rubbishing the claims by his daughter he is dying slowly. The football legend’s daughter had expressed her concerns earlier as she claimed that his new job Gimnasia is slowly killing him from the inside. The legendary former Argentina attacker joined Gimnasia de La Plata last month after stepping down from Dorados in June, citing health reasons. In response to the claims of his daughter, Maradona stated that he is not dying and that he has been sleeping peacefully and has no idea as to what his daughter meant. “I’m not dying at all,” the former Boca Juniors star said in a video uploaded on social media, as per AS. “I sleep peacefully because I am working. I don’t know what Gianinna meant. I know that as one gets older people care more about what you will leave behind than about what you are doing.” Maradona then went on to confirm that he won’t be leaving behind any of his earnings to anyone and will instead donate everything to charity.“And I won’t … I tell everyone that I am not going to leave anything. I am going to donate it. Everything I earned in my life, I am going to donate.” Maradona is regarded as one of the greatest players to have ever played the game. Source
