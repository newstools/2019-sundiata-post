Lusaka – The Zambian government said on Thursday that it will have to take precautions before signing any protocols and treaties on migration. Minister of Home Affairs, Stephen Kampyongo, said Zambia will consult widely on protocols and treaties that have a capacity to undermine the country’s security and sovereignty. The minister said Zambia stands by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) regional bock’s position that threats to security and sovereignty of any country should be considered when signing such protocols. According to a release, the Zambian minister was speaking at a Ministerial Session for the 3rd Specialised Technical Committee meeting on Migration, Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons in Ethiopia. He said that issues related to migration affect Zambia directly as it was landlocked and mechanisms, especially on security have to be guaranteed before such protocols could be signed. (Xinhua/NAN)
