Abuja – The Committee of Youth on Mobilisation and Sensitisation (CYMS) has called on political parties to curb any action that could instigate violence in the Saturday polls in Kogi and Bayelsa States. The Director-General, CYMS, Mr Obinna Nwaka, made the call in statement on Friday in Lokoja, saying that the youths of both states should desist from any activities detrimental to their future. Nwaka also advised politicians to shun vote buying, saying that CYMS will not hesitate to report individuals or political parties that violate the rules to law enforcement agencies for immediate prosecution through its reports.He noted that the utterances and actions coming out of these states in relation to the governorship elections following the pre-election assessment was capable of causing problem in the states. He said that in a bid to promote good governance and ensure youth participation in electoral process the organisation had trained and  deployed young people as election observers in line with the INEC’s pre-election activities. He also called on the security personnel to take all necessary steps to mobilise strategically to counter political violence, paying particular attention to prevent or checkmate fake officials that could be used to disrupt electoral process. “The security should secure the environment from inflow of external forces with intention to rig or destroy the election and ensure effective non-partisan response that will prevent further erosion of confidence in our electoral process. “INEC should be firm and have a  consistent stance on the use of the card readers and uphold our electoral standards with quick respond where election materials are hijacked and diverted,” he said.Nwaka, therefore, encouraged all the electorate in the two states to turn out en masse and cast their votes for any candidates of their choice and support the INEC in ensuring free, fair and conclusive election.(NAN)
