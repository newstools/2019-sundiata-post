Nigerian musician and former member of the Psquare group, Paul Okoye has showed off the photo of his cute daughter wearing a black top and trouser with a neon stripe, showing her as a fire fighter. Nadia also carried a red helmet as she stood beside a red fire extinguisher, to fully get into the fire woman vibe. Despite wearing the fire department uniform, Nadia’s face did not break out in even a little smile and it is quite obvious that she means business. In the photo shared on Paul’s page, he wrote: “Who’s laughing with y’all”. In another photo, Nadia turned around to show off the FD written boldly on her back which obviously stands for fire department. In the caption of the photo, her father explained that she is the new member of the department. Source
