Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr has stated that his goal with the Nigerian national football team is to win the upcoming African Nations Cup in 2021. Rohr, who guided the Super Eagles to victory against Benin on Wednesday is out of contract in June 2020 but says his plan is to lead Nigeria to the summit of the African tournament rather than just qualify for it. Nigeria face Lesotho in it’s second match of AFCON 2021 qualifying this weekend and hope to make it a second win during this international football window. The Franco-German coach who once played for Bayern Munich led Nigeria to a second-round exit in the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia and a third-place finish in the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year. Speaking on his future plans, Rohr said; “It will be exciting for me to win the 2021 AFCON title with Nigeria. That’s my desire, and I will be the most excited.” “So winning against Benin is just the beginning. I can’t be excited until we win the title in 2021.” Reminiscing on the Super Eagles win over Benin, Rohr said to reporters; “The Super Eagles had a lot of scoring opportunities, but they failed to convert all of them.” “In the second half, we played a very good match, ‘one-touch two-touch’, and we have good wingers. We had a lot of opportunities, and with the changes we made, we did very well. It is good for us.” Source
