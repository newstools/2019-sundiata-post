The news media first reported that 35 Osinbajo aides had been fired by the “Presidency.” But his media aide said it was a lie. Then Garba Shehu, Buhari’s media aide, said it was true and added that the purge was part of a plan to cut the cost of governance. The sacked aides, however, said they weren’t paid by government; that they were seconded to Osinbajo’s office by donor agencies, thereby undercutting Shehu’s rationale for their firing. Finally, Buhari returned from London and said the sacked aides were only “redeployed” to other ministries and that we shouldn’t read any ethnic or political meaning to it. But how do you “redeploy” people to ministries who weren’t formally employed by government in the first place? This is a government by lies, lies, and more lies. Call it lieocracy, if you like.
