Jessica Onyegbula Abuja – The Chaplain, Christian Woman Organisation (CWO), Archdiocese of Abuja,  Rev. Kale Francis, on Saturday, urged mothers to live up to the task of motherhood towards building a great nation. Francis, who gave the charge at the “2019 Reunion and Christian Woman Organisation Directory Launch”, on Saturday in Abuja, said that woman as homemakers and potential nation builder must live an exemplary life worthy of emulation. He said that mothers should not be victims of societal pressure but should reflect on their lives, build a peaceful home and wake up to the tasks of motherhood for a great nation. He also urged mothers to create a balance between meeting up with social demands and serving God, adding that such could only be achieved by maintaining Christian virtues and living an upright life. ”Mothers should always reflect on their lives, build peaceful homes, exhibit humility and love in their relationships with their children and the society. “Mothers should build a healthy and peaceful home that will create a peaceful society; they should also place priorities on their homes,” he said. Mrs Mary Imaezue, President CWO, Archdiocese of Abuja, urged women to be better mothers and contribute to nation building. Imaezue advised mothers to always pray for their children and for the nation, especially in this difficult time, saying with prayers, the country would be revived. According to her, children are nurtured by mothers and mothers are also helpmates to their husbands. She, however, encouraged mothers to contribute to the nation by being faithful to God, their husbands and to their responsibilities at home. ”Nation building starts from the family, and we must play our parts by doing the right things at the right time. “In whatever we are doing, we must be truthful and serve God wholeheartedly,’’ she said.
