Nigerians have reacted with disgust to the leaked sex tape of two students alleged to be of Babcock University. The students were said to have had unprotected sex at the schoolâ€™s clinic. Babcock University is a private Christian co-educational university, owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The university is located at Ilishan-Remo equidistant between Ibadan and Lagos. A video of the studentsâ€™ sex session went viral on Wednesday with Nigerians on Twitter connecting the leaked tape to the escapades of former porn star, Mia Khalifa. It is, however, not known how the tape got to public space.
