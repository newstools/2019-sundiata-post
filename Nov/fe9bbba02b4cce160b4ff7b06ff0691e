An Ambrose Alli University lecturer, Mallam U. C. Aliu has been called out for physically assaulting two students over an incident. The students were left with marks on their faces after being slapped by the lecturer. The university’s National Association Of Students Activist has taken up the case in a letter saying: “`NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STUDENTS ACTIVIST CONDEMNS THE PHYSICAL HARASSMENT MELTED ON TIMINIMI DEBORAH AND OSAGHALE ROSEMARY BY MALLAM U.A.C ALIU OF THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT“` The Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma prides itself as a cosmopolitan University and over the years has maintained the status quo of excellence among her peers in Nigeria and the world at largeI now see the reason for the backwardness of my Nation, we blame those at the corridor of “power” forgetting those at the corridor of “education”; the corridor of “common sense “.I am a discussant of History and it has made me realise that from time immemorial, whenever there is problem in the society ,tertiary institutions are places of solace, they are citadels of solutions. Government would go to schools to consult undergraduates, lecturers; professors as they posed to be the backbone of the society. Now, Nigeria is in shambles, the economy is crumbling.That *MALLAM U. C. ALIU* of the English Department physically assaulted a student of the English Department. That *MALLAM U. C. ALIU* who happens to be in the *ASUU/STUDENT committee* who are poised at maintaining cordial relationships between Student and lecturer have since been harassing and placing fear in the mind of students who are ready to learn. *HOW THEN DO WE NOW CREATE A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH LECTURERS AND STUDENT?*In Line with the Student *Handbook and Degree 27* who guides both staffs and students it’s against the law to harass student on any ground but rather invoke the lawOn this ground we hereby call on the Student Union Government and management of the university to wave into the issue and find a long lasting solution to the subject matter above as its already becoming an habit and a day to day activities of lecturers who are suppose to be Friendly and not a *Conglomeration of Academic Ignorami.
