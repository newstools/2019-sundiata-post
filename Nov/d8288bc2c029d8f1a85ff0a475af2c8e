The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State has suspended the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, over his role in the crisis rocking the state chapter of the party. The decision is said to follow the vote of no confidence passed on Comrade Oshiomhole by the Chairmen of the APC in the 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Edo State. According to a statement this Tuesday night signed by Edo APC Chairman, Anselm Ojezua, and Assistant State Secretary, Ikuenobe Anthony, “Consequent on the development, the State Executive Committee has adopted the vote of no confidence passed on him and the subsisting suspension order from the organs of the party in the state.” The Edo APC leaders said the decision was necessary to prevent a repeat of what happened in Zamfara State, where the party was unable to field any candidate in elections. “Comrade Adams Oshiomhole is the one behind the crisis in Edo APC. We have passed a vote of no confidence on him and he stands suspended from the party. “We don’t want what happened in Zamfara State or other parts of the country to happen in Edo State,” they said in the statement, a copy of which was made available to News Express.
