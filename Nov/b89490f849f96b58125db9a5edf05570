He said that God told him that some popular Nigerians will be assassinated. According to him, “And I asked God what is this? And God said there is an attack coming after the music industry in Nigeria.“And I saw some popular people that were being assassinated in the music industry of the Nigerians.“With all due respect as the voice of God and the mouth-piece of the lord, this message needs to be carried to them and they have to be fortified in their prayer.“In the music industry of Nigeria, there’s a wind that is blowing demonically entering into the music industry.“Some of them are the bread-winners of their families, some of them will one day become transformers of peoples’ lives and we have to pray and preserve their lives.“I saw a list, to be honest with you, I saw a list, on the list I saw, I cannot mention all the names but I’m urging them to pray as a prophet of God with the eyes of an eagle that travels.“I saw a clear vision. If there’s any person called DJ Perez, DJ Spinal, DJ Blaze and others I pray for their lives. I pray for their destinies. The PSquares and whatever. I don’t know their names but I’m standing as a voice.”Watch the video below: Ghanaian prophet, Reindolph Oduro Gyebi predicts death for #DJSpinal, #DJBlaze #DJPerez and other #nigeriancelebrities .
