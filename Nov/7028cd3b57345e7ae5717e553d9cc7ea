The Football Association (FA) on Wednesday banned Manchester City midfielder, Bernardo Silva for one match after he posted a tweet on social media comparing teammate, Benjamin Mendy to a cartoon character in September. According to Sky Sports, the 25-year-old Portuguese international was also fined £50,000. This is coming a few days after Liverpool defeated Manchester City 3-1 in the Premier League last Sunday at Anfield. “Bernardo Silva has been suspended for one first-team competitive fixture, fined £50,000 and must complete face-to-face education after admitting a breach of FA Rule E3,” FA statement read. “The Manchester City midfielder’s social media activity on 22 September 2019 breached FA Rule E3(1), as it was insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute, and constituted an “Aggravated Breach”, which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it included reference, whether expressed or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin.” Source
