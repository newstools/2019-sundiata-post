Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Apostle Johnson Suleman President, Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide has considered standing as surety for Convener, #RevolutionNow, Mr. Omoyele Sowore. The apostle disclosed this on Monday on his official verified Twitter handle. He expressed concerns that though Sowore had hurt many people in the past — including Suleman himself — he is of the opinion that Sowore should not be allowed to “rot where he is.” He wrote:  “Am really worried that nobody is ready to stand surety for @YeleSowore.. yes he has hurt a lot of people, me inclusive. But do we focus on that and let his rot where he is wvwn if he caused it in a situation like this what will christ do?.am ‘considering’ standing bail for him”. Culled from Vanguard
