Personal assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on new media, Bashir Ahmad, has come under criticism for attributing the release of the kidnapped students of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria to police. Ahmad tweeted on Wednesday that the three students who were kidnapped on Monday along Abuja-Kaduna highway by unknown gunmen had been rescued by the police. The police said it took joint effort from security agencies to rescue the victims. “Due to the prompt response of the Police and other security agents to the scene, three people were later released by the hoodlums due to intensive combing within the general area,” police said in a statement. However, a relative of one of the kidnapped students, Sadiq Ango, said the police lied and that ransom was paid for the release of the students. Nigerians have criticised Ahmad for attributing the release to the police, saying it was all propaganda.
