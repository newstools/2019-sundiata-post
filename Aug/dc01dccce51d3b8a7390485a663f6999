The comment made by the Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, Mr Joe Igbokwe that anyone with the insinuation that President Muhammadu Buhari’s government has not done well is ‘a liar from the pit of hell’ has caused outrage on twitter. Igbokwe, who appeared as a guest on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Monday blamed the nation’s woes on the previous administrations since 1999. “You (PDP) were there for 16 years and we didn’t see anything. In the midst of plenty, I cannot lay my hands on anything. Support your leader, don’t be a distraction. Anybody who tells you Buhari is not doing well is a liar from the pit of hell given where we are coming from,” he said. Currently, Igbokwe is trending on twitter with Nigerians bashing him for such a ridiculous comment as many people have dubbed him a chameleon who’s only after his personal pocket. Read the reactions below: Two people I hope to one day engage on live television: this Joe Igbokwe man and Keyamo.Both of them need to be unmasked as political frauds who have sold their conscience for political leverage.Let the APC children reading this tell their daddies to keep avoiding this. https://t.co/702T96fGzp A few centuries ago, Igboland would have sold characters like Joe Igbokwe to a Drunk White Sailor. https://t.co/jVbMSUCFvY Gave up on Joe Igbokwe eons ago. After reading history books on mercenaries & their modus operandi, I learnt a different dimension to the power of money & it's propensity to treachery in men. One thing that became clear to me afterwards, is that mercenaries are NOT honorable men. Joe Igbokwe is not just a disgrace to the Igbo's and humanity in general but also colossal waste to even APC as a political platform. pic.twitter.com/0q7DebQS3w
