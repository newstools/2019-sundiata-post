Former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, yesterday, tackled the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, describing him as an ingrate. Ekweremadu who arrived Abuja to a rousing welcome by his supporters, also revealed that he was unruffled by the attack on him by members of IPOB in Nuremberg, Germany at the weekend. Ekweremadu advised Nigerians, including Igbo leaders, to feel free to travel to any part of the world they wished to, maintaining that the attitude of his assailants did not represent the dispositions and behaviour of Nigerians in the diaspora. “I think they were just people who were misdirected and misguided. I had the feeling they were under the influence of alcohol. They don’t represent the feelings of our people. There is nothing to worry about. The organisers, the Igbo in Germany, have written a letter apologising for what happened. Everybody is free to go anywhere because those ones don’t represent the behaviour of Nigerians abroad. “For me, I have moved on. The government and authorities of Germany are free to do whatever they wish about it.” He maintained that he had no regrets speaking for justice for Ndigbo and helping to facilitate Kanu’s release, insisting that he believed in justice for all irrespective of tribe, religion or region. “I have always spoken out on matters that concern Nigerians no matter where they come from. I believe in justice for all. It had nothing to do with IPOB,” he added. •Excerpted from a Daily Sun report.
