Luiz only signed a new two-year deal at Stamford Bridge in May but is said to have had a series of run-ins with the new Lampard regime over the summer. According to the BBC, David Luiz  will become an Arsenal player later today after Chelsea agreed to sell the 32-year-old for £8 million. Having struggled to make a deal for Juventus’ Daniele Rugani and with RB Leipzig’s Dayot Upamecano looking too expensive, reports surfaced yesterday of the club’s interest in the Brazil international as a cheaper alternative. Luiz only signed a new two-year deal at Stamford Bridge in May but is said to have had a series of run-ins with the new Lampard regime over the summer. It’s no secret that we need reinforcements in the centre of defence with Laurent Koscielny leaving, Rob Holding still working his way back from his ACL injury and Shkodran Mustafi’s form on the rocks. Luiz would at least bring experience. And hair. He brings a lot of hair. Edu obviously knows him from the Brazil set-up and Unai Emery worked with him at PSG for a few weeks before he was sold back to Chelsea in 2016. Admittedly, it feels like a bit of a panic buy, but at this point, it is what it is. Centre-backs don’t grow on trees. Luiz should arrive at London Colney for his medical this morning and the paperwork will need to be done by 5pm. Source
