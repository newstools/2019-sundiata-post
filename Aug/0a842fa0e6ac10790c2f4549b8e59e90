Some members of the Biafra Nations Youth League (BNYL) on Saturday reportedly engaged some Fulani herdsmen accused of terrorising inhabitants of Odukpani, in Cross River State, in a physical combat. BNYL leader Princewill Richard, who spoke with News Express on phone on Saturday afternoon, said that “the confrontation happened at Odukpani-Itu river side, leaving two herders and 20 cows dead.” He did not admit casualties on the side of BNYL and photos which he later e-mailed to News Express showed members of the group in a jubilant mood, with dead cows littering the environment.
