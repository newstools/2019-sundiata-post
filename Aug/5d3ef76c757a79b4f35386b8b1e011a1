By Dorcas Elusogbon Ifetedo (Osun) – An Ile-Ife Magistrates’ Court in Osun, on Friday, remanded one John Ashang, 26 in prison custody for allegedly parading himself as a cult member. The prosecutor, Insp James Obaletan, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Aug 1, around 8:20 a.m. along Omifunfun Road, Idera village, Ifetedo, Ife South Local Government Area of the state. Obaletan said that the defendant paraded himself as a member of Eiye Confraternity while unlawfully having in his possession, weeds suspected to be Indian hemp. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge of possession of Indian hemp and parading himself as a cult member. The defence counsel, Mr Sunday Olagbaju, pleaded for the bail of his client in the most liberal terms as he promised that his client would not jump bail. He also assured the court that his client would produce substantial sureties. Magistrate Olukunle Owolawi, however, did not grant bail to the defendant but ordered that he should be remanded in Ile-Ife prison custody. Owolawi adjourned the case until Aug 13 for hearing.
