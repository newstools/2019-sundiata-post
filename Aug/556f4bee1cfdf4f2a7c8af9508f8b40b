By Georgina Adegbie/Aderonke Ojo Abuja – The head coach of Nigeria’s national senior handball teams, Rafiu Salami, on Tuesday in Abuja said they have two medals in their focus at the 2019 African Games in Morocco. Salami told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that his teams were in good condition to target winning medals in both categories of the sport in Morocco. He said he was impressed with the teams’ performances at training ahead of the Games, adding “the teams are already in the quarter-finals psychologically. “We have been working together and basically I know we have performed well, because objectively they are prepared. “We have been working hard to make the country proud at the Games in Morocco. “So, I can assure that we will fight well to defeat all our opponents in our groups for us to qualify for the last round of the competition,” the coach said. He noted that his confidence was based on the extra knowledge he has of the teams, especially the women’s team. “Handball experts must have written the girls off, but I believe they can surprise Africa at the Games. I know how prepared our teams are. “I do not know how prepared our opponents are, but I know if they stick together they can do great. “And our goal is that we want to pick a medal in both categories,’’ Salami said. NAN reports that the 12th African Games will take place in Rabat, Morocco from Aug. 19 to Aug. 31.
