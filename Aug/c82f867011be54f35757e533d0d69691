The appointment of Joe Igbokwe as special adviser on drainage and water resources to the governor of Lagos state, has generated reactions on social media. Before his appointment, Igbokwe was the spokesman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Igbokwe had courted controversy earlier in the month when he said that anyone who claims President Muhammadu Buhari is not doing well is a liar from hell. Some of the commentators on social media mocked him on the new appointment which they claimed has belittled his status. Reno Omokri, ex-aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, described Igbokweâ€™s portfolio as an issue of poetic justice. May the poetic justice visited upon Joe Igbokwe fall on all those who know that General @MBuhari is a DISASTER but go on TV/Radio/Social Media to lie that he is a SUPERSTAR. Do you patriotic duty and RETWEET your AMEN! #AdviserOnGutterMatters#FreeLeahSharibu #RenosDarts pic.twitter.com/og01jmQ2f2 You denied your own flesh and blood just to be made executive abekpo to Governor @jidesanwoolu!

I just hope we will not hear that Governor Sanwaolu has directed Joe Igbokwe to represent him at a conference somewhere in Germany!#FreeLeahSharibu #RenosDarts I am not surprised that Governor @jidesanwoolu appointed Joe Igbokwe as Special Adviser on Drainage.
