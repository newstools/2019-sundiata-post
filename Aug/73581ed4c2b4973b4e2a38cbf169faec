Police now need Influencers. It appears this “influencer business” is not dying out soon. Social media is now the court. The same platforms they, sometimes, criticise, and hound people for. The platforms, for which they claimed the SARS killings were manufactured and exaggerated. They are on the same platforms seeking redress in the court of public opinion for their own loss. You see, injustice is no respecter of persons. Everyone will have their day. May the souls of those gallant officers rest in peace. Source: Facebook
