•IPOB Leader Nnamdi Kanu By Pamela Eboh, Awka The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has insisted that former Deputy Senate president, Ike Ekweremadu, was among some Igbo elites that played active role in the plot to assassinate him and kill the dream of an independent Biafra through Operation Python Dance, part one. Others include the President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief John Nnia Nwodo, Governors Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, Willie Obiano, Anambra, Okezie Ikpeazu, Abia State, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Enugu State and former governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State. He accused them of instigating, financing and defending a full-scale bloody military invasion of Biafraland which subsequently led to the torture and untimely death of over 600 Biafrans, out of which 28 fell in his compound. Kanu, who made the declaration in a statement made available to journalists on Tuesday in Awka by IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Comrade Emma Powerful, said: “These men sanctioned the desecration of the home of an Igbo tradition ruler by Fulani soldiers and did not care if my father, HRM Eze Israel Okwu Kanu, and my mother, who were home with me during the unprovoked invasion, is killed or not.” He further said: “All these desperate Igbo politicians ever wanted was my death, the death of IPOB, the death of our dream of freedom for all. “In view of the Nuremberg encounter, it has become necessary for us to refresh our memories lest it succumbs to confusion and deliberate misinformation because most people, unlike we IPOB, are in the habit of excusing intolerable evil and wickedness but we not. “Every perpetrator of evil, every purveyor of iniquity, every merchant of misery and every defender of injustice must and will be held to account. We will relent until justice is served.” Kanu recalled that the South-East Governors Forum held a meeting at Government House in Enugu over the increased tension in the region after what they termed Sunday’s clash between soldiers and members of the Indigenous People of Biafra. He observed that at the end of the meeting, which was also attended by then Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu and President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo John Nnia Nwodo, they arrived at eleven resolutions which include a ban on IPOB activities and an appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari to withdraw soldiers from the region. He said: “The Chairman of the South-East Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, read the resolution with Enugu Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi to his left and Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State to his right. “Below is the statement read by the Chairman of the South-East Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State Dave Umahi at the end of that meeting: ‘In view of the prevailing situation in the South East and its attendant consequences, the South-East governors hereby resolve as follows:‘All activities of IPOB are hereby proscribed.
