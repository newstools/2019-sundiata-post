Nigerian entertainer and activist, Charles Oputa, popularly called Charlyboy, is set to release a hit single featuring rapper Folarin Falana, popularly known as Falz. The 68-year-old grandfather, who released his debut high-life album over three decades ago, hinted at the ‘collabo’ in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Abuja. The “Nwata Miss” crooner said he has decided to work with Falz because of his philosophical style of music that addresses leadership issues and societal ills. He added that the project was an advocacy song targeted at driving positive narratives in society. “Falz is a young man that I so much believe in his music and passion for positive change in all aspects of our society, and we share similar thoughts. “We are working on something together and it will surely stir positive change in our lives as Nigerians.” The former president of Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria said that he decided to use music as a tool to inspire ordinary Nigerians, especially youths, towards holding leaders accountable. He explained that he was leading an advocacy and enlightenment campaign ‘Na we be Government” and decided to go back to music, his age-long passion, to call citizens to participate in nation-building. “All over the world, the arts, especially music, have been used to inspire people and change narratives towards a better society. “I did not go into music for money, but for the passion for it, and this time I am using it to awake the consciousness of all Nigerians towards building the country they desire.” (NAN)
