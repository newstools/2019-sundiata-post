The governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje, has alluded to his controversial victory in the 2019 governorship election in the state, joking boasting that he is the master of ‘inconclusive’. DAILY NIGERIAN reports that Mr Ganduje was declared winner in the March 23 rerun election after the governorship poll was declared inconclusive by Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC on March 11. The governor spoke on Monday while receiving Kano Pillars players and officials for trophy presentation in his office. Kano Pillars won the 2019 Aiteo Cup recently in Kaduna, breaking a 66-year jinx after defeating Niger Tornadoes 4-3 on penalties after regulation time ended in a goalless draw. “I knew Kano Pillars would win when the march reached ‘inconclusive’ stage,” he said to the laughter and applause of the audience. “As masters of inconclusivity, we finally made it. Because we have a composition of highly skilful and talented players.” Mr Ganduje then showered $1,000 (N360,000) each player and official, as a “preliminary gesture” for winning the Aiteo Cup. The governor, in a statement by his spokesman, Abba Anwar, said more bounties would come for the victorious team during the upcoming Award Dinner Night few days to come. “We are giving you this One Thousand Dollar ($1,000) to each and every player, with members of your technical committee. I think your number is forty (40). This is just one out of other gestures to come your way.” Source
