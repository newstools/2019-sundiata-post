Manchester United defender, Marcos Rojo, was left annoyed after his proposed move to Everton failed, SportsMail reports. The Argentina star has made only 18 appearances in the past two seasons and had been persuaded to leave Old Trafford. A loan was put in place, but United changed the parameters on Thursday morning and the deal collapsed. Everton had offloaded defender Matty Pennington to Hull on loan and let Mo Besic join Sheffield United for the season, with the the hope of landing Rojo. However, the Toffees did beat the deadline, to complete a dramatic late swoop to sign Alex Iwobi from Arsenal for £40million. Everton had failed with a £30m offer for attacking midfielder Iwobi on Wednesday.
