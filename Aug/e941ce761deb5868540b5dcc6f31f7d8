Many people have taken to social media to react after a video of secondary school girls twerking surfaced. A video of showing senior high school girls twerking in a competition in Ghana has surfaced online causing serious outrage. In the video, eight girls could be seen twerking vigorously and trying to outshine one another. Although they are not in uniform, it was gathered from commentaries on the video that they are some of the Free SHS students who are on vacation. Read some reactions on social media: *** Some ladies back then in SHS did similar and worst things. They weren’t fortunate to have smarts phones those days for the whole world to see what they were doing , but today social media is cheap and popular. The least thing u do gets a lot of attention. Its their time let them have fun but they should not forget the day of reckoning is coming.*** If u dnt be a bad gal or boy in shs then u won’t be a bad gal or boy again*** Social media negative side, is about time our government need to do something about it to control the negative side that children are being exposed to.*** They are the reason why I want to come to Ghana…I heard they make life easy koraaa .
