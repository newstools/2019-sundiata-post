The newly appointed Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has said he knows little about the policies and operations of his ministry, adding that all he knows about the ministry was what he read in the newspapers. He said this when he visited the ministry shortly after he was inaugurated and assigned a portfolio alongside others by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, on Wednesday. The former Osun State governor said, “I don’t really know much about the operations or policies of the ministry apart from stories about the ministry on the pages of newspapers. My relationship with the ministry is distant. What I know about the ministry is what I read in the newspapers.” Aregbesola instructed the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Georgina Ehuriah, who had been in charge since the dissolution of the last cabinet, to continue running the ministry until Monday when he would formally take over.
