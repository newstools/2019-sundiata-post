TUNIS – Alain Giresse has left his job as Tunisia coach after nine months in the role having guided them to the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations in July. The former France international’s departure was announced by the Tunisian Football Federation on Wednesday, who said in a brief statement that it was a mutual decision. Giresse was appointed in December and helped them reach the last four in Egypt despite them winning just one match at the tournament outside of a penalty shootout. They drew their three group games and needed a shootout to get past Ghana in the last 16 before beating Madagascar 3-0 in their quarter-final. They lost to Senegal in the semi-final after extra time and were also defeated by Nigeria in the third-place playoff. It was the fifth time the Frenchman has coached a country at the Cup of Nations after he led Gabon (2010), Mali (2012), Senegal (2015) and Mali again two years ago. The 67-year-old has also coached at club level in Morocco after two spells with Toulouse and a brief tenure in charge at Paris St Germain. Giresse’s departure means 13 of the 24 coaches from last month’s tournament have left their jobs. (Reuters)
