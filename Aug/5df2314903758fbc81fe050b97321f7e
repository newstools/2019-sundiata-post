A centenarian who has just celebrated her 107th birthday says avoiding men and marriage is the key to a long life. Louise Signore, from the Bronx in New York City, also credits her good health to a balanced diet and regular exercise. The senior citizen walks without a mobility aid, still does her own shopping and does not take any medication. She told WCBS: ‘I think the secret of 107: I never got married. I think that’s the secret. ‘My sister says, “I wish I never got married.”‘
Louise’s sister is 102 years-old, suggesting that marriage has done her health little harm, and that longevity runs in the family. The senior citizen celebrated her latest big birthday with a party at the Barlow Community Center in Coop City. It was attended by over 100 friends and family members, with Louise joking that she’d celebrated enough birthdays. She quipped: ‘I said I’ve had enough of parties.’ Despite her good humor, Louise, who was born July 1912 – three months after the Titanic sank – has suffered setbacks in recent years. She is legally blind, recently battled pneumonia, and survived an assault and robbery aged 103. Asked for advice on how to live a long and healthy live, Louise added: ‘If they have exercise, I do the exercise. If they have dancing, I dance. ‘I still a do a little dancing. After my lunch, I will play bingo, so I had a full day… ‘Italian food. Italian food is very good for you. ‘I was brought up with very good food. No soda, no cake.’ Alelia Murphy, 114, is currently America’s oldest woman. She lives in Harlem, where Louise was born. Source: Metro UK
