Lady Slaps boyfriend for refusing her proposal after dating her for 6 Years. | #Naijablogger. pic.twitter.com/gRYU7bRQ7r See social media reactions below: Bros is not smart, jeje say yes and later sort things out. Than all this yeye drama "just say yes…" On top slap? 🙄How did matters of confidence manage to escape the 4 walls of our home into the hexagonal mall?Westernized?🤷🏾‍♀️I just don't feel the public proposal vibe… 🙅🏾‍♀️In a freaking mall FCOL!Take risks. Yes. But calculated risks 🙄 Well, that slap may have explained why our guy didn't say yes. She may have been hurt by his refusal but a lady who is quick to raise her hands in that situation may be capable of doing more in secluded situations. In any case, this shit is foolishness. They won't understand that,not all relationships must end in marriage How can you date someone's daughter for 6 years without proposing to her? Even if she was studying Architecture or Law she would have graduated LMAO. https://t.co/gcrPrCAhuF
