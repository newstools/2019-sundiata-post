By Deborah Akpede Ikeja   –     Two businessmen, Okechukwu Ikechukwu and Jideofor Ofordile, were on Friday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, charged with defrauding two men of N530,000. Ikechukwu, 40, resident of Agbado, and Ofordile, 55 ,who lives at Abule-Egba, Lagos, however, pleaded innocence of the three-count charge of conspiracy, obtaining money under false pretences and stealing. According to the Prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde, the defendants committed the offences on Aug. 29, 2017 at Pen Cinema, Lagos. He said the defendants obtained N530,000 from Messrs Friday Orie and Charles Chinweze, under the pretext of allocating a lock-up shop to each of them. “The defendants collected N290,000 from Orie and N240,000 from Chinweze totalling N530,000. “When the complainants got to the shop, they discovered that the building, where the shops were located, had been marked for demolition by the Lagos State Government, due to road construction. “When the complainants demanded for their money, the defendants refused to give them. “This month of August made it two years since the defendants collected money from the complainants, which they refused to pay. “The complainants reported the case and the defendants were arrested,” the prosecutor said. Ayorinde said the alleged offences contravened Sections 287, 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 carries three years imprisonment for stealing, while Section 314 attracts 15 years for obtaining money under false pretext. The Magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N200,000 each, with two sureties each, as part of the bail conditions. Osunsanmi said that all the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. He adjourned the case until Sept. 23 for mention.
