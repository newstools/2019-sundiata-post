Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, (AAC) Omoyele Sowore, has been reportedly arrested by men of the Department of State Services, (DSS). Sowore was alleged to have been picked up at his apartment in the early hours of Saturday. The politician posted a distress tweet at exactly 1:25 am which reads, “DSS invades Sowore’s.” Later he added another tweet which could be a confirmation that his phone must have been seized while trying to raise the alarm about his arrest. Sowore’s arrest may not be unconnected with his recent parley with the leader of indigenous people of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. The DSS is yet to confirm the arrest. Culled from Daily Post
