Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Tacha has reacted to Enkay’s recent attitude towards fellow housemate, Cindy. Enkay on Monday rejected Cindy’s proposal to stay with her while they play Ludo game. According to her, she would rather scatter the game than let Cindy play with her. “I will leave you and still not play if you scatter the Ludo game, I want to play it alone.Cindy I don’t want to play with you, I’ll leave the game for you,” Enkay said. She also shouted at Cindy for using her slippers in the house. Her reaction raised eyebrows and did not go down well with some BBNaija fans who accused Enkay of looking down at Cindy. However, Cindy approached Tacha on Tuesday afternoon, complaining about Enkay’s attitude towards her. In response, Tacha advised Cindy to confront Enkay and tell her to stop complaining and looking down on her. She said, “Go and meet her and tell her your mind Cindy! “No faking in this house, everyone has equal rights.”
