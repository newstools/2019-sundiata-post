Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Khafi has emerged winner for this week’s Head of House, HoH, challenge for the ‘Pepper Dem’ edition. The position of HoH is usually assumed by the winner of the weekly task as instructed by Biggie. Last week, Esther was the Head of House for the second time. In today’s task, housemates were assigned BBNaija’s puzzle competition after the housemates were paired up for the challenge. Some housemates, after several attempts, fell behind in the course of the game, leaving Frodd, Seyi, Ike, Venita, Sir Dee, Khafi and Omashola to the final rounds of the puzzle challenge. Khafi however emerged winner as she got the puzzle correctly. According to Big Brother, the HoH gets the honour of sitting on the Head of House seat, 250 coins, as well as the luxury of a tastefully furnished Head of House bedroom. Khafi decided to share the luxury of the Head of House bedroom with fellow housemate, Tacha. Khafi’s emergence is coming just a day after Jackye and Gedoni got evicted. Source
