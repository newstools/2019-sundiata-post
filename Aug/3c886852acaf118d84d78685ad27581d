Tony Okafor, Awka The Priest in charge of St Joseph Catholic Church, Rev Fr. Vincent Nwokoye, in Achine, Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State led residents on Wednesday to protest the deplorable condition of roads in the area. Nwokoye said if nothing was done urgently the area would be eaten up by erosion. He said Achina, Onneh, Agbudu, Umuomaku, Ogboji and Enugwu-Umuonyia communities were on the verge of being submerged. The priest called for intervention by both the federal and state governments to save the church and the community from imminent danger. He said, “The erosion is so much that it is gradually encroaching into the church’s property, including the primary school and the parsonage. “Attendance to church services has also reduced drastically following the impassable condition of the road.” Another speaker, Otitochi Okeke, described the two roads connecting the communities as strategic for the evacuation of agricultural produce. He called on the state governor, Willie Obiano, to save the people of the area from threat to their lives and property. He said, “The Achina-Onneh-Agbudu-Ogboji Road which was awarded by your administration in 2014 is in a very deplorable state, with gullies developing at various points. “Also, the Ezira-Umuomaku-Enugwu-Umuonyia-Achina Road which you flagged off in 2015 is in dire need of attention as no work is ongoing at the site.” Source: Punch
