BBNaija housemate, Mercy was seen begging Ike not to leave after getting a strike. Mercy who wasn’t sure about her state when Ike leaves said she might be more aggressive. We recalled that Ike was given a strike for attempting to attack Seyi. She said:
“I don’t how i will be when you leave, I might be more aggressive or something. Please don’t leave”. WOULD IKE GET EVICTED?? See more photos below: Source
