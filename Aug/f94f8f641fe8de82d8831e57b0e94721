Beijing â€“ Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday that China and France would continue to collaborate with each other over Iran nuclear deal. Wang said this in a phone conversation with Emmanuel Bonne, diplomatic counsellor to French President Emmanuel Macron. After updating Wang on what efforts the French government has made on the Iran nuclear issue, Bonne said that France was willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with China. Bonne added that the cooperation would ease the current tension in the region, and sustain the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Wang said that China was in support of diplomatic efforts by the French side and was willing to provide necessary assistance. He added that China and France were both permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and thus carried important responsibilities for international peace and security. Wang added that the two sides should maintain coordination, firmly uphold the JCPOA, and safeguard multilateralism, the free trade system, fairness, and justice as well as regional security and stability.
