BBNaija housemate, Mercy was seen telling the housemates how seyi cant send her out of the house. Mercy also said no juju will send her out of the house as she plans on not talking to seyi till the end of the show. Seyi was sleeping while the conversation was going on among the housemate. We recalled that, BBNaija housemate, Seyi Awolowo, on Monday blasted Mercy, that no one in her generation has achieved anything close to what his family has achieved. She said:
“I want to see that power, i want to see that juju that will send me out of this place. I will not talk to him if he doesn’t come to me. Me and him will be like this till the end of this show. I want to see that juju, where they are picking it. The juju might have work for thelma but not for me. WAS SEYI WRONG?? See Photos: Watch video below: Source
