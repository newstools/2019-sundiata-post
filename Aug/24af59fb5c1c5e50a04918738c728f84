The official Twitter account of Nigeriaâ€™s vice president Prof Yemi Osinbajo is no longer available on Twitter. The usually active account with over 2 million Followers disappeared from the social media platform to the shock of many. The account @ProfOsinbajo when searched now is unverified and without a profile picture. A lot of Twitter users wondered what could have possibly gone wrong. I learnt Prof Yemi Osinbajoâ€™s Twitter handle has been experiencing some vicissitudes of late. From suspension to reversion to unverified, over accusation of vote buying through TraderMoni. @anticorruption ðŸ¤” I think Twitter suspended Pastor Osinbajoâ€™s account ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ It seems Osinbajo has finally left Twitter for you people. Meanwhile, his spokesman Laolu Akande has tweeted to inform that the Vice Presidentâ€™s account was being manipulated by hackers and that he has reached out to Twitter to resolve the matter. Yesterday, there were failed external attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Vice Presidentâ€™s Twitter Account. Since, we have been in contact with Twitter,  securing the account, and forestalling a reoccurrence. The VP will continue to actively communicate with our citizens.
