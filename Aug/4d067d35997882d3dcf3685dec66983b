Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC), has disclosed the condition under which election results can only be transmitted electronically. INEC’s Director
of Publicity, Oluwole Osaze-Uzzi disclosed that there might be a theoretical
transmission of election results electronically. Appearing on
Channel’s Television programme, Politics Today, Osaze-Uzzi said Nigerian law
does not support the theoretical transmission of election results. He insisted
that the electronic transmission of results was not immune to manipulation as
it can also be manipulated by those whose aim is to undermine results. The INEC
spokesperson stressed that the most important part of an election process was
the actual voting and direction of result. He said:
“Theoretically, in our elections, you can transmit the results electronically.
But the law in Nigeria does not allow for that. “If Nigerians want that to happen, then you can do that. But that does not mean it will not be susceptible to manipulation by people who are interested in manipulating the process. “That is the
building for the very foundation. If that is not right, others are not right.
Even if INEC gets the collation wrong which it should not, there is a process
by which, for example it is challenged, it goes back to the commission.” This is coming at a time when the 2019 Presidential candidate of
the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), Atiku Abubakar had claimed that results of
the last presidential poll were transmitted to INEC server electronically. But, this was
severally denied by the country’s electoral umpire which dared Atiku to provide
evidence backing up his allegation.
