By Chinyere Omeire Lagos – An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Monday remanded a 27-year-old unemployed man, Sunday Ademola, in prison custody for allegedly stealing two phones worth N410, 000 at cutlass-point from two pedestrians. Ademola, whose residential address was not given, is standing trial on a three-count charge bordering on conspiracy and armed robbery. The plea of the defendant was not taken. The Magistrate, Mr B.

Bakare adjourned the case until Sept. 17 for DPP’s legal advice. He, however, ordered that the defendant be remanded in prison for the period of 30 days pursuant to Section 264 (1) (2) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Lagos State. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Friday Mameh, told the court that the defendant committed the alleged offences on Aug. 23, at 11.00 p.m., at Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, Igbo Efon in Eti-Osa area of Lagos.
