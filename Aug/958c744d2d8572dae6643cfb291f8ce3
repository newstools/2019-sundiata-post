Enang is replaced with Omoworare Babajide, a former senator from Osun state, a source said. Mr Enang is being blamed for the not so cordial relationship between the Presidency and the Legislators in the first term. It is believed that he did not perform well in managing the relationship between President Buhari and senators in the eighth Senate ,according to a source. Mr Enang, a former senator from Akwa Ibom state, who was appointed special adviser to Mr President during the president’s first term, had continued to act in that capacity in Mr Buhari’s second term, even when his appointment, like that of several other aides, has not been renewed.
