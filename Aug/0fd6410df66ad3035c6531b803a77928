It was resolved that educational and examining organisations must consider exploring, developing, adapting and/or adopting various ICT based solutions to promote meaningful teaching and learning while enhancing their integrity, efficiency and effectiveness. “Innovations in assessment and education should be driven by research findings. “Therefore, education and assessment institutions must consider establishing well-resourced research units that will use appropriate methodologies, suitable statistical and qualitative analyses and provide information to support innovations,” it explained.
