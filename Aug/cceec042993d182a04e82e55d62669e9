•APC National Chairman, Comrade Oshiomhole ABUJA –  The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), has dismissed claim by the rearrested kidnap kingpin, Hamisu Wadume, that the ruling party gave him N13 million for the 2019 presidential election in which it’s candidate, President Muhammadu Buhari, was re-elected. The APC’s National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in his reaction to the trending story yesterday, challenged the kidnap kingpin to name the person who gave him the said money.

Unlike the period when the ruling party dipped hands into the public treasury to fund political campaigns and elections, APC had to rely on its own resources. “Even if we had all the money, we would never allocate money for kidnappers and murderers. That era ended with PDP. “Perhaps, he can name whoever gave him money. Definitely, it was not APC. From his purported confession, he claimed to be a PDP member before he went on to contest under another party,” said Issa-Onilu. (Daily Trust)
