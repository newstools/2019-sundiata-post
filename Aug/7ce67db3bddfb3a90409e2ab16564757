By Olayinka Owolewa Ilorin – Hon. Tunji Olawuyi, the member representing Ekiti, Isin, Irepodun and Oke-Ero Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, has called on the students he sponsored for the 2019 UTME examination to provide their results for admission and scholarship purposes. This was contained in a statement issued in Ilorin on Sunday by the lawmaker’s Senior Legislative Aide, Abdulganiyu Abdulsalam. Abdulsalami said those who fall into this category should submit their documents to Olawuyi’s constituency office in Omu-Aran, headquarters of Irepodun Local Government area of Kwara, on or before Wednesday. “We are asking the candidates that Hon. Olawuyi paid for their JAMB forms to come forward for possible assistance in admission and scholarship,” he said. He said those qualified for assistance must have met their institution’s cut off mark and must hail from the federal constituency. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Olawuyi had purchased UTME forms for no fewer than 1,000 student as part of his education initiatives in his constituency.
