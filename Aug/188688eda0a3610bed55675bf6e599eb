Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has given the club assurances, that he will not split the dressing room this season, the UK Mirror reports. Pogba has told manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, that he will be fully committed after a summer of transfer uncertainty. Solskjaer is now considering naming the Frenchman his captain, whenever Ashley Young is absent. The United boss was worried that Pogba could become a negative force at Old Trafford, after United refused to sell him to Real Madrid or Juventus. But the World Cup winner told his manager he respects the clubâ€™s refusal to sell him. He is expected to feature for the Red Devils, as they begin their Premier League campaign, with a home fixture against Chelsea on Sunday.
