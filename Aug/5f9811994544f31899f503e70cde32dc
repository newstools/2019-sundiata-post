A 56-year-old female pilgrim from Lagos State slumped and died while on her way to the Jamrat in the early hours of August 11.  The Lagos State Amirul Hajj, Dr AbdulLateef AbdulHakeem, has confirmed the death of a pilgrim from the state, who slumped and died early on Sunday. The deceased, identified as Alhaja Folashade Lawal, from Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State, died while heading to Jumarat to perform one of the Islamic rites, throwing pebbles at 3. a.m.“We were told she slumped on her way to Jamarat to throw pebbles but unfortunately she gave up from that point.“Doctors told us that she had high blood pressure,” AbdulHakeem told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Mina, Saudi Arabia. The amirul hajj could not immediately confirm if the 56-year-old woman was receiving medical attention before the incident. He disclosed, however, that all pilgrims from Lagos State made it to Arafat, saying that even a lady who had brain surgery was brought to Arafat in an ambulance to perform the religious obligation. “You know when death comes, there is nothing you can do. We always told them to be mindful of their medical situations and avoid whatever that will bring stress to them.“Islam is religion of peace and Allah has made things easy for us in the performance of hajj.
