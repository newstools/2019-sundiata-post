By Polycarp Auta Pankshin – Mr Yusuf Gagdi, member representing Pankshin, Kanke and Kanam constituency of Plateau, at the Federal House of Representatives, has advised farmers in the area and the state to desist from farming on water ways to avert flooding. Gagdi gave the advice on Wednesday when he visited Chip District of Pankshin Local Government Area and other communities where flood submerged some farmlands and washed away crops. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that some farmlands in seven communities in the district were recently submerged by flood. Though no life was lost, the flood washed away crops such as yam, maize, cassava, sugarcane and banana, from the affected farmlands. The lawmaker said said his visit was to access the level of damage done by the disaster, with a view to approaching relevant government agencies to provide succour. “I became worried by the ugly situation that occurred some weeks ago in this area and I decided to personally come to see things for myself. “If people have voted for you to represent them, you are duty bound to identify with them at all times, and seek possible ways of supporting them particularly in times of need. “Flood is a natural disaster, but people must take drastic steps in ensuring its aftermaths are minimised. “Though this is not an urban area, I still want to advice my people here to desist from farming on water ways; they should create channels for water to floor freely to avoid flooding,” he advised. The lawmaker promised to take up the matter with relevant agencies of government in order to attract support for the affected persons. He also donated some cash to the affected persons in order to cushion the effects of the disaster.
