By Aisha Gambo Kaduna – The Rotaract Club of Kaduna has urged residents of Sabo Community in Kaduna State to dispose their waste properly to prevent flooding and clean their surroundings to promote healthy environment. The club in collaboration with Renewable Energy and Environmental Sustainability (REES) made the appeal on Sunday when it took its sensitisation campaign and clean-up exercise to Sabo Community, Kaduna State. President of the club, Mr Daniel Abah, told newsmen that the campaign was aimed at creating awareness and showing residents of the community how to take care of their environment for sustainable development. “Regarding the issue of flooding which has affected several places, it is improper waste disposal that contributes to the menace,’’ he said. Abah said the sensitisation campaign and clean-up exercise were geared toward encouraging community residents on the need to properly manage waste in their households and outside. He said that the campaign would increase environment consciousness among residents and enlighten them on the effects of improper disposal of waste. Abah urged participants in the exercise to extend their knowledge of environmental cleanliness to their neighbours at home and work together to keep the environment clean. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that young men and women in the community participated in the cleaning exercise.
