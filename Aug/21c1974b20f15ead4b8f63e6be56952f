Embattled London policewoman, Khafi Kareem, has said that the only thing that makes her happy at the moment is the thought that Gedoni could propose to her on the last day of the Big Brother Naija 2019 show. The 29-year-old said this on Wednesday during a conversation with Omashola. “Day 99 Gedoni is going to be outside waiting for me with a ring in his hand asking me to marry him,” she said. Omashola interrupts “Not yet”, she then said: “It is unrealistic but that is what is making me happy right now.” Gedoni and Khafi had enjoyed romantic times together before his eviction on August 25. Gedoni, after his eviction, spoke with a vlogger about his relationship with Khafi. When asked to say what he wished he could tell Khafi at that moment, he said he was in love with her. The pair was filmed engaging in sex acts in the Big Brother Naija house severally. They were first shown in the act on Saturday, July 20th then again on Tuesday, July 23, and again on Monday, July 29. Qed.
