•Speaker Imo State House of Assembly, Chiji Collins By Okwudili Ndidi OWERRI – Fresh scandal is rocking the Imo State House of Assembly following the alleged forging of the signature of the Speaker of the House, Right Honourable Chiji Collins, by his Chief of Staff, Mike Ohaka, in a letter to the Vice Chancellor of the Imo State University, Professor Adaobi Obasi, requesting to employ 46 persons, whose names were contained in the letter. A reliable source close to the Speaker said the Vice Chancellor, on receipt of the letter, called the Speaker to complain that the University was not recruiting and could not employ the people he forwarded their names. According to the source, the bemused Speaker denied writing the controversial letter and insisted that he has not recommended anyone to the Vice Chancellor for employment. However, efforts to speak with the Vice Chancellor was abortive as she neither answered her phone nor replied the text message sent to her but the University’s Public Relations Officer, Ralph Njoku-Obi, said that such letters go direct to the vice chancellor and as such he was not aware of it. Meanwhile, when confronted with the issue, the Chief of Staff to the Speaker (Mike Ohaka), insisted that the said letter was signed by the Speaker. In his words, “Yes, the letter was signed by the Speaker but the number of names was not anything close to 46. The Speaker asked us to write the VC to assist a few people to get a job in the University and he was the one that signed the letter, I did not forge his signature.” But when contacted, the Speaker denied any knowledge of such a letter. He said, “I am not aware of any such letter and I didn’t direct anyone to write to the Imo State University or any other institution in the state for job placement. He should show a copy of the letter if he told you that there was a letter I signed.” (The Nation)
