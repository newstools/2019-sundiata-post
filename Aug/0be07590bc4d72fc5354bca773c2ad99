Abuja (Sundiata Post) – President Muhammadu Buhari has applauded the election of renowned Mass Communication lecturer, Professor Ralph Akinfeleye, into the World Journalism Education Council. The President, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, yesterday, said the Federal Government would always appreciate those who bring honour to the country, particularly in the areas of scholarship and other lofty endeavours. According to Buhari:“It is in that light that the President sees the recent election of foremost Mass Communication teacher, Prof Ralph A. Akinfeleye, into the World Journalism Education Council, the first African to achieve such feat.” He noted that the election of the University of Lagos Don in Paris, France, last week, “hoists Nigeria’s flag proudly once again in the international arena.” Buhari urged Akinfeleye to serve diligently in the three-year term, in which he would represent not only Nigeria, but the entire African continent. More than 600 participants from 70 countries participated in the World Journalism Education Congress, where Akinfeleye was elected.
