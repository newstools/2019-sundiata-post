According to New Telegraph, a yet to be identified corpse of a young lady was on Monday found around Grace Tower Church in the Nyiman area of Makurdi, the Benue State capital, after she was allegedly gang-raped to death. Indications that the lady was raped by her assailants rented the air as it was justified that she was found naked and dumped in a drainage and visible signs of a struggle were evident. Benue State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Catherine Anene, confirmed the recovery of the corpse in the early hours of Monday. DSP Anene explained that the cause of her death “remained unknown unless an autopsy was conducted”. She, however, denied that the victim was raped to death as speculated on the social media. Source
