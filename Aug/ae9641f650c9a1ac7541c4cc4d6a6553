Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ Barely a month after the Obafemi Awolowo
female hostel in University of Ibadan was invaded, robbers again invaded
Abdulsalam Abubakar Hall of the university in the early hours of Sunday and
injured two students. Robbers had
attacked Obafemi Awolowo hall on July 11, 2019 and injured female students. Our
correspondent gathered that the robbers who attacked only the female wing of
the Hall reportedly tied security man on duty to have their way. Two male
students who tried to obstruct their sinister mission received machete cuts and
have been treated at the University Health centre. The thieves
made away with phones and other valuables. Speaking on
the incident, Chairman Council Committee on Security, Professor Ademola Aremu
stated that the university is reviewing the security design. Aremu who
visited the hall in company of the Vice Chancellor Professor Idowu Olayinka
stated that the police are working hard to track the invaders. According to
him, the invaders have shown pattern in their operation by attacking female
students and invading during holidays when halls are sparsely populated.
