By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu – The Chairman of Civil Liberties Organisation in Anambra, Mr Vincent Ezekwueme, has expressed deep worry over the increasing spate of violent crimes in Nigeria.Speaking in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Enugu, Ezekwueme called for a national prayer for God’s intervention.He spoke against the backdrop of increasing cases of kidnap and Thursday’s gruesome murder of a Catholic Priest, Rev.-Fr. Paul Offu, in Enugu state.According to him, the security situation is become more despicable and scary on a daily basis.He said: “Nigerians do not need a fortune teller to know that the security situation in the country  has become too pathetic and despicable.“Concerted and selfless, patriotic and altruistic effort is not only needed but inevitable, if we must surmount the challenge.“The killing of Rev.-Fr. Offu on Aug. 1 and the abduction of five persons on the Lagos-Ore expressway on Aug. 2 were barbaric, horrendous, inhuman, despicable and detestable.“It is a complete negation of God’s injunction, which says, ‘touch not my anointed and do my prophet no harm.’’Ezekwueme also appealed to criminally-minded persons, groups and the perpetrators of insecurity in most parts of the country to change their hearts and denounce criminality.“I weep and lament for my country that some people take laws into their hands, decide and dictate who should live and who should not live.“Fortunately, every religion preaches and teaches the sanctity of human life, in tandem with God’s commandment that `Thou shall not kill’.“Before you become a Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Hinduist, Atheist or believer in any other religion, you are first of all human,’’ the rights activist said.He appealed to Nigerians to be humane, love one another and think about the common good and interest of all.He warned that the shedding of innocent blood had very severe consequences.
