Popular Nigerian Dancer, Korra Obidi cries out over the humiliation and harassment of a fellow dancer. A video was seen going viral yesterday of police harassing a dancer as they carried him and almost strangled him to death. Korra Obidi was really angry as she recounted her experience on how she was harassed and almost got extorted with her husband while they were filming in Nigeria. She said: “So i woke up this morning. Am really really vexed like am angry. Why would you treat a dancer that is trying to make a living, why would he be treated like that. During our visit in Nigeria, they wanted to take our cameras, they took us to one shady place, one under the bridge place to get money out of us. They disappeared when my husband called the american embassy. Is it illegal to make dance videos in Nigeria. Lets us Know the law.” Korra Obidi and her American husband, Justin Dean recently welcomed their first child.
