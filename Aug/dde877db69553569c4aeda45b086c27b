Berlin – Federal police in Germany hope to build a new structure and personnel to combat far-right extremist groups and lone attackers, the media outlets WDR, NDR and Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Monday reported. The reports cite an internal planning document from the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) that says up to 440 additional positions would be required to create a “central office for the fight against hate crimes.”The plan, presented to Germany’s Interior Ministry, has been driven by growing fears of right-wing militant extremism in the country. The BKA suggests building a new entity within its state protection department.Two groups would be dedicated to right-wing extremist crimes, the early identification of networks, identifying hate speech online and improving international coordination between authorities.
