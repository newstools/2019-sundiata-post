A recent crackdown on internet fraudters by the FBI has seen the arrest of at least 77 Nigerians in the US. Barely a week after CEO of Invictus Group, Obinwanne Okeke was arrested by Americaâ€™s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) over a $12 million (N4.3bn) fraud, the agency has arrested 77 more Nigerians.Â Following the arrest, Nigerians have taken to social media to react.Â Many are accusing Invictus Obi of snitching on others which could be the reason for the successful raid by the FBI.
