As usual, the pictures have attracted several criticisms on social media with the young lady from Edo State remaining unfazed. Barely 5 months after she went n*ked in a live video, Nollywood actress, model and comedienne, Etinosa Idemudia has dropped another teaser on social media. The divorcee who was trending for obnoxious reasons in March this year after stripping naked during an Instagram live video chat with singer MC Galaxy has gotten tongues wagging again. Etinosa initially posted a picture of herself lying in bed wearing panties, yellow shirt and a pair of colourful socks while operating a laptop. This was followed by another picture of herself in the same clothes but a different posture and then a video. She tried to distract her fans with a decent headline in one of the pictures which reads: “Write best at night. Then, I’m free to express myself. I am a scriptwriter. Oh you didn’t know?” As usual, the pictures have attracted several criticisms on social media with the young lady from Edo State remaining unfazed. It would be recalled that she became more popular in Nigeria after her nudity scandal. She attributed her odious act to the influence of alcohol. With the fresh momentum gathering again, fans will not be shocked if Etinosa decides to strip again for publicity purpose just like her fellow female celebrities. See more images: Source
