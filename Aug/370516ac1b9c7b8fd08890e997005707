The defendant, who is of no fixed address, is standing trial in the court on a two-count charge of felony and advance fee fraud. The Prosecuting Counsel, Insp Ayodeji Omoyeigha, told the court that the defendant on May 27, around 7:30 a.m. at Matanmi Street, Idepe in Okitipupa magisterial district, committed the offence. He said that the defendant obtained N972,500 from the complainant, one Rasheed  Olawoyin under a false pretence of supplying him 100 kegs of 25 litres of palm oil without doing so. Omoyeigha said that the defendant later refunded N286,000 when apprehended by the police but refused to refund the N686,500 balance.
