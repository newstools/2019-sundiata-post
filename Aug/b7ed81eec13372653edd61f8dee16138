By Aderemi Bamgbose Okitipupa – Academic activities began fully on Monday at the Ondo State University of Science and Technology ((OSUSTECH), Okitipupa after a week-long nationwide warning strike. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the week-long warning strike by Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) had grounded activities in public universities nationwide from Aug. 19 to Aug. 23. A NAN correspondent who visited the institution on Monday reports that the campus was bubbling with activities as members of the non-academic staff were seen at their duty posts. Peter Akindehinde, the NASU Chairman at the institution, told NAN that the Joint Association Congress (JAC) of the institution had instructed its members to resume duties. “We took the decision to join the strike after a JAC meeting, and had since instructed members to resume at their duty posts today. “Activities have resumed and members of NASU and SSANU are back at their duty posts since the strike was just for a week as instructed by the national bodies,” he said. NAN reports that the one-week nationwide strike embarked upon by the unions was to compel the Federal Government to implement the agreement reached with the unions in 2009.
