By Ige Adekunle Sango-Ota – The Idiroko Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun on Wednesday advised motorists against speeding on Idiroko Road to reduce the number of commercial motorcyclists being killed. Mr Akinwunmi Olaluwoye, the Idiroko Unit Commander of FRSC, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota, Ogun. Olaluwoye said there was need for motorists to take things easy on the route to ensure reduction in the number of accidents, especially the one that involve motorcycle operators. “We are doing everything possible to enlighten the motorcyclists to use crash helmet in order to avoid unnecessary loss of lives in the area,” the commander said. He advised motorists to be careful while approaching Atan area of the state to forestall recurring accident. Olaluwoye said that more officials of the corps would be patrolling the road from Owode to Idiroko before, during and after the Eid-el-Kabir festivities. According to him, this is to check the excesses of drivers and ensure free flow of traffic on the road.
