Following the directive by Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu state to stakeholders in all local governments to nominate commissioners, the people of Nsukka local government area have zoned their slot to Ovogovo in Nsukka west. The resolution was taken at a meeting held at the Adada hall, which was convened by the local government chairman, Hon. Patrick Omeje and chaired by Senator Fidelis  Okoro, with HRH Igwe Spencer Ugwuoke and HRH Igwe Tony Ezenwa as observers. Our correspondent gathered that before the decision was arrived at, former chairman of the Council, Barr. Tony Ugwu moved a motion, which was seconded by the honourable member representing Nsukka West State Constituency, Hon. (Dr.) Emma Ugwuerua. One of the stakeholders that attended the meeting told our correspondent that after an exhaustive deliberation “it was unanimously agreed that the commissioner slot be zoned to Ovogovo in Nsukka west” Ovogovo comprise of Edemani,Apka/Ozi,Aro uno,Ibagwani/Ibagwagu/Opkarigbo and Opkuje/Okwutu/Aluka Council Ward’s. According to him, the area was chosen “because  they are the only zone that have not  produced any commissioner since the creation of Enugu State” Our source further disclosed that the stakeholders consequently adopted a template for sharing appointments based on development centres. When asked to confirm the development, a former supervisor for education, Hon David Ugwu described the resolution as ” a welcome development”, saying that “zoning by development centers is more grass rooted than zoning by state consistencies” Also corroborating the resolution, another leader, Hon Okey  Ugwuanyi commended the Chairman of the local government for the peaceful way the meeting was conducted and “the laudable decision” that was taken.
