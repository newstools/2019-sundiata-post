Washington –  U.S. President Donald Trump, on Friday appeared to express frustration with the tensions between South Korea and Japan, saying Washington’s allies need to find a way to get along. “They are supposed to be allies, but they are fighting all the time. “They have to get along with each other, it’s very important,’’ Trump said. The president visited both countries in June. Japan angered South Korea in June, by tightening export controls on materials used in making chips and displays, arguing that their relationship had been ‘significantly undermined’. However, that decision came after South Korea’s top court in October ordered Japanese companies to compensate South Koreans for wartime forced labour during Japan’s 1910-1945 colonisation of the Korean Peninsula.
