Manchester United are ready to pay for Alexis Sanchez exit from Old Trafford this summer, according to The Sun. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has decided that the player will play no part in his plans this season and desperately wants the Chilean out. Solskjaer is now ready to dump winger into the Red Devils’ reserves side and offer Roma the cash to sign him on loan. Sanchez, who joined the Old Trafford club from Arsenal in January 2018, was left out of the United squad that beat Chelsea 4-0 on Sunday. The newspaper reports that Solskjaer is desperate to get rid of the £505,000-a-week flop. Roma want him on loan, despite not paying his massive wage bill.
