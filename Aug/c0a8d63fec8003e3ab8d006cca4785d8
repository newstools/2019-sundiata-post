Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The United State embassy in Abuja has denied reports that the US government has placed a Visa restriction on the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and some commissioners of the electoral body. A source at the embassy who didn’t want to be mentioned
told newsmen that the news is false as none of such directive has been given. The source said, “the US government refuses to be drawn
into any attempt to malign the INEC over the 2019 elections as issues arising
from the election are still in court.” The source also confirmed that quite a number of INEC ‘s
Commissioners we’re recently granted Visas to the US. It would be recalled that the joint forum of over 60
political parties and their presidential candidates in the 2019 election has
recently raised the alarm over alleged fresh plot orchestrated by a heavily
paid “network of blackmailers to smear the Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC) and discredit the nation’s electoral process.” According to the forum, ” the ultimate objective of this
campaign we have discovered is to sway the minds of the distinguished justices
of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court when the matter eventually comes
to the Court to rule against the declarations of results by INEC. Sources within INEC
also revealed that the report was not true and hinted that it could have been
planted to embarrass the Commission. “This is a lie. We
don’t understand why people will go this length to spread false information,”
the source said. The source  confirmed that INEC Commissioner Amina Zakari
who was mentioned in the blog post as banned from entering the US just returned
from the US a few days ago while Commissioner Lecky is right now in the US on
official duties. (Vanguard).
