By Alaba-Olusola Oke Ondo State – Dr Samuel Akintunde, Provost, Adeyemi College of Education, Ondo, has announced the approval of six new courses for the institution by the authorities of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife in Osun. The approved courses are African Languages and Literature Education, Business Education; Educational Management; Computer Science Education; Theatre/Creative Arts Education and Music Education. Akintunde made this known on Thursday while speaking at the August 2019 edition of the college’s Monthly Staff Meeting held on the campus. The provost described the development as good news, saying that the approval of the new courses would create new jobs and provide admission opportunities for new students. Akintunde lauded the staff of the college for their understanding and cooperation. He gave an assurance that his administration would not relent in promoting staff welfare. ‘’As a worker-friendly administration, we will always carry every member of the college staff along in implementation, plans and programmes aimed at taking the college to higher level,’’ he said Akintunde was optimistic of better days in the remaining part of the year. Earlier in a sermon, Pastor Johnson Falade, a religious leader and a lecturer, described the month of August as symbolic. Falade, therefore, urged the staff of the institution to have strong faith in God through constant communion “in order to experience divine encounter in the month and beyond’’. He called on workers in the institution to follow Jesus Christ and commit their ways to Him in the remaining part of the year, ‘’As you are following Jesus, He will surprise you in the remaining months. If you follow Jesus you will never lack anything,’’ he said. The event was attended by the school’s Registrar, Mrs Olufisayo Fakorede, deans and directors, heads of departments and units as well as other staff of the college
