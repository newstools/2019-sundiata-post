American former professional boxer who competed from 1985 to 2005, Mike Tyson, has said that he loves Indian hemp and spends thousands of dollars on it monthly. He confessed that he and his business partner don’t only smoke the weed, but they are currently developing a weed resort. He said that, together, he and his business partner, Eben Britton, consume about $40,000 worth of cannabis every month. As reported by several online platforms, Tyson, one of the most legendary boxers of all time, is currently working on becoming one of the biggest players in the marijuana game. The state of California, where Tyson has a ranch, allows for recreational use of the substance. Recreational marijuana is currently legal in 10 American states; while medical marijuana is legal in 33. Tyson’s ranch in California reportedly makes all sorts of cannabis products, which he also consumes.
