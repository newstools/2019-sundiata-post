 Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The National Hajj Commission, (NAHCON) has warned Nigerian pilgrims in Saudi Arabia and those still waiting to leave for the holy land to steer clear of all sorts of political and religious rallies or gathering. This was contained in a statement issued Friday from the office of the NAHCON Public Relation Officer, Fatima Sanda Usara, imploring pilgrims to concentrate on worship, which is their primary objective in the holy land. “Pilgrims are cautioned to desist from joining any group or organisation from any part of the world that intends to hold political/religious demonstrations or campaigns. Neither should they engage in political discussions detrimental to sanctity of the host country, nor allow themselves to be cajoled into joining any group that plans to violate Saudi Arabia’s Hajjguidelines,” the statement added Should there be entreaties of any sort in this regard, pilgrims are directed to report the persons to their state officials or call NAHCON help line on this number: 920008251. The statement also warned that; “displaying banners or pamphlets with political undertones whether on Muna tents, buses, pilgrims’ accommodations is not allowed. Only Islamic literature is to be carried along. Islamic scholars are urged to please guide pilgrims elaborately on this matter.” Meanwhile, the Saudi Arabian authority has declared August 10 as Arafat Day. Arafat Day is the height of the Hajj rites, when all pilgrims in the holy city of Makkah will converge on the plain of Arafat for supplications. The implication of this is that Ed-ul-Kabir, the Muslim festival when faithful sacrifice ram in accordance with the Islamic Sunnah will be observed on Sunday, August 11.
