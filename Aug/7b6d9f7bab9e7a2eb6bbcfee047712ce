Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Seyi has explained to Tacha why he decided to choose Esther to stay as his companion in the Head of House room. Recall that Seyi on Monday emerged as the new head of house after coming first in the egg rolling game. He was then asked to pick another housemate to share the head of house room with him. Seyi picked Esther, a development that was surprising to most housemates and fans as he was closer to Tacha. But, Seyi who seems to be getting intimate with Tacha said he chose Esther because Tacha bent her face down after Biggie announced him as the winner and put up a facial expression. Why he didnâ€™t pick Tacha to share HOH room:Tacha: You already had it in ur head dat if Biggie gets to throw d question, youâ€™ll say â€˜yen yenâ€™ðŸ˜‚ Seyi: I looked at u 1st so I could try to ask a question with my faceTa: Why were u even scared of getting a response ðŸ˜‚#BBNaija pic.twitter.com/RDoBV2spNQ
