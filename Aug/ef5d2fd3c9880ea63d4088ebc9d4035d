They were about 20 armed men came to the village and started hitting at doors but nobody opened. “They then forced their way into houses and vandalised properties. They carted away some valuables including mobile phones and clothing in my mother’s box. “They picked me together with my father. But after a while into the bush, I was released and they went away with my father. One of them was dressed in military camouflage. “As they released me, they threatened that if we fail to bring money in five days even though they didn’t mention the specific ransom, they will kill him. “We are yet to report to the police because even when we had similar experience in the past and we contacted them, they did not do anything about it. So, it is of no use,” he said. The kidnappers have contacted the pastor’s family, demanding for N20 million ransoky. Emmanuel Elisha, who confirmed the development said: “The kidnappers called this afternoon and demanded for N20 million ransom. “They still reiterated their threat that, they will kill him if we fail to bring the money within five days. “But, we are still negotiating with them, because we cannot raise N20 million.” Source
