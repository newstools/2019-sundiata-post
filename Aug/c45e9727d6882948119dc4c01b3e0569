After winning the Head of House task for this week in Big Brother Naija 2019: Pepper Dem, Seyi Awolowo a.k.a Sugar Daddy, â€˜Sucre Papitoâ€™ has emerged the new head of house. He became the head of house after completing his task in 45 seconds, a record that no one came close to beating, making him the Head of House for week six. The task was to get a tennis egg from one edge of a slim board to the other side using only one finger. Most of the housemates struggled with the task and spent a lot of time to complete it. Not only did Seyi just become the Head of House, he also just broke the â€˜first to play losesâ€™ curse by playing first and setting an unbeatable record. He was then asked to pick one housemate to share his Head of House room with but he decided to try his luck. He asked Big Brother if he could pick two housemates instead and he was turned down by Biggie. He then proceeded to pick Esther to share his room with him. Winning this Head of House challenge means that Seyi gets to control most of the activities in the house for this week. He is also free from nominations this week and has won another 250 Bet9ja coins in the house. Watch video below: So far so good, we still leading the score board for the HOH challenge. .
