An Ibadan-based trader, Janet Okupgo, on Wednesday begged a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan, to dissolve her marriage to her husband, Johnson, over continuous coercion to worship traditional deities with him, NAN reports. Testifying before the court, Janet said that she was frustrated by frequent battery which often arose from her discontinuation to further worship traditional deities with her husband. The plaintiff stated that as a Yoruba woman, she had for many years joined her husband in diligently worshipping the deities but that now she had turned a new leaf. According to NAN, Janet noted that she had gained nothing but disgrace from following her husband to the shrine. ‘’Nothing has ever changed for better in our family rather than complaints of unrealised ambition. ‘’As a drunkard, Johnson resorts to beating me up and my life is in serious threat as a result. ‘’He has made it a point of duty that if I dare complain on anything he does to me, I will surely suffer brutality from him. ‘’Currently, Johnson is threatening to kill me if I enter his home again,’’ she said. However, the respondent opposed the suit, praying the court to help him prevail on his wife not to call it quit. Johnson, who did not deny the allegation levelled against him, said that it might be disastrous for Janet if she leaves because of the tradition of his Urhobo tribe. He noted that he performed all the necessary traditional rites before marrying Janet, saying that was the reason why she could not leave without first appeasing the gods. “My lord, I am now born again, I have started attending Church and I will never beat Janet again,’’ Johnson pleaded. Reviewing the case carefully, Chief Ademola Odunade, the President of the court, concluded that there was need to allow the plaintiff to reconsider her position due to the promise made by the respondent. He adjourned the matter until Aug. 27 for further hearing.
