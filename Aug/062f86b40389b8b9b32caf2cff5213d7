Sundiata Post has reported that COZA Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo has returned to the pulpit to loud cheers from his congregation. The Pastor who has been accused by multiple people including the wife of Nigerian celebrity Timi Dakolo had stepped down from the pulpit to allow for investigations, but little has been known about what his church found out before his sudden return to work. Meanwhile the social media has a lot to say about this. Pastor Biodun and his fellow Rapist celebrating him as he stand on the Alter to preach. If you are member of #Coza and you were here clapping you are Rapist. pic.twitter.com/mQ3vjliwwv My prophetic tweet of Biodun Fatoyinbo yesterdayâ€¦The man is back to preaching, amnesia has caught everybody #COZA Im always happy to see how circumstance has turn my church to worldwide outbursts of Gods glory #COZA People on twitter dont deserve God's mercy. Quick to judge and never forgetting people's fault. So Pst Biodun cant stand back on the pulpit because God is unforgiven like u abi? #COZA pic.twitter.com/vddetFYop1 Ahhhhhhh!!!See introduction of your favorite pastor biodun at todayâ€™s service. #coza pic.twitter.com/uNZ6Mn7A2y Everyone should hear this, if you like kill Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, that I know you can't even do. We are #COZA for life. Some people can't just handle your decision and respect it. They just get bitter whenever they hear COZA. So, that's how the COZA saga died down. Or let me guess, Biodun Fatoyinbo is on the run or maybe Timi Dakolo & the wife have been bribed.Well, I'm still keeping my fingers crossed#COZA#Cozapastor I find it hard to believe that the #COZA Pastor mounted the pulpit and still had the church members cheering him on like a hero! ðŸ˜® Religion proves itself again as the biggest brainwashing technique in NigeriaSad ðŸ˜ž
