Reverend Obofour, the G.O of Anointed Palace Chapel, Ghana, has revealed that every pastor loves a woman with big buttocks. In an interview on his TV Show, he said that he is always stunned when people accuse Pastors of womanizing, when everyone loves big buttocks. According to him: “If all pastors in Ghana, elders and all church leaders are sitting and a woman with big buttocks passes, everyone will turn around and look at it because we all love big buttocks.” According to GhanaPage, the man of God who is one of the richest pastors in Ghana based his argument on the fact that some pastors who belong to organized churches believe they are better than pastors of one-man churches. It was said that the reverend noted that pastors of organized churches also believe that they are womanizers. He argued that their assumptions are not true because every pastor likes a big backside. GhanaPage also revealed that Obofour has always expressed his love for a lady with a big backside. He reportedly asked his wife to stand up during service to show off her backside to the congregation. Source
