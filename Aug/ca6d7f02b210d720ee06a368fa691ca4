Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo has urged leaders of the People’s Democratic Party, (PDP), to cross over to the  ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, before they die. Osinbajo made the appeal on a
lighter note during a dinner to celebrate 80th birthday former National
Chairman of APC, Chief John Oyegun in Abuja, over the weekend. According to him, “Let me tell the story of a politician who was a long time, life Republican politician in the US. He was lying down on his sick bed and was about to die and he said ‘I want to change my party, I want to become a Democrat so that tomorrow it will be announced that a Democrat died not a Republican’. “You can see that we politicians are
very faithful and very loyal, indeed. I can only ask our friends in the PDP to
also ensure that they cross over before they die. It is time for them to cross
over.” The Vice President went on to
eulogise Oyegun for his attributes as an astute politician. He said, “You always find him on the
right side of history, as a founding member of Alliance for Democracy AD,
member of NADECO and secretary of those abroad, founding member of APC and the
first chairman, the one who led our party to that historic victory to unseat
the ruling party. “The second reason for my admiration
is that somehow, he manages to be so deep in the Nigerian politics and yet he
doesn’t even look like a politician or sound like one. He always sounds like a
fine, well-read, well-spoken gentleman dragged into politics by some rascals
but he is an unassuming politician and an astute strategist. “There is this particular attribute
of being in politics without being a politician. I would like to be like
Professor (Ibrahim) Gambari when I grow up. I would like to be like that. You
know aside from lawyers, I think there is no group of people who are maligned
like politicians.
