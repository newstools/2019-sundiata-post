By Amen Gajira Minna – A Minna Magistrates’ Court in Niger  on Thursday  ordered the remand in prison of three farmers over alleged armed robbery, kidnapping and rape. Yusuf Sule, Saleh Sarki and Juli Baushe were docked on a four-count charge of conspiracy, armed robbery, kidnapping and rape. The prosecutor, Sgt. Emmanuel Ogiri, had told the court that one Abdullah Bako of Madagwa Village in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state reported the matter on Aug. 8. Ogiri said the complainant alleged that the defendants armed themselves with locally-made pistols and invaded Madagwa Village. He noted that the defendants robbed the complainant of N500, 000, kidnapped two women and raped two others. The prosecutor said that the defendants also illegally went into a provision store and made away with goods worth N127, 000. Ogiri said the offences were contrary to Sections 3(1), 2(1) of the Kidnapping Law of Niger, and Section 298 of the Penal Code. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The magistrate, Mrs Christiana Barau, however, declined to take their pleas on grounds that her court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Barau directed the police to forward a duplicate copy of the case file to the State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPPs) for legal advice. She adjourned the matter until Sept. 27 for further mention.
