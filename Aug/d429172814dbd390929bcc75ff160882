Irate locals in the Ijegun area of Lagos on Saturday lynched a policeman and injured two others over the shooting to death of a pregnant tailor and shop owner simply identified as Biliki. A report by The PUNCH quoted Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bala Elkana, as disclosing that the officers involved were Anti-Kidnapping operatives and not men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad as earlier reported by some media organs. “They were Anti-Kidnap, not SARS operatives. We don’t have the details of what happened for now. But the mob has killed one policeman and injured two. The area is still tense. But we are handling it,” the Lagos Police Spokesman reportedly said.
