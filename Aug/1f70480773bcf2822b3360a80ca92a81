Jerusalem – The Israeli government on Wednesday announced that they had concluded negotiations on a free trade deal with South Korea. The official agreement is expected to be signed within less than a year. The announcement was made in the presence of the South Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee and Israeli Economy and Industry Minister Eli Cohen. Israel hopes that the deal with South Korea will provide a competitive advantage and facilitate trade for Israeli exporters in the South Korean market. The Israeli Economy and Industry Ministry said in a statement “the annual benefit to the economy will facilitate a better jumping-off point for Israeli exports.’’ Under the agreement, some 95 per cent of the Israeli exports to South Korea will be exempted from customs duties. Some of the items excluded are machinery and electrical equipment, mechanical devices, fertilizer, medical equipment, cosmetics, plastics, metals, fruit juices, and wine. Moreso, customs duties will also be lowered on South Korean goods imported into Israel, includes, automobiles and automobile parts, refrigerators, medical equipment, electronic components, toys and games, plastics, and chemicals. Israel hopes that the agreement will further increase bilateral trade, which amounted to about 2.5 billion dollars in 2018, an almost 15-percent increase over 2017. The two countries have been in talks over the deal for the past three years. (Xinhua/NAN)
