The police have launched a hashtag campaign against the army over the killing of three policemen by soldiers in Taraba State. Police had said on Wednesday that the officers from the Intelligence Response Team who were taking a kidnap kingpin, Alhaji Hamisu Wadume, to the command headquarters in Jalingo were attacked by soldiers. They said the police officers were shot dead while the suspect was set free, but the army countered the claim, saying the policemen were mistaken for kidnappers. The police have now launched two hashtags to demand explanation from the army over the killings, despite a joint investigation panel set up by the police and the army over the incident. #ProvideAnswersNigerianArmy was launched late Thursday while #WhereIsEspiritDCorp was launched after the identities of the slain officers were revealed. #WhereIsEspiritDCorp pic.twitter.com/f534kGyF9x The police want the army to produce the suspected kidnapper and to answer the questions how and why Wadume was released instead of being taken to the army base for debriefing if truly he is a victim of kidnap. #ProvideAnswersNigerianArmy pic.twitter.com/uCDAjMLV1e Nigerians have expressed disappointment over the incident, calling it a show of shame by the countryâ€™s security agencies.
