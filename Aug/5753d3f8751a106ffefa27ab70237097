Manchester United goalkeeper, David De Gea, has been told he is no longer Spain’s No 1. De Gea had been the automatic first choice for Spain, since the end of Vicente del Bosque’s time in charge. But he recently dropped out of the side under new manager Robert Moreno. Moreno has picked Chelsea’s Kepa Arrizabalaga for the last three Spain matches. “My goalkeepers are De Gea, Kepa and [Roma’s] Pau Lopez. “I like that there is competition. Kepa is not ahead of De Gea, and neither is ahead of Pau. “I want to get to the Euros with three goalkeepers who are ready to compete. They are all playing at a high level and there are nuances and differences between them. All three have good footwork. “At Barca, we won the treble alternating goalkeepers,” Moreno told Cadena SER.
