Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp has revealed his plans for life when he finally quits the club. The 52-year-old said on Monday that he will take a one-year break from football after leaving the UEFA Champions League winners. Klopp joined Liverpool from Borussia Dortmund in 2015. His current contract with the Anfield club will end in 2022. The German gaffer led the Reds to the Champions League title last season while finishing a close second to Manchester City in the Premier League. “I have absolute energy. But I have one problem. I can’t do ‘a little bit’. I can only do ‘all or nothing’,” Klopp told Germany’s Kicker magazine. “When I decide that I cannot do it any longer then I will take a break for a year.” “After that year (break) a decision must then be taken,” Klopp added. “But chances are very high that my energy level will then be there once more and that I can then do the job the way I want to.”
