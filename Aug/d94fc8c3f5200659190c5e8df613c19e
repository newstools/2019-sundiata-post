We boarded a golf 2 on charter as it was the only means to move.The driver was careful enoug,  so I had no issues with him but then, out of the blues, a truck jumped right in front of us. The road was wet as it had been drizzling. The driver tried all he could to stop the car but the slippery road just made it look like he did nothing all I was shouting was “JESUS! JESUS!! JESUS!!!” and with a speed of about 100km/H or there about, we rammed right into the back of this truck. God being so merciful and wonderful, we got of with very minor injuries. How the tail of the truck was stopped from causing major damage on us is just God’s doing. God I thank you for life, I thank You for Your Mercies , I thank You for Your Grace and for your love on sinners like us. May your name be glorified forever in Jesus Mighty Name!!! Amen!!! #mylordliveth #klintdadrunk #thankyoulord . Source
