Alaba-Olusola Oke Akure   –     The Ondo State Government has reiterated its commitment to boosting its economy through small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in the state. Mr Olatunji Ifabiyi, the Special Adviser (SA) on Commerce, Industries and Cooperatives to Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, stated this during a stakeholders’ meeting on Monday in Akure. Ifabiyi said that the state government would do everything within its capacity to boost SMEs activities in the state by encouraging economic activities. The SA promised that the government would revamp its industrial park, popularly known as Onyearugbulem Industrial Park, in Akure, by meeting up with the original master plan of the park. According to him, government will equally create an enabling environment for business and economy activities to thrive. Ifabiyi said the stakeholders’ meeting was called in order to fashion a way out of the present shabby state of the park. He said the park was in a state of complete disrepair when he led the management team of the ministry on an oversight visit there a couple of days ago. He said the interactive meeting was put in place to address some vital challenges facing the park in terms of revenue generation, maintenance, rent charges and non ppayment of revenue, among others. Ifabiyi, however, expressed optimism that the meeting would further bring mutual relationship among occupants at the park as well as cordial relationship with the government at all times. Mr George Omoode, who spoke on behalf of the industrialists, described the meeting as a proactive move that would engender development of the area and also increase the revenue drive of the state government. Omoode said that the industrial park was the industrial hub to showcase the economy of Ondo State. He promised that the industrialists would be ready at all time to complement the efforts of the state government.
