A Nigerian social media influencer, Olivia Malachy has taken to her social media page to reveal a sad experience she had at a church recently. Malachy who is known for serving as an inspiration to many people with her videos and photos shared the experience and wrote: “My experience in one church the other day (name of the church withheld), a female church member refused to hold my hand because am an amputee.
We were asked by the pastor to hold each other’s hands in prayer, so I held the hand of the person sitting next to me, after the first round of prayer we were asked to hold another person’s hand and I gave this fine sister my hand˜
She was like bring the second hand and I told her I have problem with my hand, OMO na so the sisi quickly dropped my hand, and I asked her what the problem was?
She said my hands were not complete and she left and went in search of a complete hand.
I was heart broken though but I can’t come and kill myself, I believe am going to hug thousands of people maybe not with two hands but with a Golden heart…
Moral! No man can LOVE YOU LIKE GOD� #Superwoman.” Read her post below: My experience in one church the other day (name of the church withheld) a female church member refused to hold my hand because am an amputee, we were asked by the pastor to hold each other’s hands in prayer, so I held the hand of the person sitting next to me, after the first round of paryer we were asked to hold another person’s hand and I gave this fine sister my hand, 😂😂😂she was like bring the second hand and I told her I have problem with my hand, OMO na so the sisi quickly dropped my hand,and I asked her what the problem was?
