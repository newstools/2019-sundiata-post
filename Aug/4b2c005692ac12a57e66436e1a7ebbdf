Madrid – Gibraltar’s Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the release of an Iranian oil tanker seized by the British overseas territory more than a month ago, the Gibraltar Chronicle newspaper reported. The British troops helped capture the tanker Grace 1 on July 4, off Gibraltar, alleging that the vessel was carrying oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions. However, the vessel was scheduled to be released on Thursday, but at the last minute, the U.S. reportedly asked Gibraltar’s government not to lift the detention. After the Grace 1 was impounded, Iran responded by seizing the British-flagged Stena Impero and the Panama-flagged MT Riah in the Strait of Hormuz.The strait is a strategically important shipping route to and from the oil-rich Gulf region.
