By Abubakar Ahmed Gusau – The Zamfara government says it will provide 3,000 hectares of land and sink N100 million into agricultural revival schemes to attract youths into the sector. Alhaji Bello Matawalle, in a `Sallah’ message to the people on Sunday in Gusau, said that the scheme would create jobs and guard against indolence and criminality among the youths. He said that government would bring in experts to train the youths in various farming skills and provide them with land, farm implements, improved seeds and capital to start off a “revolution” in the agricultural sector. “At the end of each farming season, the government will also ensure that there is a ready market for the products,” he explained. On security, Matawalle expressed happiness that armed banditry and other crimes were reducing, adding that  government was making adequate arrangements for peaceful coexistence among the people. He warned traditional rulers against condoning the `Yansakai’ terrorist group that had been barred by 11 northern states governors, saying that any monarch caught would not be spared. Matawalle, who recently sacked a second class emir and a district head from Maru and Kanoma respectively, said that government would not allow anyone to threaten the freedom of others. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the Eid-el Kabir celebration was going on smoothly in the hitherto crises-ridden north-western state as at the time of filing this report, with more people massing into the streets of Gusau, the state capital, unlike the situation in the past.
