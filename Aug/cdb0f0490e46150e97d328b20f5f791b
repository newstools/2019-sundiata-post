By Clara Egbogota Lagos – The NasruLlhail-fatih Society (NASFAT) on Monday said it would organise a summer holiday training for Muslim children and in order to deepen their interfaith relations and tolerance. The Chief Missioner of NASFAT, Imam Abdulazeez Onike, said the training entitled `Reloading the Deen`  would be a three -day residential training . Onike said that the training would inculcate the principles of interfaith relations in children and teach them the need for peaceful coexistence in the country. According to him, the programme, which is the third in a series, will hold at NICON Hotel & Suites, Victoria Garden City (VGC), Lekki-Ajah Expressway, Lagos between Aug. 23 and 25. He said that it was targeted at children between the ages of 12 and 25 years. Onike said that a programme such as this was key to promoting inter-religious harmony and peace in Nigeria. He said multi-ethnic and multi-religious nature of Nigeria as well as the spate of inter and intra-religious misconceptions among most Nigerians, fueled religious bigotry, ethnic jingoism and violence in parts of the country. “NASFAT believes that continuous engagement of children and youths in each religion to have proper understanding of their religion, has become expedient for peaceful coexistence and harmonious relationship in Nigeria,” he said. Onike urged parents and guardians to seize the opportunity of the summer holiday to enroll their wards for the training, adding that that the summer camp was significantly beneficial to the nation. “I encourage parents and guardians to leverage this initiative and expose their children to better understanding of Islam, instead of allowing them to be idle at home,” he said.
