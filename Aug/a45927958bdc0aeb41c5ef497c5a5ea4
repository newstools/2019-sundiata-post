“In 1996 – During the election to be senator in GUI senatorial district which i won but before i was sworn in, the head of state passed on. In 2006 – I attempted to be governor of ogun state but i came second in the election after losing Gbenga Daniel. In 2015 – I ran to be senator in ogun sate in the same ogun east but it was not meant to be. In 2018 – I didn’t want to run but all lines kept on falling in pleasant places because God was preparing me for this journey. God places people in our part because he wants us to achieve our destiny.” Dapo Abiodun also solicited for prayers because he believed the battle is not yet over.

To be accountable
To be inclusive
To be participatory. So Help Me God”
