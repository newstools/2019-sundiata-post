Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Cindy has disclosed why she wants fellow housemate, Frodd, saved from this Sunday’s live eviction. It was reported that seven BBNaija housemates including: Mike, Seyi, Mercy, Diane, Frodd, Jackie and Gedoni, have been selected for possible eviction this week. The housemates were nominated after the ‘Cruisetopia team’ were defeated during the arena game challenge. Elozonam, who won the veto power on Sunday, saved Venita and replaced her with Frodd from her team, ‘Cruisetopia’. But Cindy, while speaking with Big Brother during her diary session on Tuesday night said she would want Frodd to be saved from the Sunday night eviction because she likes him and find him interesting. “I’ve gotten to know Frodd a little bit, he’s not troublesome but defensive which is being misunderstood by housemates. “I feel housemates do not like Frodd because they try to counter what he believes “He’s very talented, viewers still need to get to know him. Please, Nigerians vote for Frodd,” Cindy added.
