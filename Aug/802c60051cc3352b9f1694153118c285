Long story short, I finally did the surgery In a clinic in abuja called Brain and Spine Surgery Consotium. I want to say a very big thank u to friends and family who went out of their way to support with d huge surgery bill, I will never forget u for supporting instead of looking for lame heartless reasons and excuses not to help. God bless u all immensely. Who says Brain, Spine and other delicate Surgeries can’t be done in Nigeria? I’m recuperating fine. Help me thank God.” See Photos: Source
