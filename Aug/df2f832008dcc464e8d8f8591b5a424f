Real Madrid believe Manchester United will allow Paul Pogba to leave, if they sign Christian Eriksen from Tottenham, according to Marca. United are attempting to secure the signing of Eriksen before England’s transfer deadline on Thursday evening. If that deal goes through, then United may be more open to selling Pogba, who has been heavily linked with a departure from Old Trafford. The Spanish transfer window doesn’t close until September 2, meaning Real still have plenty of time to pursue a move for Pogba. Real have been heavily active in the transfer market this summer, securing deals for Eden Hazard, Luka Jovic and Ferland Mendy, among others. But Zinedine Zidane is eager to add another player to his squad, with Pogba one of his key targets.
