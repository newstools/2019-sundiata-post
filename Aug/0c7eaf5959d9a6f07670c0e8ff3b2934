I’ve always told people that Nasir el-Rufai is Muhammadu Buhari writ small–figuratively, but you can take it literally if you want. A court has granted Shiite leader, El-Zakzaky, a medical bail, outlining its premise in the ruling. But instead of appealing the ruling if he does not like it, the Buhari wanna-be and mini dictator of Kaduna, has announced several conditions that must be met before he obeys the court’s order. RIP rule of law in Nigeria under Buhari. Even under Abacha, the government would usually find a friendly, pliant judge to issue counter rulings, grant stays of execution, or listen to emergency appeals on rulings the government did not like. It never arbitrarily issued conditions for obeying a valid court order. So this must be a first, another in the long line of odious, anti-democratic firsts under Buhari. The Buhari administration and its clone in Kaduna continue to break new, dangerous ground in illegality, fascism, and authoritarianism. It started small, with Kaduna as the testing ground. There was no outrage. They then escalated it with the sacking of Justice Onnoghen. Many, including some lawyers, even justified the political emasculation of the judiciary in that instance. We will see if those rationalizing these actions today say anything when a future leader takes a cue from the Buhari-El-Rufai political playbook. The danger of dictatorship is not only the present harm it causes but also the fact that, as a precedence, it is self-replicating. Source: Facebook
