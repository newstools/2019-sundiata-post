Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ilorin zonal office have detained the General Manager of the Kwara State Television Authority, Abdulfatai Adebowale, and three others over allegations bordering on land fraud. A statement by the EFCC’s Head of Media, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, on Friday, indicated that Adebowale was being interrogated alongside a senior official of the Kwara State Bureau of Lands and two employees of the state television. According to the anti-graft body, the immediate past governor of the state, Abdulfatah Ahmed, sometime in 2014, allocated 10 plots of land on the premises of the station located at Apata Yakuba, Ilorin, to some employees of the station. The commission said 13 workers of the television through a petition dated May 8, 2019, alleged that the station’s general manager sold 10 plots of land given by the state government and converted the proceeds to personal use. They alleged in the petition that, “Since 2014 till date, the said plots of land was hijacked by the Abdulfatai Adebowale against the purpose intended by the state government for staff of the corporation. The commission said during investigations, it discovered that “the general manager and his son benefited from the land while the remaining ones were sold to outsiders without the knowledge of the staff.” The EFCC said the suspects would soon be charged to court after the completion of investigation.
