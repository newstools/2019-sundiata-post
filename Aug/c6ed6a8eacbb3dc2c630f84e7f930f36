Social media has been busy following news of physical assault on Senator Ike Ekweremadu in Germany by people alleged to be members of IPOB. See reactions below, including those from Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki. Ike Ekweremadu was stoned for collaborating with Fulani People – IPOBThe more IPOB internet enablers try to spin the German attack as a fight for Nigeria and good governance, the more the Biafra Leader tells them. Hell NO! It is about hatred for the Fulani.Delusion 101. Kwara people didn't have to waylay Saraki abroad and jump him like cowards. They ended his reign with the ballot box. All the beating in the world will not stop Ike Ekweremadu from picking up his 13.5m running cost at the end of the month as a senator representing Enugu Attack on Sen Ekweremadu in Germany by miscreants allegedly from IPOB totally condemnable. Equally unacceptable are the justifications for this attack currently circulating on social media. If you’ve tried justifying it, shame on you. Violence should never be acceptable. I spoke with my brother and friend, Sen. Ike Ekweremadu yesterday after hearing about the unfortunate incident in Germany and I thank God that he is fine and very well. What happened to my friend and brother Sen. Ike Ekweremadu in Nuremberg, Germany at the hands of IPOB is an eye-opener and clear signal to every political leader in southern Nigeria!The people of the south are getting angry and you either stand up and defend them or stand aside! Attackers of Ekweremadu,a defender of democracy who symbolizes courage & decency, are miscrants who don't deserve a place in a civilized society. It is an assault against the Igbos and Nigerians in general. To me, those "Igbo touts" demonstrated that pigs have no value for gold. Ike Ekweremadu was attacked in Germany today by some folks at a New Yam Festival event. This stands condemned but it should signal to our politicians that they need to be careful when they travel abroad. No DSS/Police here to deal with anyone. Max, they'll be charged for assault. You hate to hear it because everyone on twitter is politically correct… Yes! Even you reading this tweet, but I will say it.When they start giving Akpabios, Amaechi, Ikpeazu etc the Ekweremadu treatment abroad, then the Elites will sit up and pay attention Which politician do you want to be beating up next just like they did to Ike Ekweremadu ??? Mention their twitter handles dont be scared 😁😁😁😂 pic.twitter.com/Hdg2HnULlb
