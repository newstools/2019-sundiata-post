Former Super Eagles coach, Samson Siasia, claims he did not know anything about his purported ban by world football governing body, the Federation of International Football Association (FIFA). News had filtered into Nigeria, on Friday afternoon, of a life ban reportedly imposed on Siasia by FIFA over alleged match-fixing. In a terse message sent to The Nigerian Xpress by a close ally of the embattled football tactician, he denied ever being contacted by FIFA over his reported ban. The statement said, “I don’t know anything about this. I did nothing wrong and I have not received any letter from FIFA.” Siasia said further that he was never invited to defend himself and was hearing about the purported ban on the internet. The ally, however, said Siasia would fight on to clear his name of the match-fixing allegation.
