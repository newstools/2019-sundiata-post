Former US president Barack Obama has revealed his summer playlist, and featuring on the list is ‘Iron Man’ by Nigerian budding star, Rema. The Obamas reveal their playlist every year, and this is probably the first time a Nigerian artist is on the list. With summer winding down, here’s a sampling of what Michelle and I have been listening to — some new, some old, some fast, some slow. Hope you enjoy. pic.twitter.com/BS5ri1lvxz And Nigerian fans, including the star and his label boss, Don Jazzy were excited.
