The Governor of Zamfara State announced that he has sacked the Emir of Maru, Abubakar Cika for aiding and abetting bandits in the state. The state has come under a lot of attack from bandits in the past months. We have sacked the Emir of Maru, Abubakar Cika for aiding and abetting bandits in the state, He will be prosecuted with the district head of Kanoma, Ahmed Kanoma. Itâ€™s a shame that leaders who are suppose to protect their communities are the front runners of its destruction. A lot of people commend his decision. It's a bold step taken. There is need to investigate other traditional rulers on their role to aiding cattle rustling and kidnapping in the state. And if found guilty should be made to face the wrath of the law. May you succeed in your governance If he's truly involved and given a fair trial and he's unable to defend himself, he should be tried, prosecuted and jailed. God will continue to guide and give you the courage to make Zamfara state peaceful once again!
