Jamila Elmi, a resident of the town said: “hooded men attacked the army’s base in the area and shortly after we heard the sound of mortar shells.’’ The latest counter offensive came barely two days after government forces killed 20 militants injuring more than 30 others in another counter attack in Barire town in southern region of Lower Shabelle.However, Al-Shabab also claimed victory from Tuesday’s attack saying its fighters briefly captured an army base in Shimbirow village and seized weapons and ammunitions from them. The government forces had so far rescued 20 civilians who had been abducted by the militant group after an operation carried out in southern port town of Kismayo. Military officials said the rescue operation was carried out in villages within the vicinity of Yontoy, north of Kismayo. The al-Qaida militants had in recent time intensified their attacks on the army bases in Middle and Lower Shabelle regions after they lost many of their strong holds in those regions. (Xinhua/NAN)
