Ex-governor Peter Ayodele Fayose has on Twitter reacted to the attack on Senator Ike Ekweremadu in Germany referring to the attackers as miscreants. “Attackers of Ekweremadu, a defender of democracy who symbolizes courage & decency, are miscrants who don’t deserve a place in a civilized society. It is an assault against the Igbos and Nigerians in general. To me, those “Igbo touts” demonstrated that pigs have no value for gold.” He tweeted.
