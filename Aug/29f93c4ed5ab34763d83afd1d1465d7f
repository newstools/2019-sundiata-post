Abuja – The US Embassy has denied blocking appointment dates for visa interview of Nigerians seeking to travel to their country. The Public Affairs Department of the Embassy made this known in response to a question by a correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja on Wednesday. The embassy said, “There has been no block on visa interviews. There are interview appointment opportunities available”, in a very short reply. NAN reports that a visa interview is intended for a more in-depth communication between the applicant and the representative of a diplomatic office. A citizen of a foreign country, who wishes to enter the US is expected to first obtain a visa, either a non-immigrant visa for temporary stay or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. NAN reports that on August 20, some social media platforms reported that Nigerians who had applied for US visa could not get appointment dates for an interview despite payment of Visa fees. According to the reports, after payment, once an applicant attempts to make an interview appointment, the applicant is informed through the US Embassy’s consultant website CGI INC that there are no available dates for visa appointments.
