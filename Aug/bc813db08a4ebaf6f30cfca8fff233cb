Zhukovsky (Russia) – Russian state arms maker Tactical Missiles Corporation says it was not tasked with designing a new weapon in the wake of the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Director General of the corporation Boris Obnosov made this known to reporters on Thursday at the MAKS-2019 air show in the Moscow Region. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the military last week to come up with a “symmetrical response” to the U.S. test of a modified Tomahawk cruise missile, launched mere weeks after Washington quit the Cold-War era arms control pact on Aug. 2. “We do not work as fast as the Americans, who have just exited (the treaty). “We are a law-abiding country. We have a system of restrictions that is based on our international commitments and is vigorously monitored,” Boris Obnosov told reporters. He said that the Russian defense industry needed time to “process all this” because it would be inappropriate for it to plunge itself into what he said seemed like a relentless arms race.He, however, added that the government was thinking this through.
