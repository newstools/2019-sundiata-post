Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) has claimed that the Nigerian government, is frustrating the medical treatment of their leader, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, in India. El-Zakzaky and his wife flew out of Nigeria on Monday, based on a leave granted by a Kaduna High Court. The Shiites leader was accompanied by some family members and security operatives. In a statement on Tuesday, secretary of academic forum of the movement, Abdullahi Musa, alleged that the federal government and some “security operatives working for the US” were conniving to ensure that the IMN leader would not be treated. Musa said the management of Madenta Hospital, New Delhi, had been threatened not to admit him for treatment. “Reports reaching us from the hospital indicate that the security agents are colluding with foreign security agents believed to be working for American government. “Even before the Sheikh arrived the hospital, we gathered from competent source that officials of American embassy in India instructed management of the hospital not to admit the Sheikh for treatment. “The source added that even as the doctors were enthusiastically waiting to receive the Sheikh to save his life, the American secret agents have threatened the hospital officials not to go ahead to treat the Sheikh at the hospital,” the statement read. The group, however, called on the international community and “people of conscience” to prevail on the Nigerian government and its “western masters”, to stop playing with El-Zakzaky’s life.
