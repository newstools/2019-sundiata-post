Asisat Oshoala scored a brace for Barcelona in their 5-2 victory over Arsenal in a pre-season friendly on Wednesday. It was the first time Oshoala was facing her former club since she left in January 2017. Before the game, the 25-year-old had scored four goals in the Spanish giants’ back-to-back warm up wins over Amed [13-0] and Marseille [5-0]. Oshoala fired the visitors in front after Patri Guijjaro cancelled Katie McCabe’s opener before half-time. Five minutes after the restart, the Nigerian extended the tally for Lluís Cortes’ side before Claudia Pina’s brace overshadowed Kim Little’s effort from the spot. Oshoala has now scored six goals in three matches for the Liga Iberdrola side.
