Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Joe has informed Omashola why some housemates dislike him in the ‘Pepper Dem’ edition. Omashola on Friday caused an unrest in the house after he shouted at housemates hiding eggs in different corners of the house. He picked a quarrel with Frodd and Esther for hiding foodstuff away from the kitchen and described housemates hiding foodstuff as self-centred and having a poverty mentality. Omashola also picked a quarrel with Diane and Venita later on Friday evening after he was accused of calling their teammates ‘weaklings’. This made Omashola emotional and later withdrew from housemates as he felt disliked by some housemates. But Joe has now advised Omashola to ignore hate comments, adding that only winners are disliked. He urged Omashola to keep being himself, but stop shouting. Joe told Omashola: “Keep being yourself Omashola, you are a winner.”
