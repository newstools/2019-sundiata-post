Big Brother Naija ex-housemate, BamBam, has said that her relationship with Teddy A started as a game. Teddy A and BamBam announced their engagement last Sunday. Discussing their relationship in an interview with punchng.com, she said: “Fate happened to us. I can’t say it was pre-planned. He had a serious relationship that was one-year-old before I met him. He had a girlfriend he was serious with, so we did not plan to fall in love with each other. We did not know we would last this long. “We had a very rare connection in the house. We both knew it but we kept telling ourselves ‘it’s just for the game’ but it was no game. So, I can’t predict what fate has designed. So, people should not go in there hoping to be a Teddy A and BamBam. I went to the house for a different purpose, but ended up getting Teddy as a bonus.” The lovebirds made headlines for their relationship during and after reality TV show, Big Brother Naija. Since leaving the house, they have been seen together at events, cinemas, having meetings with politicians and generally having a great time. In May 2018, they were the cover stars of the love edition of The Celebrity Shoot magazine where they talked about their relationship and brand. Source: qed.ng
