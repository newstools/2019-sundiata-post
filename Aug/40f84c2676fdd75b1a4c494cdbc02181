Srinagar (India) – Security forces have detained 30 people in Srinagar, in bid to keep a tight lid on protests over the federal government’s decision to strip the region of its autonomy. Local officials reported on Tuesday that the arrest was done overnight in Indian Kashmir’s main city of Srinagar. Crowds have demonstrated frequently in the city in spite of a severe clampdown on phone and internet services. A ban was also made on public gatherings and detentions of hundreds of political leaders and separatists who have long campaigned for secession from India. Youth have pelted stones at paramilitary police deployed in Srinagar, and the latest detentions took place in parts of the city where such incidents have occurred, a police officer said. A local government official, however, confirmed the latest detentions. The withdrawal of the special privileges of Muslim majority in Kashmir means residents of all parts of India can buy property and compete for government jobs and college places. This decision raised fears that Kashmir would be flooded with outsiders. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move with arch rival, Pakistan has also increased tensions. U.S. President Donald Trump spoke to Modi and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday urging them to reduce tensions over Kashmir. “A tough situation, but good conversations’’ Trump said in a Twitter post after the calls. Authorities in Indian Kashmir on Monday said the protests were local and small in nature involving no more than a dozen people. Primary schools remained deserted as parents worried about the safety of their children and kept them at home.
