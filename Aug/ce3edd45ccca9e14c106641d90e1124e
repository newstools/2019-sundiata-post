By Martha AgasJos – The National Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ), Plateau chapter, has called for support for molested children in the state in order to ameliorate their psychological and mental trauma. The Chairperson of the union, Mrs Jennifer Yarima, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) on Wednesday in Jos. Yakima said support by spirited individuals and organisations would help such children’s reintegration into the society and to fight the menace. “We solicit support from government and other critical stakeholders, toward finding lasting solutions to the plight of these set of children and other less privileged children in the state,” she said. NAN reports that  the association  had reported a case of sexual molestation in 2017 of no fewer than 20 children from northern states who were on scholarship awarded to them by the proprietor of the Stephen Children Centre, Abeokuta. She also said the group  had organised a seminar for school children of between the ages of 10 years and 15 years on the need to report assault by their teachers, neighbours and family members. She expressed worry about the rising reports of child rape and physical battery, saying concerted efforts by parents, the community and government must be made to address the menace.
