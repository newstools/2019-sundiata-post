Aisha Buhari, wife of President Muhammadu Buhari has been seen stoning the devil in Mecca. Aisha Buhari stoning the devil  Nigeria’s First Lady, Aisha Buhari has been spotted in Mecca stoning the devil. What she is doing is a part of the annual Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. During the ritual, Muslim pilgrims throw pebbles at three walls (formerly pillars), called jamarāt, in the city of Mina just east of Mecca. It is one of a series of ritual acts that must be performed in the Hajj. It is a symbolic reenactment of Abraham’s hajj, where he stoned three pillars representing the temptation to disobey God and preserve Ishmael. On Eid al-Adha (the 10th day of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah), pilgrims must strike each of the three jamarat with seven pebbles. After the stoning is completed on the day of Eid, every pilgrim must cut or shave their hair. On each of the following two days, they must hit each of the three walls with seven pebbles, going in order from east to west. Thus at least 49 pebbles are needed for the ritual, more if some throws miss.
