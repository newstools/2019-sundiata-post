Kidnapped Enugu monarch, Igwe Sunday Orji of Obom-Agbogugu, Awgu Local Government Area and his wife, Alice, have been rescued. A family source said they regained freedom on Wednesday night. They were kidnapped, last Sunday evening, just after the Agbogugu-Ihe junction, along the Enugu-Portharcourt Expressway, while they were returning from the reception and Thanksgiving Mass in honour of the mother of the Catholic Bishop of Awgu Diocese. They were kidnapped at the very axis where Rev Fr Paul Offu was shot dead three days earlier. The axis, Awgu, on Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway has become a hotbed of kidnappers and armed robbers. A family member confided in our correspondent that an undisclosed ransom was paid. The kidnappers, suspected to be herdsmen had in their initial contact with the family demanded N50m ransom; they later brought the amount down to N20m. Enugu police command spokesman, Superintendent Ebere Amaraizu confirmed the release of the monarch.
