Mercy Johnson’s husband, Prince Odianosen Okojie, pens down lovely words to celebrate his wife on her 35th birthday. Prince Odianosen Okojie said she is an exceptional personality and partner in progress not in crime. He wrote: “There is nothing unusual about today, Because I celebrate you each day that comes. You are an Exceptional Personality and my Faith and Trust in you will never Diminish. While many see their Spouses as “Partner in Crime” I see you as my “Partner in Progress”. That is who you are to me!! So, On the occasion of your Birthday, I pray that you will continue to grow in Love, Faith, Grace and May God give you more PEACE. Happy Birthday My Darling Wife, I Love You.” See More Photos: Source
