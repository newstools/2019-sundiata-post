Sundiata Post has reported that President Muhammadu Buhari has today inaugurated his cabinet and announced their Portfolios. Following this long waited action to begin the government’s planned Next Level phase, Nigerians have a lot to say about the announcement. Take a look: This is a complete list of incompetency. There's nothing to expect from these combinations. Sylva ministry of petroleum? How? As as how na? What's his experience or qualifications? God please wipe out this set of Nigerian leaders.
