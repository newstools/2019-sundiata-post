Olusegun Olowokere popularly known as Iceberg Slim, a little known Nigerian rapper, and ex boyfriend of the seductive light skinned Ghanaian actress, Juliet Ibrahim took to his instagram page to apologise and take the blame for their sour break up . The question on the mind of fans is why now? Could it be the condition he was given for a reunion ? It marks a complete turn around from his former stand when the screen goddess initially announced their break up on social media last year. He had wrote on his insta story: “When a Toxic person can no longer control you, they’ll try to control how others see you. The misinformation will feel unfair, but stay above it, trusting that other people will see the truth, just like you did.” Whatever the case, this seems like another Neymar vs Barcelona love story. Whose plots begin with cozy love, followed by bitter break up and laying of blame, to a come and get me plea. The turn of event will tell the full story as we all sit with our fingers crossed and await the response of aunty Juliet. Maybe truly, true love never dies, it just fades, then reignite ?
