Maureen Ojinaka Enugu – Two men, David Nwanna, 42 and Chidi Anyalebechi, 40,  were arraigned at an Enugu South Magistrates’ Court in Enugu on Thursday for allegedly assaulting their female neighbour. The defendants, who were arraigned on charges of conspiracy and assault, pleaded not guilty. The Police Prosecutor, DSP Chime, told the court that the matter was reported at the Enugu Central Police Station on July 5 by the complainant, one Miss Ngozi Ugwu. Chime said that the police tried to settle the matter as it was over a misunderstanding between the defendants and the complainant. He said that the defendants refused to make peace with the complainant, but continued to beat the complainant. The police prosecutor opposed the bail application of the defendants, saying that the continuous beating of the complainant had led to serious injuries on her body. The defense counsel to the defendants, Mr A Ugwu, told the court to use its discretion in granting the bail. The Magistrate, Mr Denis Ekoh, granted the bail of N20, 000 each to the defendants with one surety each who should be residents within the court’s jurisdiction. He directed that the sureties should submit two passport size photographs and adjourned the matter untill Sept. 9 for hearing.
