Super Eagles Forward Laments Poor Treatment From NFF, Technical Crew
Super Eagles Forward Laments Poor Treatment From NFF, Technical Crew Super Eagles forward, Brown Ideye has revealed that he’s not happy to have been neglected by the technical crew of the senior national team and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). Ideye was part of the Super Eagles team that won the 2013 Africa Cup of Nation in South Africa under late team’s manager, Stephen Keshi, where they defeated Burkina Faso 1-0 in the final. Having signed a new deal with Aris Saloniki in Greece, the 30-year-old told Sports Extra that he may be forced to quit the national team in a bid to focus on his club career. He said: “I’ve come to realise I’m unlikely to ever play for my country again,” Ideye told Sports Extra. “I think I’m more than capable of doing a job for my country. But the fact is that I have been out for 12 months, it’s only best I focus more on getting back to my very best and my club career.” “It is unfortunate from my point of view but it’s quite plain to see I’m not in their plans. “Still, I would love to be involved. Representing my country was always the ultimate honour, but it’s just not going to happen any time soon.”
