It has been reported that some Ikorodu residents squared up to some operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) over an alleged illegal arrest in the neighborhood. The SARS officers were reportedly in the Lagos community to arrest a young man they accused of being a yahoo boy (internet fraudster). They were however stopped and quickly drove out after residents of the area trooped out shouting ‘ole’ (thief).
