It was a case of bravery as six-year-old Feranmi Bukola escaped being killed by her abductor on Thursday. Feranmi was abducted in her house while sleeping beside her mother, Daily Trust reports. The suspect, who was later identified by Feranmi to be a neighbour, covered Feranmi’s mouth to prevent her from raising the alarm. Narrating her ordeal, Feranmi said she was shocked when they got outside of the house and the man brought out a knife to kill her. She shouted, and the suspect ran away. Her mother, Mrs. Mary Jumai Samaila Bukola, said she woke up after hearing a loud noise. She said, “I woke up around 3 am when I heard a noise like someone wanted to kill an animal, and then I realized that my daughter was no longer by my side. I got to the corridor and the main door open, only to see my daughter struggling with the man outside. “When I saw the man holding a long knife, I shouted for help. He took to his heels and I pursued him with stones for a while and then carried my daughter back into the house.” Unfortunately for the suspected abductor, Feranmi identified him when he visited the house in the morning. As soon as Feranmi sighted him, she shouted, pointing at him as the man who tried to abduct and kill her. Even when other men were brought before her for identification at the Area F Police Station, Tanke, Feranmi kept pointing at the same man.
