In 2011 violent Buhari told his supporters in a now viral video, “Ku fita ku yi zabe. Ku kasa. Ku tsare. Ku raka. Ku tsaya. Duk wanda bai yarda ba, ku halaka shi!” Rough idiomatic translation: “Go out and participate in the election. Cast your vote. Protect it. Accompany it (to the collation center). Wait for it (to be counted). All who disagree (with you), kill them!” In the video, his audience gave wild chants in agreement. And scores of people, including “corpers,” were murdered in the north. He wasn’t prosecuted. Sowore hasn’t said anyone be killed, but Buhari’s cowardly DSS operatives are illegally detaining him for “planning” #RevolutionNow. It’s Buhari who should be in jail for instigating the mass murder of innocent people. It was Buhari’s call for mass murder, which led to actual mass deaths, that was the real terrorism. Terrorism is defined as “the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.” Between Sowore and Buhari, who committed terrorism? You be the judge. Source: Facebook
