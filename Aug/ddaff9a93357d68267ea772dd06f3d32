Nigerians have praised Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, for nominating a 27-year-old graduate of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Seun Fakorede, as a commissioner. Mr Fakorede bagged a civil engineering degree in 2016. He was among three commissioner-nominees sent to the state House of Assembly for screening on Monday. Speaker of the House, Adebo Ogundoyin, confirmed Fakorede’s nomination via Facebook. “Let’s clear the air, the Oyo State House of Assembly has received the name of the 27-year-old Seun Fakorede of Ibarapaland as commissioner-nominee from the Oyo State government led by Governor Seyi Makinde,” Ogundoyin wrote. Makinde had on August 15 sworn in 14 commissioners cleared by the assembly. Since his inauguration, Makinde has been the toast of Nigerians, with nearly every decision he makes pleasing the majority. Nigerians on Twitter have now hailed him for the nomination of a 27-year-old as commissioner. This Osun state Governor Seyi Makinde is a man to watch. I hope he keeps it up. He is the new face of Leadership of Oduduwaland. — maxi okwu (@scatter511) August 20, 2019
Seyi Makinde is an unusual kind of governor. In less than 100 days, and everyone is talking about him. You can’t give what you don’t have. He has integrity and we can see it in action. — Arasix services (@Onaarapeter) August 20, 2019

Seyi Makinde has been the only governor to trend more than four times within 100 days in office due to transparency and good governance but the broom that have shook the eyes of the hypocrites won’t let them know @seyiamakinde is the real Mr Integrity. — HAYWHY🔱🔱🔱 (@iam_aydebug) August 20, 2019
Great example is Seyi Makinde Appointing 27yrs as commissioner for Youths, not where even PA or SA is even older or age mate with the Governor. — akanbi ola (@akanbiola1) August 20, 2019
