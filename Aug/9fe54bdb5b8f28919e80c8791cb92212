Sundiata Post reported the arrest of former Presidential candidate, Yele Sowore. Reactions have quickly sprung on social media condemning the arrest over what Sowore planned to be a peaceful protest against bad government. Users on Twitter weren’t shy to express their mis-feelings about the decision. See tweets below: If calling for a revolution is treasonable, at least 70% of Nigerians should be in jail. They have called for it at one point or the other, including those in government now when they were out of government! #FreeSowore ! https://t.co/zbIC2uUcba Nothing could be more daft! Of all the actions to take against a constitutionally and legally backed protest, the last should be an arrest of the convener. #FreeSowore If news report of DSS picking up @YeleSowore is confirmed then those behind his arrest sure did not learn from the past, he just had you were he wants you to be. Now we won't know if #RevolutionNow would have really taken over Nigerian government on Monday. It's now #FreeSowore The right to protest is a fundamental human right the world over, President @MBuhari should #FreeSowore without delay! https://t.co/UcJSN0mItd You don’t need a police permission to carry out a protest. You can INFORM them as a matter of courtesy but PERMISSION? That died in the court sometime back! #FreeSowore https://t.co/pVQzDaMIMn Hang them, poison them, shoot them, jail them … they RISE AGAIN. As long as there is a future to fight for, we will always SPEAK UP. #FreeSowore #RevolutionNow pic.twitter.com/G1NitMXUqe Sowore's arrest will not stop us from protesting on Monday August 5th #RevolutionNow #DaysOfRage #FreeSowore pic.twitter.com/xNyB4LxOkE @MBuhari's Administration has energy to arrest protesters and those who tried their best to fight for justice, no energy to arrest killer herdsmen, no energy to arrest corrupt APC members, no energy to restructure Nigeria.#FreeSowore #FreeDadiyata #RevolutionNow pic.twitter.com/PhLDT2xD3E
