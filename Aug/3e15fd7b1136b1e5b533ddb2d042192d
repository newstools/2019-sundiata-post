By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, on Sunday described the attack on the former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, in Nuremberg Germany as a ‘courageous act’. Recall that Senator Ekweremadu, was yesterday attacked by IPOB members while attending the 2nd Annual Igbo Cultural Festival as a Speaker and special guest of honour at an event organised by the Ndi-Igbo Germany community. He was beaten up and publicly humiliated by suspected IPOB members in a viral video. Reacting in his
official Twitter page, Nnamdi Kanu said the attack is a polite warning. He tweeted, “the
courageous act by IPOB at Nürnberg Germany is a polite warning to those engaged
in selling our collective interest to Fulani caliphate. Nwodo, Igbo governors
are warned.” Meanwhile, the Indigenous
People of Biafra, IPOB, said the attack serves as warning to Nnia Nwodo, Dave
Umahi, Okezie Ikpeazu, Willie Obiano and others to stay away from any public
event abroad unless they want to be humiliated.
