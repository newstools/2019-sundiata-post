I watched the video, on the wall of Foluke Martins, of the heckling and prevention of the operatives of EFCC from raiding the home of Akin Ambode, immediate past governor of Lagos State. Let me make this clear: it was WRONG to prevent an agency of government from carrying out its legitimate duties. However, if those goading Buhari and his bunch of pretenders on want to know, it is an indication that his anti-corruption war has NEVER and will NEVER get the buy-in of the people. It can only be applauded by his giddy supporters. And I will tell you why. Does Ambode have case to answer? Surely he does. In fact, NINETY-FIVE PERCENT of Lagosians believe he does. But NINETY-FIVE PERCENT of that same NINETY-FIVE PERCENT know the raid on his house and his possible subsequently arrest are NEVER to serve any public good. It is a continuation of the war against the former governor which started when the owner of Lagos denied him second term ticket. Check these out: These are just few of many inconsistencies and selectiveness on the part of EFCC. No way it can convince anyone, including Epe people, that it is working for society’s good. And that is why Epe people won’t allow its operatives to touch its “own”. And the loser is our fatherland… Source: Facebook
