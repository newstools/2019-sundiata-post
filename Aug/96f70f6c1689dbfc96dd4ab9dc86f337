He urged motorists to adhere to traffic rules in order to avoid accidents, warning them to avoid overloading and dangerous driving. The commander said that anyone found wanting would be dealt with accordingly. “Our primary concern is to prevent road crashes by mobilising road users to desist from dangerous driving, especially overtaking at sharp bends, among others. “We will also ensure the provision of effective rescue services when the need arises within the period,” he said.
