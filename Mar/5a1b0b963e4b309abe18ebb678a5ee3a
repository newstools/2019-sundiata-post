London – Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missed a 90th minute penalty kick as a scrappy north London derby against Tottenham Hotspur ended in a 1-1 draw on Saturday. Hugo Lloris got down low to keep out the substitute’s poor kick and
rescue a below par Tottenham who had equalised in the 74th minute
through Harry Kane’s penalty kick. Arsenal, bidding to close the gap to their arch-rivals to one point,
had taken the lead in the 16th minute when Aaron Ramsey broke clear
after a mistake by Davinson Sanchez. Kane had a first-half header ruled out for offside, but Tottenham
struggled to create chances as a third English Premier League defeat in
succession for the first time since 2012 loomed. Alexandre Lacazette had wasted a good chance to make it 2-0 to
Arsenal, but it was the man who replaced him, Aubameyang, who cost his
side victory. The Gabonese hit a poorly-struck penalty kick after Sanchez was adjudged to have fouled him. A niggly game ended with Arsenal’s other substitute Lucas Torreira being red-carded for a high tackle on Danny Rose. Tottenham’s first league draw of the season left them third on the table, four points above Arsenal.
