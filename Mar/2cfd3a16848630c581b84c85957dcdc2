Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The People’s Democratic Party (PDP )
has demanded immediate cancellation of the Kano supplementary election reminding
that for its 16 years in power, the party never watered quest for power with blood
of innocent Nigerians as the All Progressives Congress has done in the 2019
general election. The party which informed that INEC is already aware that the
Police arrested the Kano State Commissioner for Special Duties, Muktar Yakasai
alongside APC thugs he led to disrupt election in Yelwa in Dala Local
Government area, disclosed this on Saturday in a statement signed by the
National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan sent to Sundiata Post. Accoording to the party, “All material facts on the
supplementary election in Kano state show that rampaging APC thugs violently
took over polling units, attacked and chased away voters and engaged in massive
thumb-printing and ballot stuffing for the APC. It also informed that INEC is already aware of how APC thugs
attacked voters in polling units in Gama area of Kano state during which four
PDP members were feared killed and many more injured before they carted away
ballot boxes for stuffing for the APC. The party therefore cautioned INEC to note that in this circumstance,
any results they come out with from what it called convoluted electoral process
in the state, will be a sham and will surely be rejected by the people of Kano
state. Stressing that it is completely reprehensible that the APC
and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje would resort to violence and bloodletting as a
means to attempt to hold on to power after they have been rejected by the
people. The PDP therefore charges INEC to save the nation from
crisis by cancelling the Kano Supplementary election, as failure to do so is
not in the best interest of our dear nation.
