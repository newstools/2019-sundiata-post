Africa being the first African fighter to win a UFC title. “I congratulate you on this wonderful feat, for winning this fight not only for Nigeria, but for the African continent. “We are truly proud of you and urge you to continue to use your professional prowess to extol the virtues of Nigerian heritage. “Your shinning beacon serves as inspiration to the Youths of Nigeria,”Dabiri-Erewa said. The Presidential aide urged Usman to continue to use his God given
talent to benefit mankind, especially African youths in the Diaspora. Nigeria is particularly honoured with the post tournament statement
credited to Usman where he said, “Nigeria, I have told them, we will do
it, I told them we never fail. And we have done it today,”. The UFC is the biggest competition in MMA, where competitors combine
boxing, kickboxing, jiu-jitsu, wrestling and other disciplines while
fighting in an octagonal cage. Usman, 31, produced the performance of his career to dominate long reigning welterweight champion Woodley. He extended his winning streak to 14 and maintained his unbeaten record in the UFC. Usman was born in Nigeria, but left Benin City for Arlington in Texas
as a young child when his family migrated to the U.S. (NAN)
