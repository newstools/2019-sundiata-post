Jakarta – Facebook has temporarily banned political ads purchased from outside Indonesia in an effort to combat foreign interference in the country’s upcoming election. The restriction, which took effect on Tuesday, targets any ad that
references politicians or political parties or attempts to encourage or
suppress voting, Facebook said in a statement. “Combating foreign interference is a key pillar of our approach to
safeguarding election integrity on our platform,’’ the social network
said. Incumbent President, Joko Widodo, faces former Gen. Prabowo Subianto
in the April 17 election – a repeat of the 2014 vote, which was marked
by divisive and religiously-charged campaigning. In February, the Russian embassy in Jakarta denied the country was
interfering in the Indonesian election after Joko accused Prabowo’s camp
of engaging in “Russian propaganda’’. The opposition says that after five years in office, the president has a dismal economic record and is too cosy with China. Facebook said it was using a mix of automated and human review to help it identify offending ads. The company said it was setting up an operations centre in Singapore
that focused on fighting false news, hates speech and election
interference. In January, the company removed more than 1,000 Facebook and
Instagram accounts, accusing them of engaging in what it called
coordinated inauthentic behaviour in Indonesia. By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) - Facebook says it will not allow foreign-funded advertisements… By Ismaila Chafe Abuja - President Paul Biya of Cameroon has felicitated with President Muhammadu… APC - 402, 961 PDP - 138, 484
