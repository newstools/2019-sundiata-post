When contacted, the Resident Electoral commissioner (REC), Ebonyi State, Prof. Godswill Obioma, confirmed the incident. In neighbouring Benue State, a primary school containing all electoral materials for Mbalom ward in Gwer East Local Government Area has been set ablaze, according to reports reaching Channels Television. All the electoral materials are said to have been completely destroyed in the fire.
