The rescheduled 2019 JAMB Mock Exam date has once again, clashed with Supplementary Elections date, which has now been scheduled by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be held on the same date of 23rd March, 2019. INEC announced 23rd March 2019 as the new date for supplementary elections in Adamawa, Kano, Bauchi, Plateau, Benue and sokoto states, which were declared inconclusive. This implies that there will be restriction of movement in the affected states, and of course, this would affect the conduct of JAMB Mock Exams in the listed states. As at the time of this report, there has been no word from JAMB on the next line of action concerning the conduct of the Mock on 23rd March in the affected states. We’re still waiting on them. Also, No date has been confirmed by JAMB on the date for commencement of the 2019 Main UTME, neither has a date been confirmed for reprinting of Exam Slips for the Main UTME. Keep visiting the scholar.sundiatapost.com Website for possible reactions by JAMB, which will be posted first here on Myschool. Feel free to get your copy of the JAMB CBT Mobile App and also JAMB CBT Software for Computers, which will help you take several JAMB Mock Exams before the Main UTME. The software and app contain possible questions from the Novel Sweet Sixteen, and all the updated past questions till 2018.
