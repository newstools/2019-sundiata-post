Berlin – Brazil striker Neymar is facing sanctions from European football body UEFA over remarks he made following the elimination of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) from the UEFA Champions League. UEFA, on Wednesday, said a disciplinary investigation has started after the PSG forward criticised in an Instagram post the officiating of the defeat to Manchester United. The English Premier League (EPL) side scored a late penalty kick, awarded following a video review, for a 3-1 win to tie the last 16 encounter. It thus helped them to advance on the away goals rule after a 3-3 aggregate. Neymar, who is currently sidelined with a foot injury, had watched the game from the stands. “It’s a disgrace,’’ Neymar had said in his Instagram post in Portuguese.(dpa/NAN)
