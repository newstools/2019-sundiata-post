When it comes to EMOTIONS, we are WEAKER than we think. You gat to be in his/her shoes, perhaps you’ll be less judgemental! We look at the MORALITY of their actions. Those affected look at the REALITY of their feelings. The feelings are STUPID. They are IMMORAL. They are SOCIALLY and even RELIGIOUSLY INDEFENSIBLE. Perhaps, we might have behaved even worse if we were in their shoes. We never know how weak we are EMOTIONALLY until someone steals that part of our heart that is so vulnerable. And each person has. It takes one person to unlock it. And at times, it might be the WRONG person. And while MORALISTS take us to the cleaners, we always wish they could UNDERSTAND. But a very JUDGMENTAL society hardly understands. At least, not in this part of the world. Don’t know if I am making sense… Source: Facebook
