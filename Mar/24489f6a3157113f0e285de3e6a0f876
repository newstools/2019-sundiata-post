By Temitope Salami Sagamu (Ogun) – A total of 2,395 corps members have been inducted for the  2019 Batch ‘A’ set  National Youth Corps Service (NYSC) orientation exercise in Ogun. Mrs Belinda Faniyi, Ogun NYSC State Coordinator, disclosed this during the swearing-in ceremony of the corps members at the NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp in Sagamu, Ogun on Friday. She said that the figure comprised of 1,229 males and 1,175 females. Faniyi urged the corps members to maintain discipline and uphold national values during the period of the orientation. She said the process of cultural integration for them would commence from the camp through cultural displays about the people of Ogun to facilitate quick integration with the host communities. “Let me remind you that your call to join the vanguard of youths in the service of the fatherland is a noble one; therefore avail yourselves of the opportunities provided by the orientation. “Be the best you can be in line with the enviable and landmark antecedents of Ogun as a ‘Gateway State,” she said. Speaking on her mandate, Faniyi said her utmost priority would be the welfare of corps members and staff of the scheme. She, however, appealed to the state government build more hostels for corps members at the orientation camp. Mr Segun Adesanya, Special Adviser to Ogun Governor on Youths and Sports Development, urged the corps members to take advantage of the scheme for national integration. Adesanya, who represented the governor, added that corps members must demonstrate the ideals of true intellectuals and responsible youths by exhibiting a high level of obedience and discipline. “We need unity and there is no best place to put unity into practice than at the service year. “Here, they will not only mix with their peers from around the country but also integrate with their host communities.” (NAN)
