As information about the Lagos building collapse today continue to emerge, a Twitter user based in Lagos tweeted that a woman lost five of her children in the school building in Ita-Faji, Lagos Island. Recall that we earlier reported that some school children were trapped inside a collapsed building today. More findings reveal that over 100 pupils were said to be in the building when it collapsed. However, 22 persons have been rescued from the three-storey building, while emergency services are on the ground to ensure the rescue of victims.
