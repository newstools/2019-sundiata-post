Uyo – An International Election Observer group, Pan African Women (PAN) projects that monitored the General elections in Nigeria has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the amended electoral Act. Ms Mphoentle Keitseng, the Publicity Secretary of PAN project 2019
who monitored Governorship and House of Assembly elections in Akwa Ibom
made the appeal during an interactive session with newsmen in Uyo on
Wednesday. According to her, the electoral bill will help to facilitate and
regulate a proper conduct of subsequent elections in the country. She noted with dismay that the just concluded governorship and house
of assembly elections were marred with irregularities such as vote
buying, ballot box snatching, intimidation, thuggery and disruption of
voting process. Keitseng harped on the need to review the electoral act in order to help strengthen the electoral process. She called on federal government to create election tribunal in order to prosecute offenders of the electoral processes. Keitseng decried heavy presence of military personnel in polling units which she observed was scaring voters. She advised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to
improve on arrival of materials and election kick off at the
gubernatorial and state of assembly elections. “We commend the transparent and credibility exhibited by INEC in Akwa
Ibom in conducting free, fair Presidential/National Assembly and
Gubernatorial/State House of Assembly elections,” said. Keitseng also advised INEC to recruit ad-hoc staff that were above 30
years of age for sensitive positions as polling officers because as
many polling officials who were young lacked the maturity to take
decisions on time, especially where violence erupted.
