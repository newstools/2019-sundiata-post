Ethiopian Yomif Kejelcha broke the world indoor mile record when he clocked three minutes 47.01 seconds during an invitational meet in Boston on Sunday. The 21-year-old smashed the 22-year-old record of 3:48.45 set by Morocco’s Hicham El Guerrouj in 1997. Kejelcha had come within one hundredth of a second of the record when he clocked 3:48.46 at the Millrose Games in New York last month. The twice world indoor 3,000 metres champion was also targeting the indoor 1,500m record but narrowly missed it with a 3:31.25. That made Kejelcha, who is coached by Alberto Salazar, the third-fastest in the event behind compatriot Samuel Tefera’s February world record of 3:31.04 and El Guerrouj’s 3:31.18 (Reuters) By Edith Ike- Eboh Abuja - The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation says it has no… CAPE TOWN - Olympic 400-metres champion Wayde van Niekerk is unsure whether he will defend… Singapore - Oil prices dipped on Thursday, dragged down by weakening factory output in China…
