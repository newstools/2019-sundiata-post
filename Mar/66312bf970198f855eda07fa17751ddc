Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – All Progressives Congress  governorship candidate in Enugu State, Senator
Ayogu Eze has boycotted the ongoing election in the State. Senator Eze said he could not participate in the exercise after the Independent
National Electoral Commission, (INEC) had failed to publish his name in the
final list of candidates. This is also as
villages laid siege to his house in Umuida, Igbo-Eze North Local Government
Area, demanding that the election should be called off. Addressing the aggrieved villagers, Senator Eze said the INEC shut him out of
the exercise despite a valid court order. He said, “We
are protesting because of the delisting of my name. You can see I’m being held
hostage here by angry voters, who are protesting that INEC has not treated
their candidate fairly. “We are
protesting because of the delisting of my name few days before election and
their inability to put it back, almost 48 hours after they were ordered to do
so by a competent court of law. “They are protesting because they believe that their own candidate is being
excluded and there is no level playing field. They believe that the duty of
INEC is to create a level playing field for all contestants. “All these
people have said they will continue to be here until the INEC does what is
right, number one to reschedule the election in Enugu, number two to put back
my name.”
