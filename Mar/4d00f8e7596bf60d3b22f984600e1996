By Deji Abdulwahab Abuja – An Ecologist, Mr Abdullahi Aremu, has urged the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) to intensify efforts toward enforcing extant waste disposal laws to ensure dirt-free environment in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Aremu, who is the Director-General, Advocacy for Environmental and Sanitation Integrity, an NGO, made the call
in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Wednesday. He said that the board should deal with those who litter the environment with garbage. He added that “in the FCT, particularly in suburbs of Abuja, managing waste has become a major concern in spite of efforts by
government and private organisations in that direction. “That is why it is a common sight today to see heaps of festering waste in many areas of FCT. “Residential apartments, markets, waterways, highways, streets and undeveloped plots of land have been converted into waste
dumpsites for many households.” The ecologists urged residents of the FCT to dispose waste properly to prevent water pollution. He explained that “water pollution can occur from city streets where garbage and chemicals are not disposed properly.” Aremu said that once water was polluted, it would become unsafe for consumption due to the dangerous or toxic materials in it. He added that if contaminated, such water could lead to infections, sicknesses and even death when consumed. “Water pollution has become a growing concern over the last century, as more and more waste is being disposed
into our oceans, rivers and lakes,” he said.
