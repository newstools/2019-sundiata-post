The Vice-Chancellor, University of Ilorin, Prof. Sulyman Abdulkareem, says the institution plans to re-brand into global University through employment of more foreign nationals. Abdulkareem disclosed this on Tuesday while speaking at the interactive session and get-together with international staff organised by the Centre for International Education (CIE). The vice-chancellor said that the university management would continue to do its best to inspire and motivate all staff, particularly, international scholars, in accordance with the Federal Government’s commitment to manpower development. “I foresee a time when the rate of foreign nationals coming to work in this University will become huge just as our staff in foreign universities abroad will also become very huge,” he said. Abdulkareem, who was represented by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Management Services), Prof. Bolaji Sule, said that the contributions of international staff to the growth of the University have never gone unnoticed. He said: “we are not unmindful of the sacrifices you are making for your career in this University that has grown to become a pride of Nigeria and Africa”. The VC said that the University has international staff members as scholars from African countries such as Ghana, Congo, Egypt and Asian countries like Sri Lanka working side by side their Nigerian colleagues to keep the University’s flag flying. “More of these nationals will be employed in years to come to further strengthen our brand as a global University. “I see coming generations of the current international scholars, their biological and academic children, coming back into our midst settling down here, marrying our people, working and retiring here,” the Vice-Chancellor said.
