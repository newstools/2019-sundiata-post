By Oluwafunke Ishola Lagos – The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) has lauded Senator Solomon Adeola, representing Lagos West, for his support in the entrepreneurship and skill acquisition training programme for some 5000 people in the district. Dr Dikko Radda, Director-General of SMEDAN gave kudos to Adeola
during the closing ceremony of the programme for participants drawn from
the 10 local government areas of the Lagos-West senatorial district, on
Thursday in Lagos. Radda said that the training was to instil knowledge and reduce the country’s unemployment and poverty rate. He said some of the participants were trained on cosmetology, fashion designing, plumbing and catering. Others were trained on identification of business opportunities,
business plan development, selling and marketing strategies and
accessing business finance. Radda, represented by Mr Adeyinka Fisher, Lagos Coordinator for
SMEDAN, said starter kits sponsored by Adeola were given to the
participants to become self-reliant. Adeola, on his part, said the training was a form of giving back and
contributing to the development of the community he was representing in
the national assembly. Adeola, represented by Mr Babatunde Rajh-Label, Director-General,
YAYI Campaign Team, said that with a population of about 180 million
persons in Nigeria, youths in the country could no longer look up to
government alone for employment. “We are talking about taking the country to the Next Level, and we
cannot achieve this without empowering the citizens,” he said. Adeola said that the participants would be mentored and given necessary financial assistance to ensure they succeed.
