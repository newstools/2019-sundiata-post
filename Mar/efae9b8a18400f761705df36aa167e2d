statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Dutse on
Friday. Shehu also advised people of the state to continue to be law abiding throughout the period of elections and beyond. “The Jigawa Command of the NSCDC wishes to appreciate the way and
manner the Jigawa State residents conducted themselves during the
Presidential and National Assembly polls. “People went out and exercised their franchise in an orderly manner
as expected without breach of the law, as no arrest was made by the
command during the exercise. “And anyone, who feels aggrieved after, should channel his case
through the already established constituted authority, that’s the
election tribunal, instead of causing breakdown of law and order. “It is on this note that the command wants the public to continue to
be law abiding and exhibit the same level of orderliness during the
forthcoming gubernatorial and state assembly elections and after,” Shehu
