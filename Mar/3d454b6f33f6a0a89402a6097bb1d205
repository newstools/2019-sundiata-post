Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has in a statement signed by its spokesman Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere stated that March 23rd Supplementary elections have been rendered void going by the Judgement of the Osun Governorship election tribunal today. They stated that their statement was a warning to INEC and why tomorrowâ€™s supplementary elections in Bauchi, Kano and Sokoto should be cancelled and PDP candidates declared winner. The Statement read: The Osun Governorship Election Petition Tribunal today held that cancellation of already announced polling unit result by EOs or Returning officers instead of Polling Unit Presiding officers is illegal and null and void .Any result announced and not cancelled by the Presiding officers cannot be cancelled again by anybody. This is part of the principle the tribunal reaffirmed upon which Sen.Ademola Adeleke was declared winner . APC Camp is in trouble as 80 percent of their victory both at the Senate,Governorship and Presidential was gotten with massive cancellation of already announced Polling unit results. The illegal Cancellation of Result by Returning Officers and Electoral officers in Kano especially nasarawa lga, Bauchi especially Tafawa Belawa lga and Sokoto is null and void going by the Judgement of the Osun Governorship Election Tribunal Judgement. 
INEC should save us another waste of public funds and use the polling until result which PDP candidates are already leading and declare ABBA of Kano, Tambuwal of Sokoto , Bala Mohammed of Bauchi , Nyesom Wike of Rivers, Fintiri of Adamawa and Ortom of Benue As Governors Elect.
