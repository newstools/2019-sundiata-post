By
Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Lawmaker representing Katsina South senatorial district, Senator Abu Ibrahim has promised that a system would be created for  periodic review of wages . The Chairman Senate committee on
Employment, Labour and Productivity,  said
this is the  panacea to strikes and
protests over minimum wage by Labour. According to the Senator, the system
will avert strikes and its attendant effect on the economy, occasioned by
strikes by the organised Labour. Senator Ibrahim, who represents
Katsina south senatorial zone made the disclosure while fielding questions from
newsmen in Abuja on Wednesday. “There should be a system
whereby the Federal government and the Labour Union will know the time to
review the minimum wage. “There must be a system that
will determine how much workers will earn periodically, so that system should
be created” Ibrahim said. Speaking on the N30,000 minimum wage
passed by the legislature, “we looked at the difference of what the
executive asked for, it was N3000 and the commotion that it will create. We
brought another solution that the federal government should look into Revenue
allocation to make it possible for states to pay. “So we came with additional
suggestion, after the N30,000 minimum wage, we suggested that the Revenue
allocation should be look into to make the states and the local governments
more viable”. He however disagreed that the upper
legislative chamber was under pressure to pass the 2019 budget, because of time
constraint. “We have close for two weeks
for budget purpose, by two weeks we should finish and go to the main committee
(Appropriation). So by middle of April or May we should have concluded, two
weeks before we close,  so am sure we are not in hurry, we will finish
within time” he said.
