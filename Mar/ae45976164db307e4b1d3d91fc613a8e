He advised all personnel of the Corps to be law abiding and to avoid taking laws into their hands in the name of any vindictive action as the matter was under control. ”There is need to exercise restraint despite the flying tempers among personnel in other to avoid an escalation of the situation. “There is no existing rancour between the Nigeria Police and the NSCDC,” he said. Iyamu also advised personnel to see the police as partners in progress with the mindset for cooperation and synergy towards achieving a common national goal as there was no alternative to peace. ”I appeal to officers and men of the corps to take the incident as an act of God despite the fact that the unjust killing was perpetrated by men of a sister agency,” he said.
