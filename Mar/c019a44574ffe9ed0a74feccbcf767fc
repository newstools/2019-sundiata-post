The Governor of Imo state, Rochas Okoroacha who contested for Imo west senatorial seat has been excluded from the issuance of Certificate of return to Senators-elect. The commission indicated that his declaration as winner of the poll was made under duress by the returning officer. The issuance of Certificate of return is billed to take place on the 14th of March at International Conference Centre in Abuja at 10.00 am for senators-elect and 2.00 pm for Members of the House of Representatives-elect. Bauchi South senatorial seat is also vacant. Although the seat has been allotted to the APC but the authentic owner of the seat is to be determined by the court. The INEC list puts the current composition of the 9th senate per party lines: 62 senators from All Progressives Congress (APC); 37 from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); and 1 from the Young Progressives Party (YPP). The gender composition of the 9th senate also shows that there are six females so far declared winners in the polls.
