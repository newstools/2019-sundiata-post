Meanwhile, the final result is being collated to declare the winner. Earlier in the afternoon on Sunday, Sanusi Bature Dawakin-Tofa, spokesperson to PDP gubernatorial candidate, Abba Kabir Yusuf, had accused INEC and security agencies of ganging up against democracy and warned that any attempt to declare Abdullahi Ganduje as winner would lead to crisis in Kano. The full statement reads: “The PDP Gubernatorial Candidate wishes to appreciate his teeming supporters who participated in the Kano Rerun elections which clearly gave victory to the People Democratic Party. Without your relentless effort our Party would have gotten the winning vote in the first election and the Rerun respectively. “It is very unfortunate to have witnessed a gang up against democracy by the trio of the ruling APC, INEC and the Security agencies who connived attempting to orchestrate broad day light robbery of the People’s mandate. “We want to categorically state that any desperate attempt by the already compromised INEC officials to declare Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje as the winner of this rerun will plunge Kano into an unprecedented political crisis. The attempt would be resisted. “We urge all relevant stakeholders at state and federal government to as a matter of urgency to call the attention of INEC on the need to immediately declare Abba Kabir Yusuf as the winner of the election, being the candidate with the highest votes in the just concluded election. “We also call on security agencies to refrain from being partisan by supporting the ruling party to aid and abate crisis.”
