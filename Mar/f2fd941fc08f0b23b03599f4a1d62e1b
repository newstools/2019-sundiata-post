Senator Oluremi Tinubu has called for gender inclusion as the world marks this year’s international women’s Day. In a statement, she said she’s celebrating especially with Nigerian Women all over the world on the occasion of the International Women’s day, 2019. The statement read:
Beyond the recognition of the struggles and achievements of womenfolk, it is a celebration of womanhood – her strength, resilience, power and doggedness. This year, there are two themes in commemoration of International Women’s Day – ‘Balance for Better’ and “Think equal, build smart, innovate for change.” While both themes may appear to be at variance, they are both pointers to the way forward in the quest for the protection of rights of women and a reminder that we must devise new strategies in the pursuit of gender equity and balance. It is apparent that to adequately entrench the rights of women, abrogate gender based violence and ensure equal opportunities for all, men have a role to play. Conscripting men into gender based discussions and actions will enable us address issues of gender disparity, equality in every strata of life, ensure gender balance in government, employment, remuneration of employees and wealth creation. Thus, I enjoin men to speak up in support of Women. Gender balance will benefit us all and our Nation as a whole. In addition, Women must rise up and equip themselves to fill gaps in Politics, Public Office, and Management. This can only be done if we are all ready to make a difference, speak up for worthy causes and impact on our immediate communities, the type of change we wish to see. Thus, I congratulate you all once again and assure you of my unwavering commitment to the empowerment of Nigerian Women.
