By Polycarp Auta Jos – Mr Ezekiel Afon, a lawmaker representing Pengana Constituency in the Plateau State House of Assembly has died hours after he was re-elected to represent the constituency. Mr Bashir Sati, the Secretary of the All Progressive Congress (APC)
in the state confirmed the lawmaker’s death to the News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Jos. According to Sati, Afon died Sunday afternoon after a brief illness. “It is unfortunate that we lost Afon, one of the most dedicated
members of our party and a committed lawmaker just after he was declared
winner to occupy his seat again. “Though he has been sick for a while but we received the news of his demise with rude shock,” he said. NAN reports that Afon was first elected into the Assembly under the
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2015, but defected to the ruling APC
in 2017.
