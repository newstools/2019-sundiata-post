IGP who also ordered for an autopsy to be conducted, gave the order on Saturday

statement reads in full: The
Inspector General of Police, Ag. IGP M.A Adamu NPM,mni has ordered a
comprehensive and speedy investigation into the circumstances surrounding the
death of the late Ogar Jumbo, an Assistant Superintendent of the Nigerian
Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). While condoling with the family, the Commandant General of the
NSCDC, friends and professional colleagues of the deceased, the IGP reassures
them that everything humanly possible will be done to ensure that justice
prevails in the case. He equally enjoins that the NSCDC along with the family
of the deceased, may, for the purpose of transparency, nominate any medical
doctor of their choice to witness the autopsy, at the appropriate time and
venue. Needless to state that an autopsy, which is a comprehensive forensic
examination on the body of a dead person, will help the investigators to have a
definitive understanding of the real cause of death of the deceased. The IGP therefore calls for calm from the family and friends of
the deceased and the entire public, reiterating that the case will not be swept
under the carpet. ACP
