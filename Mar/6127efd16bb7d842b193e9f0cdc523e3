By Ibrahim Abdulazeez Iseyin (Oyo State ) – The Chairman of  the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, Chief Akin Oke, on Monday said that the party would  not interfere in the leadership elections of the National Assembly. The  chairman made the  disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan. NAN recalls  that some returning members of the Senate and House Representatives in the state had commenced scheming for various leadership positions in  the National Assembly. “Even the president has said that it is the domestic affairs of the National Assembly  and that he will not interfere. “We can’t discourage anyone from contesting but if the party will support anyone it has to be from the national body and  so for now, we are not interfering in the process. “ If members feel they are qualified, they can contest; it  also depends on whether the party will zone some positions or not,”  Oke said. NAN reports that Oyo State has former senate leader, Teslim Folarin and Sen .Abdulfatah Buhari as old members of the upper chamber. Senator-elect, Kola Balogun, is a new member from the state.(NAN)
