Seoul – U.S. and South Korean troops began a reduced joint military exercise replacing the countries’ major springtime war games. In order to aid the push for a diplomatic resolution with North
Korea, a U.S. Defence Department spokesman Acting U.S. Secretary of
Defence Patrick Shanahan said on Monday in Seoul. Joint “Dong Maeng’’ exercises will be held until March 12, Seoul’s
joint Chiefs of Staff and the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command
(CFC) said in a statement. “Dong Maeng’ which means ‘Alliance’ in English, has been modified
from the previously held spring exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle and
will focus on strategic, operational and tactical aspects of general
military operations on the Korean Peninsula,’’ the statement said. “These exercises are crucial in sustaining and strengthening the
alliance,’’ Seoul’s chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Park
Han Ki and CFC Commander General Robert B Abrams said. Seoul’s Defence Minister Jeong Kyeong Doo and Shanahan agreed on
Saturday that the “Key Resolve’’ and “Foal Eagle’’ exercises would no
longer take place. The Pentagon said the decision reflected a joint “desire to reduce
tension and support our diplomatic efforts to achieve complete
denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula in a final, fully verified
manner.’’ U.S. President Donald Trump has criticised the exercises, describing
them as “very expensive’’ and “provocative’’ to North Korea, while
Pyongyang has slammed the manoeuvres as being part of plans to invade
it. The latest announcement comes after Trump left empty-handed from his
highly-anticipated summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in
Vietnam. By Edeki Igafe Warri(Delta) - Former Governor of Delta, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan, has called for… Johannesburg - Shares in MTN Group fell as much as 5.4 per cent on Friday,… CAPE TOWN - Cricket South Africa have not renewed the contracts of frontline spinner Imran…
