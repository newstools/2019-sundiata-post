JAMB’s spokesperson, Fabian Benjamin, said these changes are due to ”certain circumstances beyond the Board’s control” and that  “All candidates who registered for the 2019 UTME are to ensure that they print their examination notification slips before the day of the examination as no excuses would be entertained. The public should note that the Board would not reschedule examination for any candidate,” he said.
