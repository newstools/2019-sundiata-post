By Sylvester Thompson Abuja – Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, President of Court of Appeal on Wednesday in Abuja, urged chairmen and members of Election Petition Tribunals to dispense justice in accordance with the law without delays. Bulkachuwa, made the call at the induction ceremony for Justices of
the Court of Appeal, Chairmen and members of election petition tribunal,
held at the Mohammed Uwais Mediation Centre. She urged the justices to discharge their duties without fear or
favour, affection or ill-will within the dictates of their conscience
and oath of office. “The judiciary has been a major role player in the sustenance of
democracy in Nigeria by adjudicating in all cases that arise from
pre-election and post-election activities. “I want to remind the judges that the assignment ahead of them is
enormous and as such, due diligence and professionalism is expected from
them. “Time is of essence in election petition tribunal and you should desist from granting frivolous adjournments,’’ she said. Bulkachuwa told the judges to discourage the practice of employing
undue technicalities or act capable of causing delay in dispensation of
petitions before them. “Each and every one of you will be closely monitored by my office and
I will not hesitate to descend on any judge found wanting in the
discharge of his or her duties,’’ she said.
