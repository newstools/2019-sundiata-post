By Tukur Muntari Kano – Abba Kabir-Yusuf, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate for Kano State, says he remains the party’s flag bearer in spite of the court ruling that nullified the PDP governorship primary. Kabir-Yusuf made the claim in a statement signed by his spokesman,
Sanusi Bature Dawakin-Tofa, issued to newsmen in Kano on Monday. He said, “The court ruling today (Monday) does not in any way affect
the candidature of Engr. Abba Kabir-Yusuf as the case is against the
People Democratic Party (PDP), which we believe that the party has taken
the most appropriate action of appeal. “As far as we are concerned, our campaign activities will continue
till Thursday night, March 8 when the deadline of campaigns will elapse
as contained in the Electoral Act 2010 as amended.” According to him, the case had nothing to do with him as the party
flag bearer, but an internal issue the party had taken step to resolve. The governorship candidate urged his teeming supporters to remain
calm and continue with the electioneering campaigns to ensure victory
for the party on Saturday.(NAN) By Tukur Muntari Kano - Barely five days to the governorship election, a Federal High… By Abbas Bamalli Kano - The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano State has rejected… By Yakubu Uba Yola - The governorship candidate of Peoples Democratic Party in Adamawa, Alhaji…
