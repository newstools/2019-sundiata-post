By Gabriel Yough Jalingo – Alhaji Ibrahim El-Sudi, the Chairman of the All progressives Congress (APC)  Taraba chapter on Wednesday said Alhaji Sani Abubakar remained the party’s governorship candidate in the state. El-Sudi, who was reacting to a Federal High Court order earlier in the day in Jalingo which disqualified Abubakar on the grounds of falsification of age, said that the same case had been determined and dismissed by a superior court in 2007. The Chairman noted that the party’s team of lawyers were already moving to appeal the “mischievous judgement”. He urged the party supporters to continue with their campaign for the Saturday’s governorship polls to ensure victory for the party. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a Federal High Court sitting in Jalingo Presided over by Justice Stephen Pam had issued an order on Wednesday directing the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and APC not to recognize Abubakar as a governorship candidate. A copy of the judgement obtained by NAN reveals that Mr Usman Udi, Mr Joshua Paaku, Mr George Geofrey and Alhaji Muslim Munkaila had approached the court on Jan 9, asking it  to disqualify Abubakar on the grounds of falsification of his date of birth. “It is hereby declared that the information contained in the affidavit Abubakar supporting his personal particulars that he was born on Feb 14, 1968 is in conflict with his date of birth contained in the West African Senior School Certificate he submitted to INEC,” the court noted.
