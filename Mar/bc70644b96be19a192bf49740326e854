Abdullahi Shugaba Dutse – A Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in jigawa, Alhaji Ishaq Hadejia, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari not to re-appoint ministers that have not performed credibly well in their constituencies. Hadejia gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Dutse on Thursday. He noted that it was because of the trust and confidence in Buhari that the masses re-elected him for a second term during the just concluded elections. “Going by this, I am of the view that any minister who doesn’t have the trust and confidence of his people, the President should not re-appoint him or her in the journey to the “Next Level”, “Some of these ministers are hostile and isolated themselves from their people, they are not even participating fully in the campaign for the re-election of APC for a second term. “Now that the masses have again voted Buhari for a second term, he should avoid appointment of relatives and friends into his cabinet.” The APC chieftain also advised the President to always consult state governments before the appointment of ministers. “I can tell you that there are series of complaints from state governors including party chieftains that they were never consulted before appointments of ministers were made at the top.” Hadjia said.
