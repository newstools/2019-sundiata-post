By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Former President, Dr Goodluck Jonathan has described as false the rumour making rounds that he has quit the People’s Democratic Party. Jonathan who said the fabrication was borne out of mischief, debunked the rumour on Sunday in a statement signed by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze sent to Sundiata Post. The statement reads in full: Our attention has been drawn to a fake story published by an unknown website, alleging that former President Dr Goodluck Jonathan has quit the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Obviously,  this is a fabrication  borne out of mischief as the publishers of the fake story claimed that the former President  made the statement while being  interviewed by Nigeria News Agency, (NNA). There is absolutely  no way the former President could have spoken to a non-existent news agency, as none in the country goes by that name. For the avoidance of doubt,  Dr.  Jonathan has no reason at this time to resign his membership of PDP,  the party under which platform he became Deputy Governor,  Governor,  Vice President and President. Those who derive pleasure in spreading fake information had better occupy themselves with more productive endeavours that are obviously more  relevant to nation building.
