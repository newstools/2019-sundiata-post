Comedienne and actress, Helen Paul, has revealed her excitement at being the first Nigerian stand-up comedian to bag a PhD. The 41-year-old expressed her feelings in an Instagram post on Friday.“Can’t wait to wear my beautiful gown on Thursday. Special thanks to University of Lagos, for finding me worthy of this great position as the first Nigerian stand – up comedian to have a PhD (Please argue with the gods) #helenpaul #drhelenpaul.” She also
sent thanks to her supervisor and husband for all their support during the
process adding that her convocation was on the 4th of April. Helen Paul began her career as a freelance and full-time
presenter at several media houses in Nigeria. These include Lagos Television
(LTV 8), Continental Broadcasting Service (CBS), and MNet. As a comedian, her first professional performance happened
whilst she was a student at the University of Lagos. She attended an event with
a group of friends but the stand-up comic billed to perform failed to show up. Helen has won several awards including African Film Award, Exquisite
Lady of the Year Award, Female TV Presenter of the Year and Outstanding
TV female presenter. (Qed.ng)
