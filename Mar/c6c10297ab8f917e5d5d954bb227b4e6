By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Retired Assistant Inspector (AIG) of Police, Dr. Charles Ugomuoh, a retired Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG) and former senatorial candidate, has advised the Imo State governorship candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Senator Hope Uzodinma and Action Alliance (AA), Uche Nwosu to sheath their sword and support Sir Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), whom he said won the election fair and square. Ugomuoh, who said there was no need to dissipate energy and state resources on a wild goose chase challenging Ihedioha’s victory, reminded Nwosu and Uzodinma that the much-touted argument about 25% of votes cast in two-thirds of the Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state to malign the professor who diligently carried out the election duties in Imo State is nothing but a a bad loosers’ syndrome and cannot be sustained. He stressed that the Imo State returning Officer, Prof Francis Otunta who returned Ihedioha is an erudite professor of mathematics, a first class degree holder in mathematics from the University of Benin and Vice Chancellor of Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike. Ugomuoh said Otunta followed due process and deserved praise for an assignment that was well executed. He disclosed this on Friday in a statement he personally signed and sent to Sundiata Post. The retired AIG, therefore, called on the AA and APC candidates to accept the reality of their defeat and move quickly to congratulate and embrace Hon. Ihedioha and help him actualise his plan to deliver good governance he has promised Ndi Imo. Recall that Ihedioha pulled the highest number of votes of 273,404 to beat his closest rival, Uche Nwosu with a vote difference of 82,040.
