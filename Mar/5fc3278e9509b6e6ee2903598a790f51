By Jessica Onyegbula Abuja – Dr Uzodinma Adirieje, Chairman, National World Malaria Day Committee, has called on Nigerians to join hands with the Federal government to boost the success of the fight against malaria in the country. The Federal Government on Saturday, called on Nigerians to join hands in the fight against malaria in the country. Adirieje made the call at a Pre-World Malaria Day news briefing on Saturday in Abuja. According to him, one out of four persons infected with malaria globally is a Nigerian, noting that Nigeria is sitting on top of high burden countries for malaria. He said: “We must do things differently, if we expect to get the needed results; but at the heart of it all is citizen participation. “Nigeria has what it takes to mobilise resources to control diseases and end malaria. “Individuals, the private sector, government and civil society organisations are working toward achieving that.” The chairman said that eliminating malaria required prompt approach, adding that everybody must play a part even at the household level. Adirieje said the World Malaria Day, which will be marked on April 25, gave the committee a platform to exhibit and educate the public on the dangers associated with the disease. “The essence of the World Malaria Day is to create awareness on the dangers of the disease, and the importance of accessing available interventions,” he said. Adirieje noted that the theme for this year’s celebration is: “Zero Malaria starts with me- Join me, so we can all end malaria for good in Nigeria.” He said that if the disease is eradicated, money spent on drugs and hospital services would be channelled into something else. The chairman, therefore, urged Nigerians to maintain proper hygiene, avoid stagnated water and keep their environment clean at all times. (NAN)
