Bridal photos of singer and songwriter Chidinma Ekile are making the rounds on social media with her admirers licking their lips over them. Many have taken the pictures to be her wedding photos but that’s not true. She is only showcasing them to promote the business of a fashion company, Enzoani. Enzoani is an American based bridal brand that emerged in 2006, and quickly rose to compete with top brands by merging traditional and modern European styles into exquisitely handcrafted gowns. The 27-year old is single and it’s not clear if she is seeing someone. She has been rumoured to be romantically linked with Kiss Daniels and Flavour Nabania. In 2010, she rose to stardom after winning the third season of Project Fame West Africa. See more images below:
