By Edeki Igafe Koko (Delta) – Former Delta Governor, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan, on Saturday expressed optimism that the All Progressives Congress (APC) would emerge victorious in the Saturday’s governorship and assembly elections. Uduaghan said this shortly after he cast his vote at about 12:05 a.m. in his hometown, Abigborodo in Warri North Local Government Area of Delta. ‘‘We are optimistic of winning the election but let me get the reports first because I don’t know what is happening in other areas. ‘‘I do not know whether people are behaving or misbehaving or there are security challenges in other areas.  So, it is difficult to give verdict but I am optimistic,’’ he said. Uduaghan commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the early arrival of voting materials in Abigborodo On the security beefed up in Sapele, the former governor said it might not be unconnected with the violence in the last Presidential and National Assembly elections in which two persons were allegedly killed. ‘‘I think the security is tighter in these elections because of what happened in the previous elections. ‘‘The security agencies usually evaluate what is on ground based on information and of course, intelligence report. ‘‘So, maybe the security arrangement this time was because of the previous experience,’’ he said. Uduaghan, however, expressed joy at the turnout of voters. (NAN)
