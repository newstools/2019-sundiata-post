By Ayodeji Alabi Akure – Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Monday lifted the restriction on  vehicular and human movement placed on Oba Akoko in Akoko South West Local Government Area of the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Akeredolu had ordered the restriction in  Oba-Akoko on Saturday evening due to the violence during  Saturday’s  House of Assembly election. But Akeredolu lifted the restriction order after Oba Nurudeen Adegoroye, the Oloba of Akoko and his chiefs appealed to him in his office in Akure during a visit. The governor, however,  warned that the state government would not condone any act of criminality. “You want to support your son or daughter, do so legitimately. If they win, fine. Don’t go and commit crime because of election. “If there are other communities in the state who are dreaming of wanting to perpetuate any act of criminality, let them know we will be decisive. “ Any purveyor of violence will be dealt with henceforth in this state,’’ he said. Adegoroye, in a letter of apology, had expressed sadness over the incident that led to the restriction order. He said the community was subjected to  untold hardship and urged the governor to lift the suspension order. “The truth is that Oba-Akoko has always been peaceful and law-abiding, but we are taken by surprise by this incident and we want you to know that we don’t condone such unrest. “It is on this note, that we appeal to you, sir, to lift the restriction imposed on this community, because the hours to which this town has been under restriction has created untold hardship on the town. “Socio-economic activities and progress within the community have been retarded;  no doubt, we regret this incident and we appeal to you, once again, to lift the restriction for the sake of the pregnant women, the aged and others,’’ he said.
