Commenting on the development, Mr Chris Iwarah, Corporate Communications Manager, Air Peace, said the airline was working towards consolidating on its achievements in 2019. He said: “We are expanding our routes so that people have more options. Areas people don’t normally will not go to, this year, we are planning to go there. “In 2018, we opened many routes both regional and domestic. “They included Asaba, Yola and Kano; we have also expanded our operations to  the Murtala Muhammed Airport 2 to meet the demands of our customers,’’ he said. Also, Capt. Ado Sanusi, Managing Director, Aero Contractors Ltd., appealed to the Federal Government to look inwards into the aviation industry to make sure that it is put on the front burner. Sanusi said this would enable Nigeria to reap from the benefits of aviation in the economy. He said: “You can see what the aviation industry has done to the economy of many countries. “You can look at what RwandAir is doing to the Rwandan economy and you can look at Emirates Airlines and see what it has done to the economy of the United Arab Emirates. “So, you can see what airlines are doing for the economies of their countries and I believe that the federal government should look inwards that developing aviation is key to the success of the economy,’’ Sanusi said.
