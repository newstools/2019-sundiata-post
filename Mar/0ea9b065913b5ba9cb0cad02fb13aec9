Lagos State government debunked claim that a fresh building collapse occurred on Monday in the state, with people trapped in respect of a structure on 57, Egerton Square, Oke Arin on Lagos Island. Several reports online, including videos had indicated that another building had collapsed on Lagos Island. In one of the videos circulating, an eye-witness, who identified himself as chairman of Community Development Association (CDA) in the area, claimed that the building, which was among those marked for demolition, was being demolished by some men when suddenly it collapsed, injuring two people. General Manager, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Adesina Tiamiyu, who spoke in reaction to the various reports, said that no building ever collapsed as being peddled. According to him, what happened was that officials of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), were demolishing the said building on Egerton Square, and in the process a scavenger got injured while trying to pick up something from the building. Also, LASBCA officials, who were at the scene, corroborated him, saying there was no collapsed building and that actually a scavenger got injured while trying to pick up something while the said building was being pulled down. LASBCA Public Affairs Officer, Titi Ajirotutu, who also on the issue when contacted, dismissed various online reports of a collapsed building, saying that the said building was under demolition and that only one person who was trying to pick up something from the building was seriously injured.
