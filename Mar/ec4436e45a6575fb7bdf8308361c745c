Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that his
criticism of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration is not borne
out of hatred. He stated this on Tuesday during an
event to mark his 82nd birthday anniversary held at the Obasanjo
Presidential Library in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. “Buhari; there is nothing personal between me and him … I am his boss, with all due respect,” the elder statesman said. He added, “The point is that I have been in that position longer than any Nigerian will ever be there.” The former president explained that he was only criticising the
programmes and policy of the present administration to ensure that
things were done according to democratic norms. He noted that
while anybody could be in the President’s position, the purpose of
criticism was to deepen democracy and ensure economic growth and
development of the nation. Obasanjo said, “You see that in a
democracy, to criticise a policy of government is not a family affair;
even if it is my brother that is there and is not doing the things that I
believe he should do, he must be criticised. “That is what
democracy is all about. So, if I say anybody in government in Nigeria or
any government in Africa is not doing well, let that government prove
that it is doing well; it is not taking things personally,” he
reiterated. The former president further called on African leaders
to focus more on democracy, good governance and the growth of the
economy for the good of the people. According to him, those who keep quiet in an environment where there is not development are accomplices in the crime. The
elder statesman had criticised President Buhari at different occasions,
one of which he accused the President of returning the country to the
‘Abacha era’.  By Olawale Jokotoye Abeokuta - The Alake and Paramount Ruler of Egbaland, Oba Aremu Gbadebo,…
