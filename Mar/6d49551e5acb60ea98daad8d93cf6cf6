The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the health screening

Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu and Mrs Oluremi Hamzat, respectively, who presided
over the medical outreach programme, appealed to residents to vote
en-masse for all APC candidates during the March 9 elections. Also speaking at the event, Majority Leader, Lagos State House of
Assembly, Mr Sanai Agunbiade, appealed to Lagos residents to ensure
victory for all APC candidates in the upcoming polls. Agunbiade urged the residents to vote in a correct manner to reduce the number of void votes during the election. Also speaking at the venue, the Chairman, Ikorodu Local Government,
Mr Wasiu Adeshina, commended residents for coming out in their numbers
to check their health status. Adeshina stressed the importance of health, reminding them that
health is wealth and foundation of any meaningful socio-economic
development in any society. According to the council boss, good health care system in a society
gives rise to a formidable labour force which in turn lead to a viable
economy. “It is wise for anybody above 40-years of age to engage in frequent
medical checkup for the purpose of maintaining their health, prevention
and treatment of disease. Mrs Sherifat Shokunbi, one of the beneficiaries, commended the
council boss and the APC governorship candidate for the initiative. She urged them not to limit the benefit to only election period, but
to make it a continuous exercise for more people to benefit. (NAN)
