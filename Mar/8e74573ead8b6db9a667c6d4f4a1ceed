By Vivian Ibobo Ikeja – A businessman, Saheed Adesina, appeared in an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday for allegedly swindling a company of N350, 000. Adesina, 56, residing at No. 9,
Dauda St., Coker Village in Orile- Iganmu, Lagos, is charged with two
counts of obtaining under false pretence and stealing. The Police Prosecutor, Insp. Raji
Akeem, told the court that Adesina committed the offences sometime in
May, 2012 at Murhi International Television (MITV) premises at Alausa,
Ikeja. He said that Adesina collected the money from MITV for the supply of tiles, “a representation Adesina knew was false. “Adesina diverted the money to his personal use after he promise the company to deliver the tiles within a week. “The offence contravened the
provisions of Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State,
2015,’’ the prosecutor stated. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
reports that Section 287 stipulates seven-year imprisonment for
stealing, while Section 314 prescribes a 15-year jail term for false
pretence. Adesina, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Magistrate, Mrs O.A. Layinka, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N100, 000 with two sureties in like sum. She ordered that the sureties must
be gainfully employed and should show evidence of two years tax payment
to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned to April 9 for hearing.
