Tbilisi – Authorities in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia on Wednesday announced two men had been apprehended trying to sell a radioactive isotope of uranium for 2.8 million dollars. “The men, found in possession of more than 40 grammes of uranium-238, face up to a decade in prison for illegal handling and sale of nuclear material. “The seized substance poses life and health hazards,’’ Georgia’s State Security Service said in a statement. A video of the bust showed authorities handling the radioactive material with tweezers and surgical gloves. According to the statement, the men, both Georgian citizens, were suspected of operating in the Black Sea resort town of Kobuleti. (dpa/NAN)
