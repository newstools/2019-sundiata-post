Thugs hired by politicians in Kaduna State have attacked journalists in the state including DAILY POST correspondent, Amos Tauna. The journalists on duty to cover the governorship and State Assembly election were attacked with their phones, cameras and other personal belongings seized and destroyed. The incident happened very close to Zonkwa Police Station in the state. Mr. Tuana, who managed to escape the deadly attack with wounds all over his body, complained that, “Myself and a colleague from Radio Nigeria were attacked closed to Zonkwa police station. They took away some of our phone and other valuables.” The newsmen were beaten to stupor for trying to record and report irregularities being perpetrated by the politicians and their thugs.
