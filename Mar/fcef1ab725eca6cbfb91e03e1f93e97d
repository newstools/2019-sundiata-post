Indeed the cane don tire and what a delightsome way to retire it. Hers
is one of those few stories that have happy endings. But, beyond the goodwill,
scholarships, promises, cash donations, invitation to the Presidential villa as
well as the drama and all that has trailed that gripping viral video, the question
is – what about the several other kids like Success Adegor? What about them? Several
who have been sent home. Several who were perhaps, angrier and much more bitter
but not fortunate enough to have someone film and make it viral. Many who have
not had the good fortune of having their stories told. Then
again, is it not most ridiculous that it took that video to expose the state of
primary school education in government schools in Delta state; a government
that prides itself on infrastructural development? At
what point would government at all levels in Nigeria begin to take education seriously?What
about the economy? Success’s parents in oil rich Sapele in Delta state are
obviously poor. That, however, is the story of many Nigerians today. They live
below poverty line. Else, why should their little girl be embarrassed on
account of N800 examination levy?The girl’s stance and attitude in the clip
showed she was used to being sent home for owing fees. Notwithstanding, she was
extremely upset. Thankfully, her prophesy has been fulfilled, the cane don tire! Her life has been changed
forever. For
any parent to send his or herward to a school as hideous as Okotie Eboh Primary
School 1, Sapele, means they have no alternative. This equally means that
beyond the diverse supportSuccess is presently enjoying, our institutions need
to be strengthened. Swiftly,
the State Government has commenced face-lift at the school.Delta State Commissioner for Education, Barr. Chiedu Ebieacknowledged
that they are yet to fix all the schools, but was quick to state that the Okowa
led administration since assumption of office has built and reconstructed over 4,000
classroom blocks and provided furniture, learning and instructional materials to
public schools in the state with a view to making them conducive and
competitive with the private schools. Well said, but what a time to reel out a
curriculum vitae. Distressed by the
incident, renowned economist, Dr. Pat Utomi in a statement said:“You would expect shame to overcome the
machinery of government in Delta for being incompetent to manage the school
system as exposed by Success. But not the Delta State Government; they had
become numb to shame or unable to understand the implication of the face-off
Success had come to symbolise.” Ozioma Izuora, a
legal practitioner put it this way: “But shame on our government! That it
should take the humiliation of a minor for a school building to be getting
refurbished!In my time as a teacher there used to be inspectors going around to
monitor what goes on in the schools. An illegal fee is something they should
have been able to pick up on monitoring…. “Our education has
gone to the dogs!In modern educational thought, supervision
is a phase of administration with particular emphasis on the products of
teaching and learning activities. Educationaladministration
and supervision are
regarded as the total processes inclusive of all responsibilities and functions
necessary for running a school.” Similarly, Chinedu Anarado, Project Manager at eHealth
Africa said: “It is sad that
every time you encounter Nigeria’s system, you are convinced that we will
continue to play catch up to serious economic and innovation blocs of the
world. It seems we will continue to feed off their progress, at great
disadvantage to our own growth and development. Our efforts have never been
about innovations or leveraging modern technology, but deepening the outdated models
we have been used to while delinquently squandering the resources we could have
deployed for innovative growth.” Eulogising the
social media for this feat, another attorney, Ogechi Abu noted that this is a
most potent means to expose people in authority who exploit their privileged
positions. Some insist that
Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has broken the jinx of underdevelopment. They
insist there is no local government in the state which is not experiencing one
form of development or the other and that over 296 roads have been constructed
in all parts of the state. Yet, Delta, one of the richest states in Nigeria, is
among the most undeveloped. Its cities including Sapele and Warri despite the
presence of multinational oil companies are nothing close to modern. The
squalor, unemployment and huge waste of human capital is alarming. One begins
to wonder, what happens to all those monthly allocations? Delta State, carved out of the former
Bendel State on August 27, 1991has
for many years, and alternating with Akwa Ibom and Rivers, received the most
allocation based on the 13 percent derivation. This implies that Delta state
with a little overfour million population receives more money than Lagos and
Kano with their nine million population (2006 Census figures). This also
indicates thatunder the right circumstance, the average Delta personshould
havedouble the money a Lagosian or someone from Kano ought to from the revenue
sharing. Link that to the fact that the state plays host to several oil
companies who actually have a budget to develop their host communities; an enormous
budget, as well as the fact that its soil has nourishedNigeria by growing
timber and rubber. Then you will want to know why Delta state is not competing
with Dubai. Data obtained from a
series of reports from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), disclosed that
oil-producing states in Nigeria received N7.006 trillion as payments under the
13 per cent Derivation principle over the last 18 years, from 1999 to 2016. The
oil producing states are Akwa-Ibom, Rivers, Delta, Cross River, Edo, Bayelsa,
Abia, Ondo, Imo, Anambra, and of recent, Lagos State. In first quarter of
2018, Niger Delta statesshared N593.1b. Four SouthSouth states were the highest
earners from the Federation Account, according to the breakdown of the monthly
Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) report for the first quarter of
the year.The oil producing states of Akwa Ibom (N50.880b), Delta (N49.430b)
Rivers N42.740) and Bayelsa (N38.890b) earned the highest. For the past 28
years Delta has received all manner of monetary allocations but not in any way
close to Lagos, least of all Dubai in terms of advancement. From a backward
fishing town, it took the discovery of oil in in 1966 and a deliberate desire
for positive change to transform Dubai to what it is today. In the 1990’s the famous Sheikh
Rashid highway had been introduced. Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC)
was inaugurated in 2002 following spur of other investments like Media City,
Internet City and so on. By year 2000, it had carved a name for itself for
being known for its successful building projects. Within this period, Delta (created
in 1991) had received allocations running into billions of naira for about nine
years; enough to make it a city befitting of its oil production and revenue
received. Despite its huge
allocations whichovershadowed both Lagos and Kano’s,rivalled only by Akwa Ibom and
Rivers, there is nothing admirable or visible about development in Delta state.
Roads and other
public utility infrastructure are indreadfulconditions.Abandoned projects and
an unrelenting culture of mismanagement and misappropriation of public funds
persist. This is a position Dr. Utomi identifies with as he has often
said the state had more than enough revenues to give qualitative education,
health and infrastructure to the people and to power agriculture endowment
value chains and alleviate poverty. To sum up, here are more of his words:“That
all is not well with how Delta is governed has become clear with the Success
resistance video; that story of the little girl who bravely said no more, with
a steely determination.” Hers
