By Salisu Sani-Idris Abuja – Sheikh Yahya Al-Yolawi, the Chief Imam of Area 10 Garki Jumma’at Mosque, has admonished Muslim men against handshaking, hugging and kissing women apart from their wives. Al-Yolawi gave the advice while delivering his Jumma’at Sermon on: “The evil consequences of fornication and adultery (Zina)’’ on Friday in Abuja. The cleric also urged Muslims to keep away from anything that could stimulate sexual desire like watching pornography, sexy pictures and movies with the opposite sex who is not their wife.According to him, Islam as a religion is very much concern of establishing decent moral standard in individuals within the community, thus constituted many laws that promote chastity and regulate strong sexual desires. He said that fornication and adultery are forbidden and classified as major and destructive sins, adding that Islam has forbidden not only committing fornication but everything that can lead to it. Al-Yolawi said that an adulterer was one of the three people Allah would not talk to on the day of resurrection. “There are three people to whom Allah, the Most High will not talk to, nor will He forgive them of sins nor look at them: an aged person guilty of adultery; a king who lies and a poor beggar who is proud. “Allah the most High says: And do not come close to unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way.’’ The cleric listed some of the religious, social, economic and health consequences of fornication to include poverty, incessant killings, constant humiliation and disgrace, darkness of the heart and being affected with HIV and AIDS. Al-Yolawi, therefore, appealed to government at all levels to adopt strategies to eliminate rising cases of prostitution and indecent dressing in public places to reduce temptation in the society.
