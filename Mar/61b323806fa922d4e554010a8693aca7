By Joy Mbachi Enugwu-Ukwu – Mr Valentine Ayika, former Anambra State House of Assembly has described the just concluded  House of Assembly elections in the state as a black day for democracy. Ayida made the claim in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria
(NAN) on Sunday in Enugwu-Ukwu Community in Njikoka Local Government
Area of the State. “The election was characterised by highest bidder in buying and
selling of votes with lots of materials inducement freely happening
within the voting areas,’’ he said. Ayika said that it was unfortunate that most politicians still
engaged in vote buying in spite of all the electoral education
condemning the act as a counterproductive on development of democracy in
the nation. He said that the House of Assembly elections in the state was
characterised by voter apathy because of the events that played out
after the general elections of Feb. 23. Ayika said that a total overhauling of the country’s electoral
process was needed if the process would be effective in bringing the
right leaders. He said that the new electoral reform bill needed to be signed into
law where the electoral process from the point of accreditations would
be monitored up to the point of actual voting. “I am looking forward to great reforms in our political map where
people with credibility, not money bags will be in the helm of affairs
in the country,” he said. NAN reports that Ayika was elected in the just concluded general
election  of Feb. 23 as the Federal lawmaker to representing Njikoka
Anaocha and Dunkofia  Federal Constituency.
