By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The election tribunal sitting in Abuja has ruled against the petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party and its Presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar asking that the tribunal compel INEC to grant access to conduct forensic analysis on election materials used during the February 23, 2019, polls. The tribunal said such request was beyond the scope of the provisions of Section 151(1) & (2) of the Electoral Act (as amended). The tribunal however, in a unanimous ruling granted them the permission to inspect the materials and obtain certified true copies (CTC) of the materials. Sundiata Post recalls that the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and his party rejected the declaration of Muhammadu Buhari as the winner of the February 23 presidential election. The party which alleged that president Buhari and ruling All Progressives Congress robbed it of victory, had on Monday filed a petition challenging the declaration.
