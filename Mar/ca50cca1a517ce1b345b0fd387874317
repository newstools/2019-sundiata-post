By Emmanuel Oloniruha Abuja – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has petitioned the National Judicial Council over the exparte order stopping the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from concluding the governorship election in Bauchi State. A statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, on Wednesday, disclosed that the petition was filed in an affidavit sworn to by the PDP’s National Chairman, Mr Uche Secondus, in Abuja. On Tuesday, a Federal High Court in Abuja barred INEC from resuming the collation and announcement of governorship election result in Bauchi. Justice Inyang Ekwo issued the order following an ex parte
application filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Bauchi
state Governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
The party, barely 24 hours after rejecting the order,
described the exparte order issued by Justice Ekwo  as a violation of
the Constitution and Electoral Act, accusing the judge of sitting on a
matter that ought to have been handled by an election petition tribunal.  Mr Festus Okoye, INEC’s National Commissioner, Information and Voter
Education, on Tuesday in Abuja told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
that the commission had filed a ‘motion on notice`, challenging the
jurisdiction of the court in granting the order. ” The motion has not been taken. Until that motion is taken, the
court order barring us from collating the result of Tafawa Balewa area
subsists,” he said. Okoye said that though the commission had stopped the collation of
the governorship result, the collation process would continue in the
state assembly elections in the affected areas.
