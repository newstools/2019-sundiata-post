JoyMbachi Awka – Mr Nnamdi Onukwuba, the Anambra Commissioner for Lands, has appealed to the electorate in the state to vote for candidates of All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) in the House of Assembly election on March 9. Onukwuba made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Akwa on Monday. He said that Gov. Willie Obiano needed to consolidate on the democracy structures he started in the state. He called on community leaders across the state to mobilise support
for APGA candidates in the House of Assembly election to sustain the
prevailing peace being enjoyed by citizens. Onukwuba said that an APGA dominated legislature would guarantee
uninterrupted good governance and delivery of democracy dividends in the
state. He said  that APGA government had in the past 13 years proven that
the party was people-oriented as evidenced by the consistent and steady
improvements in the socio-economic well being of the people. The commissioner said that the development in the state would be
sustained if a healthy relationship existed between the legislature and
executive. He advised party faithful to embark on door-to-door campaign to
ensure another resounding victory for the party in the March 9 election. The commissioner appealed to the electorate to consider what the
governor had been doing in the state and support his development plans
for the state. By Akeem Abas Ibadan - Gov. Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State has described President Muhammadu… By Chukwuemeka Opara Abakaliki - The Muslim community in Ebonyi, widows association and market women… APC - 402, 961 PDP - 138, 484
