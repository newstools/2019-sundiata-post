 New permanent Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has made it clear that complacent players will be sold. Solskjaer, speaking at a press conference on Thursday, also set himself the target of winning the Premier League title. The Norwegian admitted it has been too long since United’s last title win in 2013, while also cautioning his current squad against complacency. “To lift the Premier League trophy again is what we expect, what we’re used to. “We can’t wait too many years but we have to take it step by step. It can’t happen overnight. “Players who get complacent never last at this club. I’m the same. I can’t be complacent now I’ve got the job. That’s not me. We’re looking forward. “We’ve got to work harder. I think the players know my expectations for the future,” Solskjaer said.
