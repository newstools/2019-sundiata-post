By Aisha Ahmed Kano – The Kano State Government has warned industries operating in the state to ensure cleanliness in the communities where they operated. The Commissioner for Environment, Dr Ali Makoda, gave the warning on
Friday in Kano while monitoring the monthly environmental sanitation for
Motor parks, markets and work places. Makoda, represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry,
Alhaji Aliyu Garo, said many industries failed to consider the health of
the people living in the communities they operated from. “Today, we inspected some industries in Sharada, where we received public complaints on bad ordour from the company. “We earlier sent our staff to check the situation and they proffered
solution to the company and we are happy to state that the company has
complied,” he said. Garo also commended the three industries visited by the state
sanitation committee on Friday, for their “clean working environment.“ The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the committee has
visited Salsar Enterprises, Myer Bottled Water Company as well as B and B
