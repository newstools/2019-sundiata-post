By Isaac Ukpoju Lafia – Gov. Umaru Al-Makura of Nasarawa state has inaugurated a 31-member transition committee to ensure hitch free transfer of power to the state’s governor elect Mr Abdullahi Sule, on May 29. Al-Makura inaugurated the committee at the Government House in Lafia on Wednesday. He said the committee would guide the process of ensuring smooth and seamless transition in order to sustain the progress and development of the state. “The committee is intended to serve as vehicle for holistic evaluation of this administration’s stewardship and performance since 2011. “This course of action has become imperative in view of the need to review the activities of government in order to highlight areas that are critical for sustenance and improvement by the in-coming administration,” Al-Makura said. According to the governor, the committee is saddled with the responsibility of reviewing his administration’s stewardship in all sectors from May 29, 2011 to May 29, 2019. “It will also identify challenges in the implementation of policies, projects and programmes of the administration and suggest likely steps for the incoming administration to explore,” he said. He added that the committee would examine Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), as well as government-owned companies; including available manpower and make appropriate recommendations. He explained that part of the committee’s terms of reference would be to plan and execute a befitting handing over ceremony from the outgoing administration to the incoming one come May 29. The committee, he said, has four weeks to submit its reports. The committee is being co-chaired by the incumbent deputy governor Mr Silas Agara and incoming deputy governor Mr Emmanuel Akabe.
