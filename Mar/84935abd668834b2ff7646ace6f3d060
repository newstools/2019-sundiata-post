Every modern, successful nation must have five core elements: (1) economic justice so that even the weakest and the most vulnerable stratum of the society can live, not just survive (2) social justice so that accidents of birth, geography, and religious beliefs arenâ€™t permanent barriers to the prospects of upward social and economic mobility (3) a responsible and sincere government that serves the people and not the other way round (4) a critical and watchful media system that acts as the watchdog of the government and not the lapdog of the temporary occupants of power (5) an educated, vigilant, and engaged citizenry who are not susceptible to cheap elite manipulation and narrow primordial loyalties. A nation that has only the first two elements is a fragile nation. A nation with just one of these elements has no reason to exist. And a nation with not a single one of these five core elements is Nigeria. Source: Facebook
