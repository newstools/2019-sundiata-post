By Aderogba George Abuja – The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has moved to seize plots of land and duplexes worth N264 million from three civil servants working in the Federal Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs. Spokesperson for ICPC, Mrs Rasheedat Okoduwa, said in a statement on Wednesday, that the properties under investigations were owned by Poloma Nuhu, Mangset Dickson and Daniel Obah. The properties also include 19 plots of land, 10 hectares of farmland and two duplexes, spread around Abuja and three towns in Rivers. The statement noted that the 10 hectares of farmland located in Kuje, Abuja, were allegedly acquired through corrupt acts by Nuhu, a Principal Accountant with the ministry. The ICPC said that the properties were valued to be well above the legitimate earnings and incomes of the accused. The commission said that it relied on Section 48 (2) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act 2000, which gives it the power of seizure of assets obtained by individuals through corrupt means. It added that it would seize another 15 plots of land from Nuhu, which were all located in Gwagwalada, Abuja. It said that Nuhu would also temporarily lose ownership of 10 hectares of farm land valued at N50 million and an uncompleted duplex, valued at N90 million, at Apo Estate, Abuja. The commission said that Obah, a Principal Accountant in the Finance and Account Department of the Ministry, would also lose temporary ownership of a N60 million four-bedroom duplex located in Karsana, Abuja. It said that Obah would lose another three plots of land with a collective value of N64.5 million located in Abe Ndoni, Obio-Akpor in Port Harcourt, River. The third suspect, Dickson, will also lose ownership of a plot of land valued at N7 million, located at Kubwa, a suburb of Abuja.
