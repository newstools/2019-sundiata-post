In 2018, NNPC’s refineries lost N138b alone! That was the figure released. We don’t know how much was covered. ‘Thief’ Atiku said he would privatise this money-guzzling outdated and cesspit of corruption called NNPC, you said Atiku is a thief. He wanted to sell it to his friends. If there is one government agency successive regimes have always serially ABUSED, RAPED, DEVOURED and SCAVENGED, it is the NNPC. In fact, under this regime of “saints” and “poor people”, it is even worse. Go and do your findings and come back and tell me how Buhari, the “holy President”, financed his second term campaign. I don’t know why a nation is always afraid to face its demons and deal with them. Seven years ago, Goodluck Jonathan wanted to remove subsidy for good. Opposition groups financed by Tinubu and given moral push by Tunde Bakare kicked against the move. Today, we would have been buying fuel at maximum of N67 per litre. Going by crude oil prices. Jonathan never recovered from the de-marketing that followed the subsidy protests then. Now, even if Atiku is the biggest thief (a nomenclature many have pinned on the guy even when they can’t point to anything he stole), could dare to say he would sell the NNPC, he should be encouraged. Whereas, the man who tells us his second name is integrity has retained the agency with all its rot and mess. No any attempt to even reform the place and clean it up. To many despicable low minds, NNPC was a mess in 2014 under the “thieving one” called Jonathan and was not even operating at a loss. Today, under Mr. Clean, the place is a complete mess and operating at loss and even the man himself the petroleum minister. If hypocrisy does not kill us in Nigeria, nothing else will.
