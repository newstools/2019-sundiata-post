The State Secretary of the party, Mr Wafarniyi Theman, disclosed this on Tuesday at a press conference in Yola. Theman said the internal crisis that followed the party’s congresses
and primaries had been resolved, and that all stakeholders had resolved
to work for the party’s victory in the polls. “I want to assure you that to the glory of God, the party has been
able to contain its internal crisis and all hands are now on deck to
work for Gov.Muhammadu Bindow’s victory on Saturday,” Theman said. He lauded the contributions and support of various stakeholders in
resolving the party’s challenges, adding that victory was certain. The secretary said the Bindow-led APC government in the state had
performed well and that the electorate would certainly vote for
continuity. While congratulating President Muhammadu Buhari for his re-election,
Theman commended the mature and peaceful manner the people of the state
conducted themselves during the presidential and National Assembly
elections and urged them to replicate the gesture on Saturday. “We voted for continuity in the presidential election and will surely
repeat the same decision on Saturday for our governor and house of
assembly members,” Theman. (NAN) By Yakubu Uba Yola - Ahead of Saturday governorship election, Secretary to the Government of…  The All Progressives Congress (APC) National Working Committee (NWC) has suspended Governors Ibikunle Amosun of…
