By Shedrack Frank Yenagoa – A philanthropist, Mr Reuben Okoya, has urged Bayelsa youths to strive to develop themselves rather than depend on politicians for sustenance. Okoya gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Yenagoa shortly after a town hall meeting on ways to move Bayelsa youths forward. The town hall meeting held on Friday. He said  that some politicians would use the youth and dump them. Okoya added that politics was not a permanent job or a profession, but a part -time duty, and therefore should not  be regarded as an end. Okoya said that youths would do more when developed. “You should endeavour to go to school, study professional courses such as engineering, accountancy, pharmacy architecture, medicine, agriculture, or you can even go to into business. “I am an independent person; nobody can intimidate me or even push me around.  If politics does not favour me, I can easily go back to my business,” he said. According to Okoya, there is the need for the youth to think out of the box. “You must find relevant people in the government to communicate your ideas to. “Don’t see politics as a career; you can comfortably survive without it,” he said. Also speaking,Dr Ekiyor Weldon, the Executive Director, Coalition for Development and Democracy in Bayelsa, organisers of the event, said that the programme was to create a platform for Bayelsa youths to have interface with their leaders. Weldon said that such an interface would broaden their knowledge and enable them to take wise decisions. (NAN)
