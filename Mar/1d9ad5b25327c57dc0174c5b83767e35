Bucharest – European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans on Tuesday renewed calls on Romania to respect democracy and the Rule of Law after its government pushed through controversial reforms to the judiciary. Timmermans made the remarks in Bucharest at the National University
of Political Studies and Public Administration, which was awarding him a
honourary doctorate. “If the Rule of Law is put under threat, if the media are curtailed
in their free reporting, if democracy is reinterpreted as the winner
takes it all, then almost automatically corruption increases,’’
Timmermans said. In recent months, the European Commission has criticised Romania,
which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, for backsliding on
commitments to uphold judicial independence and tackle corruption. Timmermans was afterwards planning to discuss with Social Democratic
Prime Minister Viorica Dancila the fight against corruption, in which he
said there had been “no progress’’ in Romania. On Tuesday, he is set to hold informal talks with the EU ministers for European affairs. A decree, passed February by Dancila’s cabinet, changed the procedure of appointing magistrates. It also limits the power of the chief state prosecutor who has
opposed the justice reform that the government pushed through in spite
of criticism from the EU. The reforms have been criticised as they weaken the country’s
anti-corruption agency, the DNA, which has led a broad crackdown on
corrupt officials.
