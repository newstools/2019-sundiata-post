Manila – Three suspected communist rebels were killed on Thursday when police repelled a pre-dawn attack on a municipal police station in the eastern Philippines, police said. Senior Superintendent Delia Rentuya said about 50 communist
guerrillas attacked the police station in the town of Victoria in
Northern Samar province, 400 kilometres south-east of Manila, before
dawn. “Only 15 police officers were at the station during the attack, but
they were able to defend the station and put up a firefight with the
communist rebels occupying the rooftop or third floor of the station,”
she said. Rentuya said that two police officers were injured in the firefight. Communist rebels have been fighting the Philippine government since
the late 1960s, making the movement one of the longest-running leftist
insurgencies in Asia. President Rodrigo Duterte terminated peace talks with the communist rebels in November 2017. Efforts to resume the talks have failed amid escalating attacks by the guerrillas.
