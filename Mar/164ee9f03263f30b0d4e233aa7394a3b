By shuaib Sadiq Kaduna – Nafiu Baba-Ahmed, Secretary-General, Supreme Council for Sharia in Nigeria, has appealed to Kaduna State  residents to conduct themselves peacefully during Saturday’s Governorship and State Assembly Polls. Baba-Ahmed, who made the appeal while addressing a news conference in Kaduna on Friday, said residents must live in peace to allow for the democratic process to thrive in the state. He said both faith, Islam and Christianity, preached peace and peaceful co-existence among adherents and therefore, there was no need for panic during every election period that might result in security breach. “People of the state and the country at large must live together peacefully for faster development and they must report any person or group of persons engaged in any security breach for the law to take its course. “ Residents must report any one seen trying to cause threat to peace and security during and even after the polls to the relevant authorities in the state,“ he said. Baba-Ahmed, who is also a member of the Board of Trustees of the  Kaduna Peace Commission,  said the doors of the two organisations were open throughout the election period for any complaints.(NAN)
