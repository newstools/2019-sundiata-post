By Auwalu Yusuf Daura – The Daura Local Government in Katsina State has commenced a one week sensitisation on precautionary measures against outbreak of measles and meningitis. Alhaji Abba Mato, the Council Chairman, made this known in an
interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Daura on Friday. Mato said the council had engaged the services of stakeholders across
the 11 wards by conducting house-to-house and door-to-door
enlightenment campaign on preventive and curative measures against the
killer diseases. According to him, town criers have been dispatched to the various
towns and villages through the traditional leaders for effective and
wider coverage of the campaign, considering the recent change in weather
and humidity. He said the enlightenment committee comprised of health experts,
traditional rulers and counsellors, who were expected to give
professional talks on preventive measures against such diseases. Mato said that the council would equally sponsor radio jingles and
cinematic shows on similar subject matter with a view to achieving high
results. He noted that the council had intensified efforts on routine immunisation and counselling on hygiene and sanitation. Alhaji Ahmed Murtala, the Council Director of Heath, assured that the
campaign would cover schools, market places and other public forums for
effective delivery and wider coverage. He noted that the council had recorded tremendous success in the
fight against the seven child-killer diseases like polio, malnutrition
and other related ailments. Murtala said that they would not relent in their efforts to promote the health of the  people. “We caution people on the imperative of hygiene, routine immunisation and sleeping in spacious ventilated rooms, ‘’ he said. NAN reports that the wife of Mr President, Hajiya Aisha Buhari, in
2017, constructed a multi-million naira Child and Maternal Health Centre
in Daura to promote the health of women and children in the area.
