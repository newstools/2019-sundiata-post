The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation says it has commenced recruitment of fresh graduates and experienced professionals. The Group General Manager, Public Affair Division, NNPC, Ndu Ughamadu, was quoted by The Cable to have confirmed on Wednesday that the recruitment advert on its portal was genuine. He said, “The portal was opened today and I have received hundreds of inquiries whether it is correct or not,” he said in a statement. “We are going to recruit people from different engineering fields, especially fresh graduates and equally in the administrative areas.” Ughamadu explained that the recruitment would be in three categories – fresh graduates, senior officers/ supervisory cadre and managerial cadre. He gave the recruitment portal address as https:/careers.nnpcgroup.com. In November, the national oil company had denied ever maintaining a staff strength of 70,000 in its history. There have been previous incidents of widely circulated social media adverts about vacancies in the corporation which came out to be false.
