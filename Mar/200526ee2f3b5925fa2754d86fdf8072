By Abujah Racheal Abuja – The President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Rev. Samson Ayokunle, has urged stakeholders to ensure a violence-free and fair Governorship/House of Assembly polls on Saturday. Ayokunle made the plea  in a statement through his Special Assistant, Media and Communications, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, on Friday in Abuja. The cleric reminded electorate of the need to avoid violence, bloodshed and all forms of electoral offences. “Tomorrow is the state governorship and state assembly polls nationwide, with the exception of few states where the governorship poll has been held. “All eligible voters with their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) should come out en-masse to exercise their inalienable rights without any fear of being intimidated and vote according to their conscience. “Not to vote is to allow the wrong candidates to occupy the position of leadership they do not deserve,” he advised. The CAN President urged stakeholders, politicians, security agencies and the officials of the INEC to ensure a peaceful atmosphere before, during and after the elections. “Our politicians should avoid rigging, violence, vote buying, ballot snatching and other electoral offences; our security operatives, especially the Police and the Army, must operate within the ambit of the law, while our youths should resist the temptation of being used to foment troubles,” he stressed. He, however, urged INEC officials and security operatives involved in the conduct of the polls to remain impartial and apolitical. He advised INEC to conduct its activities better than in previous elections and ensure that the collation of results was free, fair, transparent and accessible to all stakeholders. “It is high time we tell  the whole world that our democracy has come of age,” he said.(NAN)
