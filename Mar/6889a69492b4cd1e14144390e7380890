Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, have accused Igini of colluding with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to rig the election. But in an interview with The Nation, Igini said his accusers wanted him to compromise the elections. “The very people who wanted me to compromise are the ones who are accusing me. They are the ones who wanted me to travel abroad to hold a secret meeting with them and I said no. “I said why do you want to go abroad and discuss the affairs of an electoral process outside Nigeria? Why do you want me to enter aeroplane and go to where? If you want to have a meeting with me, come to my office. “Since I have been in this state, anybody who says he has given me pure water, let him or her come forward and say so. All those who contested the elections whether in PDP or APC or any party, I don’t know them other than their lists of the names. “As I speak to you, I don’t have their contacts, even those who won. If I see them on the way, I won’t recognise them,” he said. Igini also said the era of “writing fictitious results are over”. According to him, apart from 1999, no genuine elections had been conducted in the state until the last one under his watch. “In Akwa Ibom, apart from 1999, they have not been delivering ballot papers results sheets to polling units. “They have been writing results in Akwa Ibom state. There were no genuine elections in the state and I said there has to be a paradigm shift to the side of the will of the people,” Igini added
