By Ige Adekunle Sango-Ota – Members of Batch A18 that served in Sango Ota, Ogun have been urged to explore the opportunity of securing employment in various companies in the area. Mr Adekunle Oguntoyinbo, the Unit Commander, Federal Road Safety
Corps (FRSC) in Sango-Ota, Ogun, gave the advice on Thursday, during the
send-Off party organised by Sango-Ota FRSC Command for the batch that
served in the unit.He said such step was necessary for them, rather than
be in a haste to return home after their national service. “We thank God on behalf of some of the Corp members that were 
retained in their places of primary assignment and those that got
employed by some of the companies in Sango-Ota, “he said. The unit commander, however, wished the ex-Corps members good luck in
their future endeavours and urged them to be good ambassadors of FRSC
where ever they found themselves. He also urged those given extension of service , among the corps
members, for various reasons, to be more dedicated and committed in
their places of primary assignment. According to him, if they change and perform to the satisfaction in
primary assignment, some of them can equally be retained by their
employers. Blessing Damilola, the Cadet-in Chief, thanked the unit commander for the father roles he played during their service year. Damilola, who spoke on behalf of other Corp members, promised that
they would be good ambassadors of FRSC, where ever they might be to
accomplish their future endeavours.
