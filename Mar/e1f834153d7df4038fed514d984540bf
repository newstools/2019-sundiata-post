After the 2019 elections, JAMB candidates are expected to write the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME. However, the date for the computer based testing   examination is uncertain as the previous date has been shifted from Saturday, 16th March and on Saturday,   23rd March, 2019 to unspecified date after the elections. In place of the previous date scheduled for the CBT examination, the authorities of Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has rescheduled its mock examination for Saturday, 23rd March 2019. Its spokesperson, Dr. Fabian Benjamin had explained that the purpose of the mock examination was to enable candidates familiarize   themselves with the use of CBT, adding, “It would not be used for any assessment process.” He clarification the insinuations from some quarters that marks from the mock examination would be added to scores obtained in the main examination. “Mock examination was introduced in 2017 to give candidates the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the conduct of Computer Based Test, particularly, candidates who are not conversant with the use of computers,” he  explained. Besides, there are other preparations candidates have to put in place before the examination. Candidates are to begin the printing of their mock examination slips from Wednesday 6th, March. I hope you are aware that the examination board had released the novel to be read by all candidates who will participate in the 2019 UTME. Candidates are to note that irrespective of their choice of course of study, they will   be tested on a general text on  “Sweet Sixteen” authored by Bolaji Abdullahi  for UTME, while the book titled:  “The Last Days at Forcados High School” by H. Mohammed is for Direct Entry Candidates.
