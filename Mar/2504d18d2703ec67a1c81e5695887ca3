London – England captain Harry Kane said he would support any of his team mates in walking off the pitch if there was any repeat of Monday’s racist abuse during their win in Montenegro. UEFA have opened an investigation after England players Danny Rose, Raheem Sterling and Callum Hudson-Odoi said they were victims of the abuse in Podgorica. Teenager Hudson-Odoi said he had heard monkey chants during England’s 5-1 Euro 2020 qualifying victory. The Football Association welcomed UEFA’s move after what it described as “abhorrent’’ racist abuse. “It’s terrible, its unacceptable, and I thought our players handled it so well and were so professional and focussed on their job and doing what they do best,” Kane said outside Buckingham Palace where he was receiving an MBE for services to football. “Now it’s up to the people in charge to make sure the right action is taken because it’s not acceptable in football or any part of life.” Asked if England’s players would walk off the pitch if there was a repeat, Kane said: “Yeah.’’ “Well, I’m supportive of my team mates and if it happened again and they weren’t happy and wanted to talk about it or take a breather I will fully back them,” the Tottenham Hotspur striker said. “We are a team, a unit and we stick behind all of our players. Hopefully, it will never happen again. But if it did, I will take their lead on that and whatever they wanted we will support them in that.” UEFA’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary panel will hear the case against Montenegro on May 16.(Reuters/NAN)
