By Babatunde Ogunrinde Lagos – Nigeria Customs started their 2019 Africa women’s volleyball club championship campaign on a good note by beating Burkina Faso’s USFA 3-0 in the opening match on Saturday in Cairo, Egypt. The combination of team captain Priscilla Agera, Tochi Nnoruga, Ladi Jalmet and Aisha Umar were too strong for the USFA side girls, and they duly won 25-3 in the first set. The Customs girls let their guards down a little in the second set, winning 25-9 though. USFA reduced the large margins by losing 17-25 in the third set. Reacting to the victory, the Secretary-General of Nigeria Customs Service’ Sports Unit, Samuel Onikeku, said their team were playing at a different level. He noted that the team were more coordinated and displayed better court discipline. “This is a good start for the Nigeria Customs female volleyball team. The first set was a record and we played better as we proceeded. “The girls are playing at a different level now, because they are well motivated and it has translated to more coordination and court discipline. “Before we left for Cairo, we played numerous friendly matches while in camp and this helped us a lot,’’ Onikeku said. He expressed optimism that the team would play better in their next match, because they have two free days to improve on their defence and court discipline. Nigeria Customs will, in their next match, face Canon of DR Congo on Tuesday by 3 p.m. (NAN)
