Abuja(SundiataPost) -The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has revealed that the total number of candidates that registered for the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) increased largely due to the fee slashed by the Federal Government from N5,000 to N3,500. The board also disclosed that it had received no fewer than 93,748 applications from candidates seeking admission into universities in the country through the 2019 Direct Entry (DE) admission. This was contained in the JAMB’s Weekly Bulletin made available to newsmen in Abuja on Sunday by the board’s Head of Media, Dr Fabian Benjamin. A total of 1,881,488 candidates registered to sit for the 2019 UTME, with the hope of getting admission into various tertiary education institutions in the country, while the number of registered candidates in 2018 was 1.6 million. JAMB noted that most of the candidates interviewed confirmed that the reduction of the registration by the Federal Government encouraged them to register for the examination. The board, which stated that Direct Entry application is for admission into second year for first degree programme in university, said only candidates with relevant qualification would be considered for admission.
