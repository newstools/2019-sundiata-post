By Salisu Sani-Idris Abuja – Independent Hajj Reporters (IHR), a civil society organisation that monitors and reports about hajj activities in Nigeria, on Wednesday alerted the public over a fake 2019 hajj fare package in circulated on Social Media. The National Coordinator of the organisation, Alhaji Ibrahim Mohammed, in a statement said that the Social media surveillance team of the CSO had brought to its notice a fake 2019 hajj fare package currently in circulation. “As journalists and an organisation that has been reporting hajj and umrah activities, we therefore, call on members of the public to be wary of fake news and instead visit the website of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), or Hajj reporters social media handles for any announcement on the 2019 hajj fare. “This year’s hajj fare has not been announced and we are yet to understand where the authors of N1.8 million hajj fare got their news from,” Ibrahim said. He quoted a verse in the Holy Quran which frowns against spreading fake news and its consequences. “O you who believe! If a Faasiq (liar-evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done.” Mohammed recalled that in 2017, an anonymous post went viral on Social Media bordering on the hajj fares announced by NAHCON with the authors insinuating foul-play. “The commission explained and put the matter to rest. However, the same post resurfaced in 2018 and again, clarifications were made by the commission. “To reinforce the fact that this is a case of fake news, it should be noted that the 2019 hajj packages are yet to be announced and 2018 hajj fare is less than N1.5 million, ” he said.
