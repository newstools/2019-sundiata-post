CAPE TOWN – South Africa’s rising debt trajectory will make it difficult to weather a significant global economic downturn, the central bank deputy governor said, adding it would take at least a decade to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio down to the 30 to 40 percent range. Deputy governor Kuben Naidoo also said on Wednesday that growth in Africa’s most industrialised economy was seen hovering around the 2 percent over the next few years. (Reuters)
