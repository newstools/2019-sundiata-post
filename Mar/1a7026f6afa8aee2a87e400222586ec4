By Tukur Muntari Kano – The Coalition of INEC Accredited Observers for Kano State re-run governorship supplementary election have hailed INEC for distribution of the election materials on time. The leader of the group, Amb. Chinyere Manukwem, made the commendation while addressing newsmen in Kano on Sunday. Manukwem represented the Global Initiative for Civic Training and
Youth Development, one of the 18 Observer Groups accredited by INEC. She said the commendation was necessary because the distribution of
both sensitive and non-sensitive materials was done in good time. “The distribution of the electoral materials both sensitive and non-sensitive was done in a record time,” she said. He said following the distribution of materials early enough, the
election began early enough at most of the polling units visited by the
group. According to the group, the election has also witnessed massive
turnout of voters, especially women as well as heavy presence of
security personnel at all the polling units visited. “Most of the political party agents that participated in the election were present at the polling units. “In most of the polling units visited, the election was relatively
peaceful with the exception of Dala and Gama wards in Nasarawa local
government areas where the election was disrupted by hoodlums,” Manukwem
said. The election observers, however, commended the security agents for
their quick intervention by restoring law and order in the affected
areas. Manukwem, who commended the electorate for coming out en masse to
exercise their franchise, lauded the media for adequate coverage of the
supplementary election. The group, however, called on critical stakeholders to continue to
educate electorate on the need for peaceful conduct during elections. It slso urged politicians to always accept election results as it is not a do or die affair.
