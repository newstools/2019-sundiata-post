By Constance Imasuen Abuja – The Nigerian Security Printing and Minting PlC on Thursday called for collaboration with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in the printing of sensitive documents. The NCC Director of Public Affairs, Mr Nnamadi Nwokike made the call in a statement in Abuja. Nwokike quoted Alhaji Abas Masanawa, Managing Director, Nigerian Security Printing and Minting (NSPM), as making the call when he visited the commission’s office in Abuja. The NSPM boss was at the headquarters of the commission to seek for partnership, especially in the areas of printing sensitive documents. Masanawa, who was accompanied by top management staff of the company, however, said that like NCC, the company is aiming to become a world class organisation, which can attract business from outside the shores of the country. Responding, the Executive Vice Chairman, NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta lauded the performance of the regulatory body. He said the commission, aimed at beating the record platinum rating it received from a sister agency, Bureau of Public Service Reform (BPSR) two years ago. According to the NCC boss, the commission is now globally acclaimed for regulatory excellence and operational efficiency. He said this had helped NCC to achieve great success in the key areas of its mandate. “The verdict is out there on the performance of the commission as a word class regulatory agency. “We didn’t pass this verdict by ourselves. “But it took a lot of hard work and commitment by both management and the entire staff of the commission to achieve the enviable position we are today,” he said. Danbatta said despite inheriting a world class organisation, he has not left any stone unturned in his efforts to add to the success story.(NAN)
