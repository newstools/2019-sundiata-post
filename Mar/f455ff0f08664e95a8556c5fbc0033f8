Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The People’s Democratic Party (PDP)
condemns Saturday’s violent attacks and killing of PDP agents and members by
thugs unleashed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Kano
Supplementary election. The PDP also  alerted
that APC thugs, aided by compromised security agents, have been on rampage,
invading polling units where they are attacking PDP members and supporters with
dangerous weapons, chasing them away from the polling units and preventing them
from voting. In Gama ward, evidence abounds of how APC thugs attacked and
unleashed terror on PDP members during which four of our members where feared
killed and many more injured. APC thugs violated the secrecy of the ballot
process, beat up and chased away supporters of the PDP after which they engaged
in massive ballot stuffing for the APC. The National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan who
dropped the hint in a statement, informed that aliens imported by the APC
attempted to participate in the election and attacked journalists and observers
who attempted to raise issues on the infraction. “In the face of this unrelenting aggression by the APC, the
PDP directs its formation in the state to immediately activate our legitimate
defence mechanism to protect our members and supporters in Kano state, he said. The party called on the Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC), the international community and all lovers of democracy in
Nigeria to rise in condemnation of the APC’s resort to violence in Kano, knowing
the volatile nature of the state. The PDP added that it has taken stock of all the aggressions
in Kano and will use all legitinate means to ensure that all those who
perpetuated violence against our members are lawfully tracked down and brought
to book.
