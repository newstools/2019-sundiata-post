By Chimezie Anaso Awka – The Ananmbra Head of Service (HoS), Mr Harry Uduh, has lauded civil servants in the state for voting massively for candidates of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) during the March 9 House of Assembly election. Uduh, who gave the commendation in an interview with the News Agency
of Nigeria (NAN) in Awka on Wednesday, described the victory of APGA
candidates as a re-endorsement of the administration of Gov. Willie
Obiano by workers and the entire Anambra populace. He said that Anambra people voted for continued harmonious
relationship between the executive and legislative arms of government
which was a major condition for the state to remain on a sustainable
development path. He applauded the civil servants for their productivity and promised that their welfare would remain paramount. According to Uduh, that was an election that affected us, the masses
directly; they came out en mass to vote for peace, harmony and
continuity. “I want to thank Anambra workers for their support for the governor
on March 9 by voting for the candidates of APGA in the House of Assembly
election. “They have shown that they appreciate the worker-friendly policies
and actions of the governor, and they have shown that they want it to
continue. “The governor has been regular in the payment of workers’ salaries
and allowances, retirees’ gratuity and pensions, and he has equally
promised to be the first to implement the new minimum wage whenever it
is signed. “A healthy and harmonious relationship between the governor and the
House of Assembly is important to achieving good programmes of the
governor for the state, so by their voting behaviour, they have shown
that they are with His Excellency,” he said. NAN reports that APGA won 24 of the 30 seats in the Anambra House of
Assembly, while the opposition Peoples Democratic Party won six.
