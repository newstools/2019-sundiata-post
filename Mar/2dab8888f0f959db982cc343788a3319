Olawale Jokotoye Abeokuta – The Sikirulai Ogundele-led faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun on Thursday endorsed the governorship candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) for the Saturday’s governorship polls in the state. Ogundele announced the endorsement at a news conference in Abeokuta. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governorship
candidate of the PDP faction, Hon. Ladi Adebutu, on Wednesday failed in
his legal bid to nullify the nomination of Sen. Buruji Kashamu, who is
the INEC recognised PDP candidate for the governorship polls. Justice Abubakar Shittu of the Federal High Court, Abeokuta, ruling
in the case filled by Adebutu, on Wednesday held that the election
primaries which produced Adebutu as the governorship candidate of the
DDP was conducted in violation of the law. The court therefore confirmed Kashamu as the authentic candidate of the PDP in Ogun. Ogundele explained that his group had endorsed and declared support for the APM governorship candidate, Mr Kunle Akinlade. He said that Nigerian constitution guaranteed freedom of association
and had therefore directed its members across the state to come out en
-masse on Saturday and vote for Akinlade. “Ogun is an important state in Nigeria and our decision has been
informed by the need to sustain the state in the area of development
which the current administration has initiated. “Politics is about credibility, responsiveness and integrity, among others and we have found all these qualities in Akinlade. “We believe that this development will enhance his chances of winning the governorship polls in the state,” he said (NAN)
