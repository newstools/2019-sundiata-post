London – Top-class goals from Bernardo Silva and Sergio Aguero took Manchester City back to the top of the Premier League in a 2-0 win over Fulham at Craven Cottage on Saturday. City’s seventh successive league victory keeps alive their hopes an unprecedented quadruple of League Cup, Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League trophies this season. A wayward ball from Fulham’s Timothy Fosu-Mensah gifted the visitors the lead in the fifth minute. Sergio Aguero intercepted the Dutchman’s pass just outside the area and passed to Silva, who cut across past two defenders and drove his left-footed shot into the corner past the diving Sergio Rico in goal.Fulham, playing without top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic after the international break, kept five men in the back line in a bid to keep City’s attack at bay.The formation led to one-way traffic and in the end, the Cottagers were unable to register a single shot on target all game. Silva turned provider in the 27th minute, pouncing onto a loose ball and passing to Aguero, who sprang forward past three defenders and shot from a tight angle up into the opposite corner. It was Aguero’s league-leading 19th goal of the season. The win takes City back to the top of the Premier League on 77 points, one ahead of Liverpool who host Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Fulham remain in 19th place on 17 points, and will now most likely need to win every one of their remaining six matches to have a chance of avoiding relegation. (Reuters/NAN)
