Frankfurt – A gathering of 600 young people turned violent over the weekend in the centre of Frankfurt as rocks were thrown at police and no fewer than one person was arrested, local media reported on Sunday. Police said the flash mob gathering on Saturday in Frankfurt’s main
shopping street, the Zeil, was the result of rivalry between two YouTube
stars and their fans. A spokeswoman could not confirm if it was related to a mass brawl
between 400 people in a central square in Berlin on Thursday that was
the result of a call to action by two YouTube rivals. Frankfurt police said they intervened because the group was displaying no regard for passers-by. They ordered the 21-year-old organiser to leave the scene. A policeman was then punched in the face, allegedly by a 17-year-old, who was arrested and injured in the process. Others responded by throwing stones, striking three officials, although the flash mob dispersed two hours later. “The fracas was not related to a march against racism that was taking place in Frankfurt on the same day,’’ police said. On Thursday, about 400 young people responded to a call by supporters
of two YouTube rivals to gather at Alexanderplatz, a large square in
central Berlin, erupting into a fight involving around 50 people. The fracas originated in a conflict between Stuttgart rapper
Thatsbekir, who has about 260,000 followers, and Bahar Al Amood from
Berlin, with 13,000 followers.
