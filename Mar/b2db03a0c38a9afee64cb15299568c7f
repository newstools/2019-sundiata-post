Geneva – The United Nations Human Rights Council on Friday condemned Israel’s “apparent intentional use of unlawful lethal and other excessive force” against civilian protesters in Gaza. UN called for perpetrators of all violations in the strip to face justice. The Geneva forum adopted a resolution on accountability, brought by Pakistan on behalf of the Organisation of
the Islamic Conference (OIC), by a vote of 23 states in favour, 8 against with 15 abstentions. European countries were divided. The United States does not participate, having quit the body in 2018 over perceived anti-Israel bias. The text was based on a report by a UN inquiry which said that Israeli security forces may have committed war
crimes and crimes against humanity. Especially in killing 189 Palestinians and wounding over 6,100 at weekly protests in 2018.
