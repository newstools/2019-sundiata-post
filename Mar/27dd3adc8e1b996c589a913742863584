President Muhammadu Buhari has missed the colloquium of national leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, to mark his 67th birthday. The event is currently ongoing at the International Conference Center (ICC), Abuja with the theme “Next Level: Work For People”. The colloquium is held annually to mark Tinubu’s birthday. Buhari had attended the last two colloquiums held in honour of the former Lagos State Governor. Reason why the president is absent is unknown; however, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has arrived at the venue and is expected to chair the event. There would be discussions among panelists on jobs and the economy. Organisers say the programme would be used to showcase government’s efforts to add millions of jobs over the next four years. Lagos State Governor, Akinwumi Ambode, delivered the opening address which he used to thank all present to celebrate Tinubu. Among the dignitaries at the event is former Osun State Governor, Rauf Aregbesola; minister of labour, Chris Ngige, Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje among others. Source: Qed
