people since 2017 up till date; I have duped about five people. “I collected different amount of money from my victims and all of them used to transfer money to my bank accounts. “I used to tell them that I will help them to secure employment with the Nigerian Custom Services, but I was just scamming.” Some of the items recovered from him include, Nigerian Customs
Service Application Forms, employment letters, passport photographs of
some job seekers among others. “He will soon be charged to court,” the statement said.
