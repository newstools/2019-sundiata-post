The Federal High Court sitting in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, has ordered the re-arrest of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. A report by Channels Television said that Justice Binta Nyako gave the order in a ruling on Thursday after revoking the bail granted to the IPOB leader. “She explained that the court gave the order because Mr Kanu had failed to appear in court after his bail was granted in April 2017,” the report said. According to News Express, Mazi Kanu has since returned to his base in the United Kingdom after initial stay in Israel following his escape from Nigeria during a brutal military crackdown during which his family ho Afaraukwu, Umuahia, Abia State, was riddled with bullets and several IPOB members reportedly killed in cold blood.
