By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) –
Centre for Democracy and Development  (CDD) has decried the destruction of  INEC 
RACs and materials in Benue and Ebonyi states few hours to the
commencement of governorship and House of Assembly elections in 29 states of
the country. The group made the
condemnation in a statement signed by Idayat Hassan made available to newsmen. The statement
reads in full: As Nigerians go to polls today to elect
governors and their representatives at their respective house of assemblies,
our observers have reported started reporting incidents that are capable of
disrupting voting. In Benue state, armed hoodlums razed down a RCM
primary school Aya containing electoral materials meant for Mbalom ward in Gwer
East Local Government Area of Benue state. However, no election official was
hurt. And in Ebonyi state, thugs burned down three
RACs, destroying election materials. Around 75 polling units and voting points
were affected. In addition, some 36,392 registered voters out of a total number
of 1,459,933 registered in the state were affected. We are calling on all the relevant
security stakeholders to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to stave off
further incidents of violence that might likely disrupt voting today and
consequently affect the outcome of the elections. Signed:

Idayat Hassan
