Rome – The Maltese navy on Thursday said it had taken control of a merchant ship that had been hijacked by its rescued migrant passengers, and was escorting it to the Maltese shore. “A special operation unit “was dispatched to board and secure the
vessel in order to hand over control of the ship back to the captain. “The tanker, her crew and all migrants are being escorted by the AFM
to Boiler Wharf to be handed over to the Police for further
investigations,’’ the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) said in a statement. The Armed Forces of Malta had said in a Wednesday statement that the
El Hiblu 1 tanker was taken over by 108 migrants when it was six miles
off the Libyan coast. “In radio communications, the captain repeatedly stated that he was not in control of the vessel. “He and his crew were being forced and threatened by a number of migrants to proceed to Malta,’’ the Maltese navy said. Migrants intercepted at sea are usually unhappy about being returned
to Libya, because in that country they are exposed to serious abuse,
including torture, rape and slave labour. Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, commenting on news of the
hijacking on Wednesday, called the migrants “pirates” and vowed to never
let them set foot in Italy.
