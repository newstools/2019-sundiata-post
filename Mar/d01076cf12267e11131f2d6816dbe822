Berlin – Former table tennis chief Adham Sharara has been banned for four years for “breaching his fiduciary duties’’ in his long reign as president of the governing ITTF, the organisation said Friday. The 65-year-old Canadian was accused of inappropriate use of ITTF funds, interfering in the bidding process of a contract and a conflict of interest over marketing rights. The ITTF said its executive committee reached the decision to ban Sharara with “a heavy heart’’ after reviewing the evidence. The organisation said Sharara, who led the ITTF from 1999 to 2014 and was still honorary president, declined “various invitations,’’ to attend hearings or put forward a defence.(dpa/NAN)
