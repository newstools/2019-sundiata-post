Washington – American Airlines on Sunday said it will extend flight cancellation through April 24 because of the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX after two fatal crashes since October and cut some additional flights. American, the largest U.S. carrier, said it is cancelling about 90 flights a day. American is the second-largest U.S. operator of the MAX in the U.S. with 24 jets, behind Southwest Airlines with 34. American said earlier this month it was flying about 85 flights a day
out of its 6,700 daily departures on 737 MAX planes when the grounded
was announced. The airline said it was making the announcement “to provide more
certainty to our customers and team members and better protect our
customers on other flights to their final destination.” Boeing Co is expected as early as Monday to formally disclose a
planned upgrade to its anti-stall system to the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) that has been in the works since October’s Lion Air
crash but still needs approval from U.S. regulators. The FAA has said it plans to mandate the upgrade by April, however,
it is still not clear if the upgrade will address any issues after the
March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash. On Saturday, Reuters reported American, Southwest and United Airlines
were all meeting with Boeing this weekend to review the software
upgrade. The FAA said earlier the “design changes” would result in flight
control system enhancements that will provide “reduced reliance on
procedures associated with required pilot memory items.” On Thursday, Reuters reported the upgrade would include a previously optional warning light. Many airlines, including American, already had the optional light.
