Nollywood actress, Oge Okoye, has defended her visit to Alleluia
Ministries International of South African pastor, Alph Lukau, who faked
the resurrection of a man in February 2019. The 38-year-old actress posted a lengthy message via
Instagram on Friday to explain her visit. She said that she didn’t usually address false news reports
but she was going to address this one, she wrote: “I Travelled to see my mum as
usual and she told me how she came across the youtube channel of AMI church and
that she’s been following them ever since because of what God is doing in the
church through Pastor Alphalukau. “So my mum wanted to visit the church because of her younger
sister(My aunt)who is a cancer patient,wheelchair bound and is bedridden. Due
to Mum’s age,I didn’t want her making that long journey from Spain to South
Africa so I requested for my aunt’s pictures and promised her that I would
visit the church so I can stand in for her as a point of contact.” She clarified that she visited Alleluia Ministries
International in October 2018 prior to the February incident where pastor Alph
Lukau faked the resurrection of a man adding that it was not wrong for her to
stand in gap for her sick aunty. Pastor Alph Lukau had stirred up controversy in February
when a video of him placing his hands on a supposed dead man in a coffin went
viral on social media. After the pastor screams “rise up”, the supposed dead
man rises to cheers from worshippers.  (Qed)
