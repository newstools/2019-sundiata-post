The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a number of police patrol vans and personnel have been stationed at the entrance of the party secretariat located along Ota-Efun road in Osogbo, but there has been no harassment of anyone there. The Police Public Relation Officer in the State, DSP Folashade Odoro, explained that  the policemen were deployed to the party’s secretariat for preventive measures only, following intelligence report of plans by some thugs to attack the place. She said that the deployment was to forestall breakdown of law and order. Also speaking, Mr Soji Adagunodo, the PDP Chairman in the State said a police officer had called to inform him of the deployment, even though the leadership of the party did not request for such. Adagunodo noted that the policemen did not harass any of the staff at the secretariat, but said the state PDP leadership was surprised over the police action. “We received a call from the Deputy Commissioner of Police that we are protesting, to the contrary, we are not protesting but only jubilating because of the victory of Sen. Ademola Adeleke at the tribunal. “We are law a abiding party and we will continue to jubilate till the time of judgment from the Appeal court. “The grand jubilation will come when Supreme Court gives final judgment; we are not disturbed or afraid of the presence of the police here. “We are a peace loving party and we will continue to be law abiding”, Adagunodo said.
