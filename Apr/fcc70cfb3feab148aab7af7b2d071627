Is Facebook still coded in PHP? It started as a pure PHP codebase. Then Facebook became “viral” and old PHP could not cope with millions of concurrent requests per second. The company worked in two directions: 1) Create it’s own high performance version of PHP running on a proprietary, optimized virtual machine. The Facebook PHP flavour has been called “Hack” and the virtual machine HHVM. 2) They expanded the infrastructure, so it now resembles other, massive scale architectures. That is, it has a lot of separate servers, languages and technologies working together to deliver instant messaging, video processing and so on. When you go to Facebook today, you are facing a Javascript based interface, possibly running on a Node.js server, which in turn talks with queuing systems, rendering systems etc, written in … everything: PHP, Java, C++ and even Erlang. The new generation PHP 7 actually includes a lot of the ideas for improvements that Facebook introduced in their own version. Nowadays, developing a proprietary version of PHP would be almost redundant: PHP 7+ took most of the good ideas and made them its own. Source: Quora.
