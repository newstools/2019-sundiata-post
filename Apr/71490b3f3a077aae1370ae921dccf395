Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata
Post) – Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) popularly known as Shi’ites
protested on Wednesday in commemoration of the 68th birthday of its
spiritual leader, Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky. Recall
that Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky has been in detention since 2015. During
the protest, Shi’ites members forced their way into the assembly complex and
chased away armed policemen on duty. Members
of the movement were initially peaceful in their conduct although they were
chanting anti-government songs from outside the gate. But situation turned awry
when some of them suddenly descended on the gate, shaking it vigorously until
they succeeded in forcing it open, almost causing a stampede because of the
crowd.
