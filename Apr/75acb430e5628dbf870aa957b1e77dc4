Washington – U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened Car tariffs if Mexico doesn’t stop immigration and drug flow across border in one year. Trump made the threat on Thursday at the White House, saying that if the tariffs do not yield the desired result, he will close the border. “If the drugs don’t stop we are going to tariff the cars,’’ Trump said. “If that doesn’t work we will close the border.’’ Trump insisted: “You know I will do it, I don’t play games.’’ He further said that a lot of good things are happening with Mexico. “Mexico understands that we will close the border or I’m going to tariffs the cars. “One or the other, probably start off with the tariffs. “That will be a powerful incentive, because Mexico has the strongest immigration laws anywhere in the world. “They don’t have courts like we do. We have a stupid system of courts. It’s the craziest thing in the world. We could be the only country that has it’’. (dpa/NAN)
