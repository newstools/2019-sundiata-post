Delivering judgment, Chief Usman Ibrahim, the President of the court,
held that the court had no other option than to dissolve the union
because of Valentine’s unwillingness to defend his marriage. ”Since the marriage has been damaged due to constant assault, the
seven-year-old union between Joy and Valentine ceases to be, in the
interest of peaceful living. “Joy shall  be issued a divorce certificate by the court   and she is free to go and remarry,” he said. He further said that since under Igbo custom, a woman is instructed
to return the bride price if she wants a divorce, Joy is to return N10,
000 paid for her bride price to the respondent. Earlier in her petition, Joy, a civil servant and a resident of 9,
