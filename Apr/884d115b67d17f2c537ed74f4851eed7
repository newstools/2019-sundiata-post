By Ngozi Njoku Lagos – A 34-year-old man, Olufunmilayo Fuwa, on Wednesday appeared before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly obtaining N800,000 under false pretence. Fuwa, of Iyare Street, Paiko, in Idimu area of Lagos, is facing a
three-count charge of obtaining money under false pretence, stealing and
forgery — offences which he denied. The prosecutor, Insp. Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that the
defendant committed the offences on April 8, 2017, at Kujore Street,
Ojota, in Lagos. Ihiehie alleged that the defendant collected N800,000 from the
complainant — Micheal Awosika — for an insurance policy after he
introduced himself as a staff of an insurance company located in Ikeja. “The complainant stated that Fuwa introduced him to an insurance
policy which required him to insure the sum of N800, 000, of which the
money was transferred to an FCMB account of the defendant with no:
0192044018. “Two years later after the policy had lapsed based on the document he
was given, the complainant called Fuwa severally, all to no avail. “Awosika decided to go to the head office of the said insurance
company, only for them to declare that he didn’t have any insurance
policy with them, and all efforts to trace him proved proved abortive,”
the prosecutor said. Ihiehie also alleged that Fuwa forged the seal and signature of the
Director of the said insurance company of which he gave certain
insurance policy document to the
complainant. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 314, 287
and 365(2) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 as amended. The Magistrate, Mrs H. B Mogaji, granted the defendant bail in the
sum of N200, 000 with two sureties in like sum, who must be gainfully
employed. She said their office and home addresses must be verified,  and adjourned the case until April 29 for mention.
