By Ige Adekunle Sango-Ota – The Ogun Command of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC)  on Wednesday said motorists driving  against traffic would be subjected to psychiatric test. Mr Clement Oladele, the Sector Commander of  the FRSC in Ogun, made
this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota. According to him, any driver caught driving against traffic during
the forthcoming Easter would also be prosecuted for dangerous driving. The sector commander further said that such erring drivers were liable to pay N50,000 as fine or risk imprisonment. “FRSC is hereby warning motorists against  such nefarious acts  in order  to check loss of lives and property, ” he said. Oladele also said the FRSC had embarked on a special patrol for the
Easter to reduce the discomfort of motorists travelling during the
festival. He said that the command had  reached an agreement with the
construction company, Julius Berger Plc, to open the barricaded section
of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway  in order to ease vehicular movement. Oladele further said that FRSC personnel would keep vigil  at
strategic locations to check the excesses of motorists during the
Easter. He implored motorists to maintain  their vehicles and plan well ahead of their trips while refraining from night journeys.
