The Senate has asked the Federal Government to secure the release of the last Dapchi school girl, Leah Sharibu, from the captivity of the Boko Haram. The appeal follows a Point of Order by Senator Shehu Sani during plenary on Thursday. He drew the attention of the Federal government to the continuous captivity of Leah Sharibu, thereby asking for prompt legislative intervention to bring her back home. Senator Sani is also asked for the release of the remaining Chibok girls still in Boko Haram captivity. Leah Sharibu was abducted along with 111 other school girls on February 19, 2018, from her school, Government Girls Science and Technical Secondary School in Dapchi, Yobe State. The Federal Government negotiated the release of the other girls but was unable to secure the release of Leah Sharibu who was unwilling to denounce her Christian faith to regain her freedom.
