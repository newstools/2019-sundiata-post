The aim is getting better after participation in any international competition,” he said. Bankole who is also a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) said that the just concluded competition is part of Nigeria’s team preparations for the African Games and the Olympics. “The tournament is part of our preparation for the two top competitions still coming up later.
