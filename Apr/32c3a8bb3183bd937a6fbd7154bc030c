Most machine learning supervised. Most supervised machine learning requires a heavy data cleansing component. Here’s the machine learning pipeline. Many that have the first two often lack the math and stats needed for number three. Many that have the math and stats in the third step lack the skills for the first two.

Start . You’ll never secure a top paying real world job without being able to cleanse your own data. Source: Quora
