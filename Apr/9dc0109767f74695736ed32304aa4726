Here is an overview comparing Botswana with South Africa. They are two completely different countries despite being neighbours. Development can mean many things but here I enumerate them with an inexhaustive list of just a few favourite indicators: BW = BotswanaZA = South Africa So the verdict? If one is looking for a quiet country with peace and security along with very low corruption and a fast developing economy then the more “developed country” would be Botswana. If you prefer a fast-moving metropolis with a complex structure and more urban, then South Africa would be the more “developed country”. South Africa can also offer a less urban “country life” & is more diverse but the downside would be the lack of security and some fairly unstable turbulent social structures.
