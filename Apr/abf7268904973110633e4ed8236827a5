By Modupe Oremule Lagos – With less than 14 hours to the commencement of the 2019 Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) U-18 and U-20 Championships, Team Nigeria was yet to get to host city Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. Team Nigeria, which left by road at the early hours of April 13, were
still at the Ghana-Cote d’Ivoire border., as at 12 noon on Monday due
to stopovers. An anonymous member of the team told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
on telephone that the journey was tiring, while some members of the
delegation also missed their way while on the journey. NAN reports that the championships, which hold from April 16 to April
20 in Abidjan, have no fewer than 86 youth and junior athletes
representing the country. According to the source, it is God and the zeal to do the country proud at the event that are still motivating the athletes. Some athletics enthusiasts, however, took to social media to express
their worries and displeasure, saying that they hoped the young athletes
would be able to excel in Cote d’Ivoire. Olu Akin said: “With this kind of stressful journey, I don’t think
the country should expect better result from the athletes; because some
other countries have been in Abidjan for over two days. “May God let them win medals and grant them safe journey to and fro,” he said. Peculiar Goody also wrote: “I pray for safe journey; but I think that fatigue will set in. Another enthusiast, Carol Ezekiel, wrote: “ The athletes will be tired with the event kicking off tomorrow, this is not fair. Henry Cyprian simply said: “God help my brothers and sisters of track and field. Goodluck to them,” he said.
