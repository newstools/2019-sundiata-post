Tokyo – A Japanese Court decided on Friday to allow prosecutors to hold ousted Nissan Motor Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, for an additional eight days. The Tokyo District Court said it had extended the detention of the 65-year-old through April 22. Ghosn was rearrested over breach of trust allegations. The defence team for Ghosn immediately filed an appeal against the court’s decision to detain him. Ghosn was first arrested in November
and has been charged with breach of trust and falsifying financial
documents in understating his income. He was released from the Tokyo
detention centre in early March after posting $9 million in bail money,
ending a stretch of over 100 days in custody. On Thursday, the prosecutors questioned his wife Carole Ghosn in the court with a judge and Carlos Ghosn’s defence team present. The lead defence lawyer, Junichiro
Hironaka, told reporters following her court appearance that her
response to the prosecutors “could help Mr Ghosn win an acquittal’’. Ghosn spearheaded a significant
turnaround at Nissan about 20 years ago, helping to revive the carmaker
from near bankruptcy under a capital alliance with Renault. Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors ousted
Ghosn as chairman following his arrest in November, while he was
resigned as chairman and chief executive of Renault in January. In a video statement on Tuesday,
Ghosn denied the allegations and blamed his arrest on what he called a
“conspiracy’’ and a “dirty game’’ by some Nissan executives.
