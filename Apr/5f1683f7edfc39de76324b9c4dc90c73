Santiago – The regional office of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on Wednesday presented its plan to fight poverty and hunger in Latin America and the Caribbean. The strategy, named “100 Territories Free of Poverty and Hunger,”
seeks to work with local governments to identify critical points that
require urgent attention in the region. “The first phase of the strategy focuses on five priority countries,
namely Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and the Dominican
Republic,’’ the FAO said. The 10-year plan foresees work with governments in the creation of a
coalition of important social partners from the private sector, academia
and the international community. The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and
the FAO have identified close to 2,000 municipalities in 14 countries
within the region that have over 40 million people living in extreme
poverty and suffering from food insecurity. “We are talking about municipalities in countries like Colombia,
Peru, the Dominican Republic or Brazil,’’ Julio Berdegue, FAO regional
representative, said. According to Berdegue, these countries have made significant advances
in their development, in whose forgotten territories there are still
children suffering from hunger. “These backward territories are like places stuck in time. “In addition, in the countries with the biggest advances there are
rural territories that have been left behind, where people live in
social conditions which resemble those of 50 years ago,’’ he said. Half of these people, the number of which is 20.9 million, live in
the countryside, while the rest live in towns and small cities. Almost one in five are indigenous or of African descent. “Data showed that the population of these backward territories
represents between 4 and 16 per cent of the total population,’’ the FAO
said.
