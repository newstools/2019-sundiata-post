No
fewer than 23 Nigerians are on the death row in Saudi Arabia, even as
controversy continues to attend the recent beheading of a Nigerian
woman, Kudirat Adeshola Afolabi, by Saudi authorities for drug
trafficking. The Nation has stumbled on a document listing 23 more Nigerians on the death row in Saudi Arabia. The
report quoted an official document as saying that the Nigerians were
found guilty of allegedly contravening the “Narcotic and Psychotropic
Substances Control Law, issued under Royal Decree No. M/39 dated
8/7/1428AH and is punishable with death penalty.” “Unfortunately, between 2016-2017, these Nigerians were arrested at King Abdul-Aziz International Airport, Jeddah and Prince Muhammad bin Abdu- Aziz International Airport, Madinah for smuggling narcotic drugs concealed in their rectums,” the document added.
