The Nigerian Senate has passed the 2019 Appropriation Bill, following the presentation of the bill by the Senate Committee on Appropriation. The chairman of the Committee, Danjuma Goje, announced an increase in the budget to 8.91 trillion â€“ N10 billion be provided to assist victims of Zamfara State crises and should be added to the total figures. The Senate had, last week, shifted the passage of the 2019 Appropriation Bill as a result of the absence of the Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee, Danjuma Goje and his deputy, Sonny Ogbuoji, to comment on the documents. Besides, the non-availability of copies on the details of the budget proposal to senators also contributed to the shift in date. Source News Express
