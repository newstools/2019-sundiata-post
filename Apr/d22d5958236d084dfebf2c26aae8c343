By Emmanuel Oloniruha Abuja – A Chieftain  of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benue, Mr John Tondu, has called for more synergy between the Federal Government and the Benue government aimed at finding lasting solution to cases of  killings in the state. Tondu, in an interview with newsmen on Monday in Abuja, said insecurity in Benue which had remained a major concern to all could be addressed with strong synergy between the Federal Government and governments at the lower level. “We are a nation and no state is isolated from the government at the centre. “What I can do is to appeal to both the state and the Federal Government to come together and see how there will be peace in Benue state and the entire country,’’ he said. “If you say we have witnessed an improvement in terms of security, that is not completely true, the reason being that as we speak, today most of those areas where there were issues, the people are living  in Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps,”Tondu, a former Commissioner for Land and Survey also a former PDP governorship aspirant in Benue, said “So, nobody is there, the people have actually left the place and because they are no longer in those locations, the land in question has been occupied. That explains why you are seeing massive killings. “So, if you say there are no killings, there are no killings because the people are not at home; so there is no improvement in security as it concerns the issue of Benue state, so it is a very serious issue. “As I speak with you, nobody is in my village, my people have left the village for over 15 months. “My house in the village has been razed down completely and I don’t know when my people will return to my village to carry out their farming activities,’’ Tondu said.(NAN)
