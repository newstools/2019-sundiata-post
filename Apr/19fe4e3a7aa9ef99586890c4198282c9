By Aderonke Ojediran Lagos – Yemisi Olatunji, Nigeria’s number one ranked female squash player says she opened a “Go Fund Me” account in order to attend competitions and boost her ranking in the Professional Squash Association (PSA). Olatunji, currently ranked 146 in the world, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that the response had being amazing, but it could be better. “I decided to open the Go Fund Me account because I can’t do this on my own any more, participating in PSA ranked competitions is the most fulfilling thing for player. “Because in such competitions, you are competing against the best in the game; I’m not comfortable with just being number one in Nigeria and I’m nowhere in the PSA. “Being a mediocre is not what I promised myself, so I’m going to keep pushing, we don’t have up to 10 PSA organised tournaments here. “People are responding but honestly I still need more generous donations towards my course, most of this competitions are held outside the country. “I can’t afford to do that on my own without the good people of Nigeria’s generous donation,’’ she said. Olatunji told NAN that her focus was to be among the first 50 female players in the world. “That’s my aim, top 50, that’s what I’m working towards achieving, and I strongly believe that I’d get there and maybe, surpass my own expectations who knows?” Asked if her PSA task will not make her less visible in the country’s squash circuit, the current best racket player in the country told NAN that it won’t. “PSA has a programme and the bodies governing squash both at the state and federal levels are aware of this programme, so it guides us, so there is a balance,’’ she said.
