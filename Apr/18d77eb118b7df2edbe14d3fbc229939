By Samuel Ajayi Tinubu told Ambode not to inaugurate the projects he initiated. “Leave them for SanwoOlu to complete and commission,” he said. Reports had it he told him twice. The outgoing governor refused. “I won’t allow someone else to take glory for what I started,” Ambode stated. Instead of being in town and won’t attend ceremony, Tinubu simply went abroad. But the loser is our body politics. We play politics even with our sleeping and waking up. Most, if not all, of the projects Buhari inaugurated last week were UNCOMPLETED. Even in a state not notorious for contract inflation, almost N10b will still be needed to complete these projects. Buhari was aware of this but he accepted to come and inaugurate them to spite Tinubu (or so I think). He personally intervened on Ambode’s behalf twice (sending a delegation down once) that the governor be given second term, but Tinubu vehemently refused. Now, to inaugurate the project, Fayemi (Ekiti), Amosun (Ogun), Akeredolu (Ondo) and Oyetola (Osun) all came which was more of a political statement than commissioning any project. Ambode may likely get a ministerial look-in after May 29 again to Tinubu’s anger. Now SanwoOlu would complete the projects and over hundred million naira will be spent again to inaugurate them. Dem don swear for our politicians… Source: Facebook
