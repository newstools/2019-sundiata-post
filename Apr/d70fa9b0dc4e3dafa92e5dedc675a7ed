Chinedu Nweze, a man in his late 30s, in Ebonyi State, has set himself ablaze out of frustration. The incident which took place beside
one of the classroom blocks at St. Patrick Primary School, Kpirikpiri,
on Saturday, attracted many sympathisers. An eyewitness who pleaded anonymity,
said a man whom she described as her neighbour at Umuoghara village,
Ezza North Local Government Area of the state, said the victim sometimes
manifested mental illness but noted that no one thought it would lead
to suicide attempt. Nigerian Tribune also gathered that
Nweze before setting self ablaze, had tied both legs with a rope, before
he poured petrol all over his body. A container with a substance
suspected to be petrol and a box of matches used in the act were
discovered on the spot where Nweze was wriggling in pain. However, the police who got a distress call arrived at the scene and acted promptly by taking Nwezeâ€™s body to Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, where he is currently receiving treatment.(newsexpressngr)
