By Oladele Eniola Lagos – A movie producer, Seun Dania, on Wednesday urged film makers  to always pass relevant and right  messages across to their fans, especially, the youth. Dania told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that some
Nollywood movies were fond of sending wrong and irrelevant messages to
their supporters. “As movie producers or directors, we must ensure that the movies we
are directing; convey the right and relevant messages to their
audience, especially, the youth of our country. “We must bear it in mind that different movies will have different impacts on people, especially, the youth. “So, we must learn how to pass the right and meaningful messages in our movies. “We cannot be encouraging the use of drugs or the promotion of
violence in our movies. We will be passing wrong messages to our youths. “Film makers must learn to use their movies as a tool to correct the social ills or vices in our society.” he said. Dania, the executive producer of the movie ‘Nimbe’, noted that the
movie was produced to help curb the rise in drug abuse and hooliganism
among youths in the country. “The essence of this movie is to equip the youth with functional
knowledge and understanding of the consequences of drug abuse, rape and
gender-based violence. “The movie will help to trigger an attitudinal change in the
lifestyles of our youths and also help them to make the best judgments
when required.” he said.
