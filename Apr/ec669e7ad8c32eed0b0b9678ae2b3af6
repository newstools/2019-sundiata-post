Berlin â€“ A man and a woman have been fined $8,400 for having sex in the middle of the day on a Berlin train, a court spokesman said on Thursday. The incident took place on a Sunday in April, 2018. Police at the time said the man and woman were performing oral sex in full view of passengers, including children, on a train heading into the city centre. Witnesses reportedly intervened, leading to a physical altercation that eventually prompted one passenger to pull the emergency brake. The man and woman were arrested at the scene. The 37-year-old woman was fined 3,900 euros and the 39-year-old man 3,600 euros, according to the decision, which was handed down on April 10. (dpa/NAN)
