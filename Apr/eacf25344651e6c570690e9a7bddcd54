Seoul – A North Korea has warned the U.S. of “unwanted consequences’’ unless it changes stance on how to achieve denuclearisation of Korean Peninsula, South Korean media reported on Tuesday. According to North Korea’s First Vice Foreign Minister, Choe Hui, Pyongyang will only be able to carry out denuclearisation when the U.S. changes its current way of calculation and re-establishes its stance. Talks between both countries are in limbo after U.S. President, Donald Trump and North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, failed to agree on key points regarding denuclearisation, at a summit in Hanoi in February. Kim has since accused Washington of acting in “bad faith’’ at his second meeting with Trump. Washington wants Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons while North Korea is seeking the lifting of international sanctions that have stifled its economy. “North Korea wanted to see a change in U.S. policy by the end of the year,’’ the report quoted Choe as saying. Her remarks come days after U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said in a US television interview that Washington could “change paths” if talks with Pyongyang broke down. (dpa/NAN)
