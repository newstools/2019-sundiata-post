By Aderonke Ojediran Lagos – Rotimi George-Taylor, a former President of the Nigeria Boxing Federation (NBF) on Friday called on boxing administrators to be more proactive in their activities, in order to be able to develop the sport. George-Taylor made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. He urged the board to organise periodic and regular competitions for
its referees and coaches, in other to impact the players with their
newly-acquired redefined skills. “There is need for deliberate action: How often are there clinical
programmes? Are coaches going for trainings as they should? We should
always endeavor to get our priorities right. “A boxer is as good as his coach. We should pay attention to these
things and oftentimes, we tend to forget these things, to the extent
that the training of coaches is sometimes underestimated. “Then again, do we have the right size of rings? Do we have the right
training equipment for these boxers? We need to be deliberate about
such issues,’’ he said. The former NBF president also urged the country’s representative at
the International Boxing Association (IBA) to utilise their
representation to attract development and growth to the game in the
country. “What assistance, what benefits have we gotten for being affiliated
to the IBA? We need to take full advantage of these platforms. “We can get the best training easily through our affiliation with the international body,’’ he added.
