Brussels – The European Commission charged Valve, the owner of a video distribution platform and five game publishers on Friday with preventing EU consumers from shopping around within the European Union to find the best deal for the games they offer. The case is the latest move by EU antitrust regulators against
cross-border curbs on online trade, key to what is seen as a major part
of economic growth in the 28-country bloc. The commission, which oversees competition policy in the 28 EU
countries, said that the companies were Valve Corp., the owner of the
world’s largest video game distribution platform ‘Steam’ and five game
makers – Bandai Namco, Capcom, Focus Home, Koch Media and ZeniMax. “In a true digital single market, European consumers should have the
right to buy and play video games of their choice regardless of where
they live in the EU,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe
Vestager said. The commission has sent what it calls a “statement of objections” to
the companies, allowing them to reply and request hearings to present
their arguments. Companies found guilty of anti-competitive behavior can be fined up to 10 per cent of their annual global turnover. The commission said it was concerned that Valve and the five game
publishers agreed to prevent cross-border sales by geo-blocking the
‘activation keys’ that enable consumers to be able to play games. This may have prevented consumers from buying cheaper games available in other EU countries. EU antitrust regulators opened its investigation in February 2017, at
the same time also looking into online sales of electronics and hotel
rooms. EU rules prohibit geographically based restrictions that undermine
online shopping and cross-border sales. Last month, it fined Nike for
blocking cross-border sales of soccer merchandise.
