Davido, Afro-pop singer and song writer, says he is taking a one-month break from his phone and social media to hasten the completion of his forthcoming album. The 26-year-old singer said this through a video shared on Instagram. The award-winning singer established contact routes for those who intend reaching out within the said period. “For everybody that has been trying to reach me on my phone, WhatsApp or Whatsoever, I have decided to go phone-less for the next month just so I can finish my album and focus on things I need to focus on,” Davido said. “So If you’re trying to reach me, call Lati (His Personal Assistant).” Davido forced to leave instagram for a month in preparation for his album A post shared by  Naija celebs lifestyle videos👍 (@nigerian_celebrities_videos) on Apr 13, 2019 at 5:52am PDT Many Nigerian celebrities have countlessly deemed social media a distraction for their career struggles and have leveraged on social absence to hasten ongoing projects. In January 2019, Sarz, Nigerian record producer, revealed how he curbed his “social media addiction” to maximize productivity and finally completed his long-awaited EP ‘SINYM’. “Before this project, I noticed I was addicted to social media. It was really bad! You couldn’t separate me from my phone and most of my days were unproductive. I decided to do something about it and I went off social media for months,” he had said. “I made this project in 2 weeks.This is something I wouldn’t have been able to do if I was active on social media because all it takes is one notification and my creative process is gone.” Similarly, Simisola Ogunleye, Nigerian songstress also said the practice of jumping on trending topics in a bid to be seen as relevant can become addictive. “Social media is a drug. You always want a fix. Whatever is trending, you jump on – whether or not it makes sense to, you jump on it, because everyone else is jumping on it,” she revealed in a tweet. TheCable
