By Polycarp Auta Jos – The Plateau Chapter of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), has urged Gov. Simon Lalong to develop the sport sector in the state. Mr Agabus Pwanagba, the Secretary of the Association in the state,
gave the advice on Monday in a congratulatory message to the governor
over his re-election. According to Pwanagba, Plateau had over time remained the hub of
talent hunt in the country, hence the need for the governor to pay more
attention in developing the sector during his second tenure. The secretary acknowledged Lalong’s support to football and golf
games, but advised him to expand the scope of his support to other
sporting activities to restore the lost glory of the state as the “Home
of Sports”. “SWAN wish to congratulate Gov. Simon Lalong over his re-election bid. “We want to urge the incumbent administration to focus on total
overhauling of sports infrastructure in the state during its second
tenure. “The state has been the hub of hunting for talented athletes when
sporting infrastructures were all available, but today, the story is
gradually changing. “No doubt,  the incumbent governor has given much support to football
and golf, but spreading it to other sports will restore those old
glorious days, to help develop the sector,” he urged. The secretary said the association further calling on the governor,
who is also its Grand Patron, to focus on sports development at the
grassroots, with a view to identifying , nurturing and encouraging young
talents. He expressed optimism that sports,  if properly harnessed,  would
 help the Lalong-led administration in engaging the youth and stemming
restiveness
