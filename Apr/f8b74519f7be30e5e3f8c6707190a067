Abuja (Sundiata Post) – A Ghanaian woman has
reportedly collapsed after she came face to face with her husband who had died two
years ago. The said man was seen in the company of another
young woman, who reportedly is his girlfriend. According to reports, the woman traced the lovebirds
to a guesthouse upon sighting them. She confirmed with the hotel manager who
told her the husband and the girlfriend had checked into the guesthouse the
previous night. She wasted no time in calling the police. However, upon police arriving at the scene, the
man and the girlfriend were found dead. “They came in very drunk and started kissing as
soon as we gave them the keys but we don’t know what happened next,” the
guesthouse manager says. The police commander at Kwaku told Joy
FM. “We rushed to the scene as soon as we received
a call from the woman. We found her husband with a 25-year-old lady who was
also dead. We believe their death was caused by over-excitement but we’re still
investigating,” the commander says. Source: Information Nigeria
