By Kelly Kinkade One of the best ways to ensure that you will not get a US visa is to go into the interview process with the intention of pursuing some scheme or trick to obtain the visa. Here’s the thing: Consider any scheme, strategy, or trick that someone else suggests to you. Do you really think that you’re the first person that person has suggested this trick to? Of course not. Which means that this trick has been taught to someone else, who (most likely) has tried to use it. Which means that the consular officer that you try it on has either seen it before himself or herself, or at least has been briefed on it by one of the other officers who has. Your trick will be old hat to them: they will see through it instantly. And you can guess where that leads. Thus, the trick to getting a US student visa is to understand that there is no trick. Just go in there and tell the plain truth. Any other strategy is a short cut to denial.
