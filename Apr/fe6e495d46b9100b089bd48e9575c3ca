London – One of Britain’s top universities announced a two-year inquiry into its links to the African slave trade on Tuesday, promising to uncover how the institution may have gained from slavery and the exploitation of labour. Scholars at the University of Cambridge will examine archives and
other records to determine how it might have benefited from slavery
through financial and other bequests to departments, libraries and
museums. They will also investigate how scholarship at the university might
have reinforced and validated race-based thinking between the 18th and
early 20th century. They will also investigate when Britain was a colonial power involved
in slave-trading, mainly from western Africa to the Caribbean and the
Americas. “An advisory group will recommend appropriate ways to publicly
acknowledge past links to slavery and to address its impact,’’ the
university said. “There is growing public and academic interest in the links between the older British universities and the slave trade. “It is only right that Cambridge should look into its own exposure to
the profits of coerced labour during the colonial period,’’ Prof.
Stephen Toope, the university’s vice chancellor said. Martin Millett, a professor of classical archaeology, who heads the
advisory group, said the benefits to the university “may have been
financial or through other gifts.’’ “But the panel is just as interested in the way scholars at the
university helped shape public and political opinion, supporting,
reinforcing and sometimes contesting racial attitudes which are
repugnant in the 21st Century,’’ Millett said.
