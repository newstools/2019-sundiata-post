By Cecilia Ijuo Abuja – The Senate on Wednesday passed  a bill for an Act to Prohibit Gas Flaring in Nigeria. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Bassey Apkan was passed after a clause-by-clause consideration at plenary. The bill, which passed second reading in 2017, seeks to ensure that any person who acted on  behalf of a licensee to supply inaccurate data to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) or to any other person duly empowered by a lawful authority, commits an offence. Such a person should  be liable upon conviction to a fine of N10 million or to imprisonment for a maximum term of six months or to both fine and imprisonment. The bill also contained  provisions on inaccurate data collation and submission by the lessee, gas flaring fee, powers of the minister to make regulations, as well as repeal of the Associated  Gas Re-Injection Act 2004. It equally seeks  to ensure that natural gas is not flared or vented in any oil and gas production operation, bloc or field, onshore or onshore, or gas facility. The bill also seeks  to ensure that no operator should  establish an oil and gas facility in Nigeria without obtaining  authorisation from the minister  for the design phase, the commissioning and the production phases. The President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, put the bill to voice vote and it was adopted by the lawmakers.(NAN)
