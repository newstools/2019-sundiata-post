Oputa noted that he would ensure the success of Ihedioha when he fully comes on board from May 29. Charly Boy   Embattled convener of OurMumuDonDo movement, Charles Oputa also known as Charlyboy, has relocated to his home state, Imo, from Abuja.   The activist also known as ‘Area Fada’ told reporters in Owerri yesterday that the decision to relocate was to turn his searchlight and support to Imo governor-elect, Emeka Ihedioha, before and during his administration. The maverick entertainer disclosed that he purposely relocated from Abuja to his home because he was not allowed to express himself freely in Abuja by prohibitive forces.   His words: “I am back to Imo State, my home, to beam my searchlight on Ihedioha’s administration. You know Imo people have suffered since the last eight years.”   Oputa noted that he would ensure the success of Ihedioha when he fully comes on board from May 29. According to him, his group, other Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), retirees and other frustrated Imo people would storm Ihedioha’s residence during the week to ask him how he intends to ensure that numerous unemployed persons in the state have jobs.   He warned the governor-elect to be mindful of the major pitfalls of the Rochas Okorocha administration. Charly Boy, however, expressed reservations on some people in the Transition Technical Committee (TTC) and the Inauguration Committee of the governor-elect.   He advised Ihedioha to be careful in order not to make further mistakes.   He said he assumed the presidency of Association of Frustrated Nigerians (AFN) because there were too many Nigerians who had been suffering that needed help.
