Having previously won the Premier League and La Liga, the Portuguese has now added the Serie A title to his collection with new club Juventus. Cristiano Ronaldo has done it again! Different country, same result: a domestic title for the Portuguese superstar. With Juventus having clinched the Scudetto with a 2-1 win over Fiorentina on Saturday, Ronaldo has become the first man to win Europeâ€™s three major leagues: Serie A, La Liga and the Premier League. The significance of this latest success will, of course, be debated. Firstly, it has arrived just four days after a demoralising Champions League elimination at the hands of a far more exciting but far less expensively assembled Ajax side.
