provide social services in the field of education through its schools
which are opened to every confession, religion and background. “In thanking God for all that have been accomplished, I encourage
Catholics and Christians to be servants, promoters and defenders of
human fraternity in Morocco,” Welcoming the Pope earlier, King Mohammed said “our faith teaches us to love our fellow human beings and to help them. “Because God is love, I have tried to make sure my reign is
characterised by closeness to citizens as well as resisting the poorest
and most vulnerable people, ” the King said. NAN reports that there are more than 120,000 Christians in Morocco with about 37 million population. Pope Francis, Head of the Catholic Church and Sovereign of the
