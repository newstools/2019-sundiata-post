He said that the defendant bolted with a Ford Ranger pickup car belonging to Visionscape Sanitation, Lagos. “The defendant was sent on errand but he ran away with the car. “Efforts made by the company’s management to get the car proved unsuccessful as the defendant refused to answer his calls. “When the tracking system was conducted, the defendant was arrested in Enugu State with the car. “The stolen car was recovered from him,’’ the prosecutor said. The offence violated Section 287 (10) of the Criminal Law of Lagos
State, 2015, which stipulates seven years imprisonment for stealing. The case was adjourned until May 15, for mention.
