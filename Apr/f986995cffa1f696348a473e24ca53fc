London – Britain will block China’s Huawei Technologies from all core parts of the 5G network and access to non-core parts will be restricted, a security source said on Wednesday. Huawei, the world’s biggest producer of telecoms equipment, is under
intense scrutiny after the U.S. told allies not to use its technology
because of fears it could be a vehicle for Chinese spy operations. The Daily Telegraph reported that Britain would allow Huawei limited access to the network. Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of Britain’s Foreign Affairs Committee,
said it was very difficult to make a distinction between the core and
non-core in 5G due to the way the network is built. “It still raises concerns, definition of core and non-core is a very difficult one with 5G. “The 5G does change from a faster internet system into an internet
system that can genuinely connect everything, and therefore the
distinction between non-core and core is much harder to make,” he told
BBC Radio. In what some have compared to the Cold War arms race, the U.S. is
worried that 5G dominance would give any global competitor such as China
an advantage Washington is not ready to accept. According to senior Western cyber experts, 5G, which will offer much
faster data speeds and become the foundation stone of many industries
and networks, is a revolutionary technology.
