By Ifeoma Aka Enugu – Enugu State House of Assembly on Tuesday stepped down consideration of joint committee report on a bill for a law to eliminate violence in private and public life and other related matters.The Leader of the house, Mr Ikechukwu Ezeugwu, moved a motion at the plenary for the report to be stepped down for lack of proper numbering, while Ezenta Ezeani (PDP Igbo Etiti East) seconded the motion.Ezeugwu said that the report should be stepped down to enable the joint committee on Youth, Sports and Security Matters, Gender Affairs and Social Development and Judiciary, Public Petitions, Ethics and Privileges to do the needful on the report.He said that the essence of the bill was for a law to help eliminate violence in private and public life, prohibit all forms of violence, including physical, sexual, psychological, domestic and harmful traditional practices.He said that the bill when passed would put a stop to discrimination against persons, provide maximum protection, effective remedies for victims and punishment for offenders.News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the leader’s observation came shortly after Mr Nelson Uduji (PDP Awgu South), the chairman of the joint committee, presented the report for a clause to clause consideration at a committee of the whole. NAN also reports that this is the second time the bill was being stepped down by the house. The Violence Against Persons Prohibited (VAPP) bill being sponsored by an Enugu based NGO, Women Aid Collective (WACOL), is seeking domestication of the Act already passed by the National Assembly in Enugu State. The speaker of the house, Chief Edward Ubosi, urged the joint committee to take back the report, do the necessary corrections and report back to the house in three days.Ubosi said that he noticed that the report was done during the primary elections, when the attention of the committee members was divided.The house was later adjourned to reconvene on Thursday, April 4.
