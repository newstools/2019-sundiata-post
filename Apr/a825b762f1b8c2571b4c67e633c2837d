In Nigeria the Executive, comprising of the Presidency and including all the leading organs and agencies of the Federal Government, are headed by northerners. The Legislature, comprising of the two arms of the National Assembly, namely the Senate and the House of Reps, are headed by northerners. The Judiciary, comprising of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the Federal High Court, are headed by northerners. All of the 17 military, paramilitary and security agencies except for the Navy are headed by northerners. I really do wonder whether anyone in his or her right senses can describe this as being reasonable or fair? To add to the mix consider this: In the history of Nigeria only two CJNâ€™s have been removed from office. They were both southerners and they were both removed by northerners. The first was Justice Taslim Elias who was removed by Murtala Mohammed and the second is Justice Onnoghen who was removed by Muhammadu Buhari.
