Brussels – The number of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in the European Union totalled around 19,700 in 2018, around a third fewer than 2017, the EU statistics agency Eurostat reported on Friday. That total marks the third straight year of falling numbers and is
close to pre-2015 levels, before the migration surge to Europe from the
Middle East and Africa. In 2014, this group totalled around 23,100, before spiking to 95,200 in 2015. “Of the 2018 total, 86 per cent were male, and around three-quarters were age 16 to 17. “The top countries of origin were Afghanistan, Eritrea, Pakistan and Syria,’’ Eurostat said. Among destination countries, Germany and Italy led the EU, taking in about four in 10 applicants. This group, defined as under-18 and lacking the supervision of a
responsible adult, represents around 10 per cent of all asylum
applicants under age 18. The vast majority of children arrive accompanied by family members.
