By Adenike Ayodele Ikeja – An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday ordered that four unemployed who allegedly armed themselves with a locally made gun and robbed pedestrians at gun point be remanded in prison. Chief Magistrate O.A. Layinka, remanded Chimezie Bright, 22;
Babangida Abdullahi, 25; Toheeb Adeboye; 20 and Habeeb Olayinka 19 in
Kirikiri Prison. Layinka ordered the police to duplicate the case file to the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for legal advice. She adjourned the case until May 15 for DPP’s advice. Earlier, the Police Prosecutor, ASP Akeem Raji, alleged that the
defendants armed with a locally-made gun and a-three-edged knife, robbed
Mr Oluwadamilola Asa and Mr Augustine Arafie of their money and phones
worth N37, 000. Raji told the court that the defendants committed the offence with
others who are at large on Feb.14 about 9.30 p.m. at College Road Bus
Stop, Fagba in Ifako, Lagos. He said the defendants robbed the complainants of an Itel phone
valued at N13, 000, N14, 000 cash and a MBO cell phone worth N10, 000. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of sections 297 and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015, (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that conspiracy attracts two
years imprisonment, while robbery attracts a 21-year-jail term if
convicted.
