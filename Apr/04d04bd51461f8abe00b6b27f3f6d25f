Many have been accusing me of allowing other tribes to “insult” Yoruba on my wall because of Buhari. I always laugh. Before anything, kindly consider the list below: Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola
Olusegun Obasanjo
Olabiyi Durojaye
Oluwayemisi Falae
Frederick Fasehun
Beko Ransom-Kuti
Oladipo Diya
Gabriel Ajayi
Baba Omojola
Ola Oni
Babafemi Ojudu
Gani Fawehinmi
Femi Falana
Tajudeen Olanrewaju
Seun Fadipe And then these: (The unlucky ones)
Kudirat Abiola
Suliat Adedeji
Sola Omosola
Alfred Rewane (Itsekiri with strong ties to Yoruba) They never lived to tell the story of the Abacha Tyranny. (The lucky ones)
Abraham Adesanya
Ayo Adebanjo
Alex Ibru (Deltan) They lived to tell the story. But they were bruised forever. These guys were at one time or the other in detention under General Sani Abacha. In fact, there was a time all of them were in gaol, safe for one or two. And the unlucky ones paid the supreme price! If you take Diya and Fadipe (who you could accuse of planning coup) their offence was simple: THEY STOOD AGAINST TYRANNY AND BAD GOVERNANCE. WHILE OTHERS CHOSE TO PLAY SAFE, THEY RISKED THEIR LIVES. INCLUDING THOSE OF LOVED ONES! Gani was faithful to this until his death in September 2009. Same for Beko. It is sickening that today, you see intellectuals and educated folks from that SAME golden tribe known for its principled stance for justice and equity now defending obvious and glaring MIS-GOVERNANCE and INJUSTICE. They not only justify it, they rationalise it by referring you to when another government was doing it. Now, you want me to stand up and be pretending that all is well with the Yoruba race with the way we are handling the Buhari regime? No. I won’t. You can vote for a particular leader or party. But to constantly trying to explain inadequacies even the blind can see is not patriotism. Source: Facebook
