Ini Edo‘s fashion is always on-point! On and off the red carpet she knows how to work every look to fit her body and her personal style.She strutted her stuff this weekend at the #Gladysian1319 wedding in a pastel blue and pink power suit set by Julyet Peters. This is not the first colour or outfit most of us would choose to put together for a wedding, but it works and gives her a comfortable but seriously glam boost. She keeps her accessories pretty and complimentary; gold jewelry, a deep blue Louis Vuitton clutch, and tortilla brown Louboutin heels.She tops her look off with stunning gold braids styled in an updo – beauty queen style and a sleek, subtle glam makeup.
