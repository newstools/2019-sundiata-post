An American lady has taken to twitter to write about a bold Nigerian Man who sent her a private message on Twitter asking that she marry him so that he can move to America, find a better life, then divorce later. She said that she wasn’t rude to him but was against the marriage and divorce plan. Instead she is now helping him gain scholarship to American schools where he can study and work at the same time. The tweet is currently gaining traction on Twitter especially from Nigerians who are obviously impressed by the lady’s kind gesture. See tweet below:
