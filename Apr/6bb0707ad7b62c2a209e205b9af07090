General Manager of the National Theatre, Dr Stella Oyedepo, is dead, Qed.ng has learnt. The playwright and former director of the Kwara State Council for Arts and Culture died in an accident on Easter Monday on her way to Lagos from Ilorin. Dr Oyedepo was appointed GM in April 2018. She died on the first anniversary of her appointment. Her body has been deposited in the morgue while her driver and personal assistant, who were travelling with her, have been admitted in a hospital. The House of Representatives Committee on Tourism and Culture earlier this month queried her for spending N29 million to renovate toilets. A source at the theatre told Qed.ng that a former general manager of the theatre had threatened her that she would not spend more than a year in office.(Qed)
