… Meet Senators-Elect For 9th
Senate By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja
(Sundiata Post) – As Nigerians await the election of the principal officers
that would pilot the affairs of the 9th Assembly in June, a lot of
permutations, horse-trading, alignments and realignments are on-going at both
inter and intra-party levels that will throw up a surprise in who emerges
senate president. While the
leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has told all who cared
to listen that no leadership positions, including committee chairmanship
positions would go to the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP), the latter
is holding its joker close to its chest. However,
in what looked like a revelation into what to expect from the PDP at the floor
of the senate when it is time to elect leaders of the 9th Senate,
Engr. Buba Galadima while on AIT program couple of days ago, reminded that if
the ruling party is not careful, that his party (PDP) would get the senate
president position as his party (PDP) has about 44 senators against the ruling party’s
63 thereabout. It is
imperative to note that the outcome of the election by the senators may be a
surprise to many as the calibre of senators-elect for the 9th senate
is not new to the politics of Nigeria. These are past governors, captains of
industries, ranking senators and past ministers. They are not men that would
take dictations from godfathers as many of them are political godfathers
themselves and would not want to be under the control of a proxy senate leader. These are the senators-elect for the
9th Senate. 1. Kalu Orji Uzor
