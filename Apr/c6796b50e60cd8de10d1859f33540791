IT WAS REGINA’S CHOICE AND WE RESPECT IT. BUT WHAT INFLUENCED THAT CHOICE? I had to ponder for over 24 hours before writing this. It is this Regina Daniel girl issue. I have read on many walls, especially those of ladies, defending the “choice” the girl made. I too surely RESPECT it. But that does NOT mitigate the hypocrisy with which women of nowadays analyse issues. I repeat: HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS WILL KILL MANY OF US! Now take these: Having said this, those who are defending Regina can go on and and do all the talking about respecting choices. We all respect her choice. But deep inside you, you know the reason behind that choice: M-O-N-E-Y!
