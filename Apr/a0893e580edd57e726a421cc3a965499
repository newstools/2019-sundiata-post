Nollywood actress Tonto Dikeh has made new revelations about her female colleagues in the Nigerian movie industry. The actress who was a guest on Planet TV Africa’s One on One talk show spoke about everything from her career as an actress and singer to her friendship with popular crossdresser Bobrisky. Fielding a question from the show’s host about fake love in the entertainment industry, the mother of one said that everyone is all fighting for the same thing, including same men, clothes and movie roles. The repeated cycle according to her, is enough reason to be discouraged from building friendships with people who crave the same things that she possesses. Dikeh said: “We are all fighting for the same thing. It is a cycle, we share; the same men, same clothes, same movie. So why would you want to be friends with someone who wants your life?” When asked if female actresses in the movie industry recycle men, she audaciously said : “of course that is what we do”
