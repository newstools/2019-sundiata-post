Washington – World Bank’s new President David Malpass will be making his first foreign trip to sub-Saharan Africa to highlight his vision for the bank’s poverty reduction and development agenda, the bank said on Friday A World Bank spokesman said in Washington that Malpass would be
traveling this weekend to Madagascar, Ethiopia and Mozambique before
flying to Egypt and a debt conference in Paris. Malpass was quoted as saying that Africa was a key priority for the
bank, due to its high concentration of the world’s poorest people. The bank spokesman, who preferred anonymity, said leaders of two of
the countries on Malpass’ trip, Ethiopia and Mozambique, were among a
number of African leaders also attending this year’s China’s second Belt
and Road infrastructure summit. Malpass, who was the Treasury’s undersecretary for international
affairs, is a longtime critic of China’s Belt and Road lending practices
and had worked to raise alarms about them with G7 and G20 countries in
that role. Malpass said at the IMF and World Bank spring meetings this month
that meeting the development lender’s goals of ending extreme poverty by
2030 called for a focus on Africa. “By 2030, nearly 9 in 10 extremely poor people will be Africans, and
half of the world’s poor will be living in fragile and conflict-affected
settings,” he told a news conference at the meetings. “This calls for urgent action by countries themselves and by the global community.” He told reporters on his first day on the job that he wanted to
“evolve” the bank’s relationship with China to one where Beijing is a
bigger contributor of capital and cooperates more closely with the bank
on development issues and poverty reduction. Nearly 40 world leaders and scores of finance officials, including
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde are
gathered in Beijing for the infrastructure summit.
