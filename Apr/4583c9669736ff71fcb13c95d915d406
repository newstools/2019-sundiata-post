By Aisha Gambo Kaduna – A landlady, Hope Ogbonna, on Thursday begged a Sharia Court sitting at Magajin Gari in Kaduna, to assist her recover a room occupied by a tenant, one Francis Gora. The complainant, a resident of Gonin-Gora area of Kaduna, told the court that the defendant had failed to pay the N80,000 annual rent and had locked the room and traveled. She prayed the court to assist her to open the room so that she could make use of it. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the defendant was not in court due to the inability of the court’s bailiff to locate and serve him. The Judge, Musa Sa’ad-Goma, adjourned the case until April 29, and ordered the complainant to present witnesses to confirm her claims. (NAN)
