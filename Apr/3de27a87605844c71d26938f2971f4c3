Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State remained on course for re-election on Tuesday evening as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) adjourned the collation of results of the March 9 governorship election in the state, which resumed on Tuesday morning amidst tight security. As at about 5:30 p.m. when the State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Obo Effanga, announced that the exercise would continue tomorrow, results from 15 of the 23 LGAs in the state had been declared, with Wike of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) clearing all but two. The only exceptions were Oyigbo and Akuku Toru LGAs won by his closest challenger, Engr. Biokpomabo Awara of the African Action Congress (AAC). Below are the results so far for the two leading contenders in the governorship race in which the federal-ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is banned by the courts due to internal wrangling: PHALGA LGA 20 WardsRegistered Voters – 485,238 Accredited Voters – 57,183, AAC – 11,866 PDP – 40,197 Total Valid Votes – 55,523 Rejected Votes – 1,620 Total Vote Cast – 57,143 Ikwerre LGA 13 Wards, Elections did not hold in 2 Wards Registered Voters – 151,390 Accredited Voters – 22,885 AAC – 5,660 PDP – 14,938 Rejected Votes – 1,125 Total Votes Cast – 22,885 Andoni LGA 11 Wards Total Registered Voters – 124,316 Accredited Voters – 102,959 AAC – 5,335 PDP – 92,056 Total Valid Votes – 101,481 Rejected Votes – 1,446 Total Votes Cast – 102,927 Oyigbo LGA 10 Wards Total Registered Voters – 109,095 Accredited Voters – 42,317 AAC – 32,026 PDP – 8,652 Total Valid Votes 41,984 Total Rejected Votes – 333 Total Votes Cast – 42,317 Eleme LGA 10 Wards 2 Wards Cancelled due to Violence Registered Voters – 89,751 Accredited Voters – 16,040 AAC – 2,748 PDP 9,560 Valid Votes 14,349 Rejected Votes 1,691 Total Votes Cast 16,040 2 Wards Cancelled Total Registered voters 27581Total Affected Polling Units 24 Opobo Nkoro LGA 11 Wards Registered 52,069 Accredited 11,468 AAC – 3,888 PDP – 6,314 Total Valid Votes – 10,864 Total Votes Cast – 11,178 Number of Polling Units Cancelled – 19 Registered Voters – 7,030 Bonny LGA 12 Wards 2 Wards Cancelled Registered Voters – 59,746 Accredited Voter – 15,830 AAC – 3,046 PDP – 10,551 Total Valid Votes – 14,509 Rejected Votes – 469 Total Cast – 14,978 17 Polling Units Affected with – 12,079 Okrika LGA12 Wards Registered Voters – 73,803 Accredited Voters – 31,609 AAC – 3,803 PDP – 25,572 Total Valid Votes – 31,078 Rejected Votes – 531 Total Votes Cast – 31,609 Akuku Toru LGA Total Registered Voters –  92,577 Accredited Voters –  67,855 AAC – 36,661 PDP – 25,765 Valid Votes – 67,009 Rejected Votes – 706 Votes Cast – 67,715 Omuma LGA 10 Wards Registered Voters – 60,662 Accredited Voters – 18,975 AAC – 1,853 PDP – 15,792 Valid Votes – 18,429 Rejected Votes – 203 Total Votes Cast – 18,623 Polling Units Affected 28 across 8 Wards Registered Voters – 9,627 Tai LGA 10 Wards No Election in one Ward Registered Voters – 71,519 Accredited Voters – 50,437 AAC – 540 PDP – 47,652 Valid Votes -49,234 Rejected Votes – 1,203 Total Votes Cast – 50,437 Ahoada East LGA 13 Wards Registered Voters – 82,858 Accredited Voters – 19,575 AAC – 3,713 PDP – 14,589 Valid Votes – 19,125 Rejected Votes – 450 Votes Cast – 19,575 Emohua LGA 14 Wards No Election in 3 Wards Registered Voters – 124,080 Accredited Voters – 80,724 AAC – 2,856 PDP – 71,522 Valid Votes – 77,619 Rejected Votes – 3,105 Votes Cast – 80,724 Etche LGA 19 Wards No Election in 1 of the Wards Registered Voters – 107,502 Accredited Voters – 22,536 AAC – 7,437 PDP – 11,842 Valid Votes – 20,340 Rejected Votes – 714 Total Votes Cast – 21,054 Onelga LGA 17 Wards, Collation done for 13 Wards Registered Voters – 112,631 Accredited Voters – 43,024 AAC – 8,423 PDP – 31,277 Valid Votes – 41,705 Rejected Votes – 1,319 Votes Cast – 43,024 Source News Express
