Prophet Kofi Oduro, the Head pastor of Alabaster International Ministry, Ghana, has lectured his female church members on how to maintain their marriages. The cleric demonstrated to his congregation how married women should dress to keep their marriages romantic, by wearing sexy panties and nighties as against tying wrappers and wearing grandma panties. “Most married women lose themselves when they get married. To every married woman here, if you want to maintain your marriage you have to raise your game. The fact that you are married doesn’t mean you don’t have to be sexy or romantic. The side chicks are wearing sexy panties to snatch your husbands,“ he advised.
