The US department of state has warned its citizens to reconsider traveling to Nigeria saying violent crime, such as armed robbery, assault, carjacking, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, rape and piracy are common in the country. This was contained in a travel advisory released on its website, which contains information on the safety and security of US travellers. Nigeria was listed among 35 countries with a “K” indicator to signify locations where its citizens could be at risk of getting kidnapped or taken hostage. “The new “K” indicator is part of our ongoing commitment to provide clear and comprehensive travel safety information to U.S. citizens so they can make informed travel decisions,” the department said. “The Travel Advisories for 35 countries have been updated to include a ‘K’ indicator for the risk of kidnapping and/or hostage taking: “Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Mali, Mexico, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Russian Federation, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine (in Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine), Venezuela, and Yemen. “The security situation in northeast Nigeria is fluid and unpredictable, particularly in Borno and Yobe States and northern Adamawa State. “Terrorist groups based in the Northeast target churches, schools, mosques, government installations, educational institutions, and entertainment venues. Approximately two million of Nigerians have been displaced as a result of the violence in northeast Nigeria.”
