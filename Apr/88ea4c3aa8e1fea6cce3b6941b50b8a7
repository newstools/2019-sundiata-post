By Joseph Edeh Abuja – A retired Commissioner of Police, Mr Lawrence Alobi, has attributed frequent misuse of firearms by policemen, including extra-judicial killings, to frustration and hostile work environment. Alobi told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Abuja, that
most policemen were not appreciated in spite of working in very hostile
environment and frustrated. “`You know frustration breeds anger; their rights are not being given to them,’’ he said. According to Alobi, aside hostile work environment, policemen are
dehumanised and not properly funded and equipped to discharge their
constitutional mandate. “ The policeman is not given adequate training as it ought to be;
training builds professionalism and it comes by practical application
and not by word,“ he said. He said that policemen needed training on democratic policing and
emotional intelligence for them to know when to control their emotions. “If they imbibe these core values and they are adequately motivated,
equipped and funded, they will not abuse the use of firearms,’’ the
former police boss said. The Acting Inspector-General of Police (I-G), Mr Mohammed Adamu,
recently directed that policemen across the country should work eight
hours daily to curtail work-related stress and reduce the misuse of
firearms and extra-judicial killings. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the shift duty structure of
the Nigeria police is currently a 12-hour, two shifts system against
the eight hours three shift standard.
