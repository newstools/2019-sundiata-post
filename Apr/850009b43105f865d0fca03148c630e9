An Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Yomi Shogunle, on Wednesday, April 17, said that another way of avoiding being killed by Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) is not to speak Queens English to police officers. He said this in a tweet quoting Tunji Disu‚Äôs video where he was addressing members of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) in Lagos about the incessant killing of innocent civilians. This is coming at a time Nigerians are calling for an end to police brutality following killings of innocent Nigerian youths by trigger-happy officers.
