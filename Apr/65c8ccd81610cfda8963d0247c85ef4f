Multiple bomb blasts in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday. And these are what have happened since then: My Take: The President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, is a “bloody civilian”. Our own, according to his e-kids, is a former GOC (general officer commanding), former military governor, former garrison commander and former Commander-in-Chief and currently Commander-in-Chief. But what do we get? He told us to our face that he was not aware (yet again) that his Inspector-General of Police didn’t carry out his instructions. The dude kept his job until he retired. His security chiefs have blamed opposition, farmers, disgruntled politicians, traditional rulers, herdsmen and so on but no one has lost his job. There IS a country.
