A 26 year-old girl called Vivian has been rescued by a popular Lagos pastor from prostitution and addiction to hard drugs. In a video shared by the pastor, the girl said she was influenced by her ex boyfriend and when life took a downhill turn, she began to sustain her drug habit by begging on the streets and prostituting. She attended one of the best secondary schools in Lagos and came from a decent background before slipping into the world of drugs and prostitution.
