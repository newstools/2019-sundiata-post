ABUJA (Sundiata Post) –  Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has dismisses as “total fabrication” the latest allegation he said was instigated by the President Muhammadu Buhari campaign that he (Atiku) spent $30,000 to hire a US lobby group to persuade the US Congress to stop the inauguration of President Muhammadu Buhari. Reacting
to what he called “shameless lies”, Atiku’s Media Adviser, Mr. Paul
Ibe, in a statement sent to Sundiata Post, said the latest propaganda
against the former Vice President and presidential candidate of the main
opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) “didn’t come as a surprise to
us because lying has so far become their only bragging rights of
competence.” In
the statement issued in Abuja on Wednesday, Mr. Ibe explained that
“lying has become a culture to the APC administration and therefore, we
are not surprised by their latest diversionary allegations.” The
statement added that “since Atiku resisted pressure not to go to court,
the APC has been behaving like a cat on hot bricks because the outcome
of the 2019 elections has exposed and shattered the facade of their
dubious integrity.” According
to Ibe, “the APC are behaving nervously like a thief living under the
fear of being exposed and shamed”, and that “they are now using fake
news against Atiku instead of focusing on defending themselves in the
court. “For
a party that has broken the worst record in election rigging, the APC
doesn’t have any iota of integrity to be taken seriously by anybody”. According
to Ibe, “Atiku’s court case has become their biggest burden because it
exposes their integrity as a sham, and instead of defending their stolen
mandate in court, they are now using fake news to divert public
attention from the historic electoral heist they have committed against
Nigerians.” The
statement added that no amount of diversionary propaganda and fake news
campaign by APC will stop Atiku Abubakar from continuing the court
action he started to reclaim the stolen mandate.
