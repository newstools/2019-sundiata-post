By Veronica Dariya Bwari – A Dutse Grade I Area Court, Abuja on Thursday sentenced an ex-convict Usman Abdullahi, 22, to 12 months in prison for stealing three pumping machines valued at N150, 000. The Judge, Mr Suleiman Mohammed, tried and found Abdullahi guilty on
the three counts of criminal trespass, continuous nuisance and theft. Mohammed held that the prosecution had proved its case beyond
reasonable doubt and sentenced the convict to 12 months imprisonment. He, however, gave the convict an option to pay N40, 000 as fine. The judge also advised and warned the convict against repeating any
criminal act, while adding that a more stringent judgment would be
passed on the convict if he was found wanting again. Earlier, the prosecutor, Mr Collins Emerua told the court that the
convict, who’s a resident of Kpata along Kaduna road in Bwari, was
reported at the Bwari Police Station by one Hyda Abdullahi of Baran-goni
in Bwari, on March 23. According to Emerua, the convict, trespassed into the duty post of
the complainant who guards a structure inthe  same address and
dishonestly stole the three pumping machines valued at N150,000. The prosecution added that, during police investigation, the convict confessed to the crime. He also noted that the convict had in the past, committed a similar
offence, charged to court, convicted and was warned never to break the
law again but be of good character. Emerua, however said that it was obvious the convict has refused to change. He said that the act, contravened the provisions of  sections 348, 199 and 287 of the Penal Code.
