By Deborah Coker Benin, – The Scrabble Players Association has appealed to Government and Corporate  organisations in the country to assist the association through sponsorship. Mr Anthony Ikolo, National Coach of the Association made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Benin on Sunday, at the end of the association’s Three-day Third Phase selection series. Ikolo said that though the nation was doing very well in world competitions, the funding and sponsorship of the game had been a major challenge faced by the association. He appealed to government and corporate  organisations to give scrabble the kind of attention given to sports like football, basketball and athletics. He told NAN that the selection series was to select the country’s 11 best players who would represent the nation in the World English Scrabble Players Association Championship (WESPAC) billed for Oct. 15 to 20 in Goa, India. He explained that Nigeria in 2017 retained the championship it won in
2015 and came out as the first runner up in the individual category. Similarly, Mr Bright Idahosa, Coach of the Edo chapter, called on government to boost interest in the game among the populace. Idahosa said that the game was a mind sport and should be given its pride of place in the society. While commending the Edo Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, for his
efforts at repositioning sports in the state, he noted that the presence
of the national body in the state would help boost the chances of
players from the state to qualify for the competition.
He noted that it was quite challenging to host the series due to lack of
funds, but commended the Deputy Governor’s office for the assistance.
Both coaches, however, unanimously called on government to try to sponsor the team to the Oct 15-20 world tournament.
