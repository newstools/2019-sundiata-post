Geneva – Not fewer than 21 Venezuelans were missing after their boat sank on the way to the Caribbean island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, the UN refugee agency said on Friday. The UN cited information from that country’s coast guard. The boat, the “Jhonnaly Jose’’ was carrying at least 25 people from
the Venezuelan coastal town of Guiria when it capsised in the early
hours of Wednesday, UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch told a regular UN
briefing in Geneva. “This tragic incident highlights the extreme risks of sea journeys
and other irregular cross-border movements undertaken by refugees and
migrants. “It also underscores the desperation of those forced to flee their
homes and the extraordinary difficulties faced on their journey,’’ he
said. The UNHCR says over three million Venezuelans have fled the South
American country since 2014 due to widespread shortages of food and
medicine and deteriorating law and order. Four of the 25 aboard the boat were rescued by the Trinidad and
Tobago coast guard after a search and rescue effort carried out jointly
with Venezuelan counterparts, and then taken back to Venezuela, Baloch
said. Trinidad and Tobago is situated about 70 km (45 miles) off Venezuela’s Northern coast. Venezuela plunged into deeper political crisis in January when Juan
Guaido, head of the opposition-controlled congress, invoked the
constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing Nicolas Maduro’s
2018 re-election was not legitimate.
