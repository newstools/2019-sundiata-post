By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – With Nigerians not able to get
deserved dividend of democracy in the past three and half years due mainly to
the antagonism and toxic relationship between the 8th Assembly and
the executive, the people are optimistic that the 9th senate would
do things differently to ensure that such misfortune never repeated itself as
the 9th assembly is constituted come June 2019. These denials came in form of refusal to give the executive
demands accelerated passage or approval for good governance in one hand and not
assenting to bills that would have made life better for the citizenry on the
other hand. The ruling All Progressives Congress, despite being in the
majority in both red and green chambers were not able to organize itself well
to manage its successes after 2015 electon, as such, the favoured and anointed
members supported by the party were in a jamboree meeting at the International
Conference Centre (ICC) when the opposition People’s Democratic Party, (PDP) rallied
round the former governor of Kwara State and former PDP’s governors’ Forum
Chairman, Dr Bukola Saraki to emerge the Senate president. This alliance was viewed by the party hierarchy as unholy
alliance and that set the stage for the bad blood that exists between this 8th
senate and the executive. To political watchers, the APC has not learnt any
lessen from what played out during the leadership of the principal officers in
2015. The same scenario is about to repeat itself as the Comrade Adams
Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee is poised to flog its members into
line to impose leadership on the lawmakers. This he has shown by the way and
manner he instructed elected members of the party, to elect Senator Ahmed Lawan
as the senate president of the 9th Assembly. However, if the elected senators are allowed to collectively
elect their principal officers without external interference, it goes to show
that there would be seamless inter-relationship between the executive and the
legislatures and the Nigerians and indeed the APC-led administration would be
better for it. This will remove the tension and fear of impeachment that characterized
and determined who is appointed to what position or committee to ensure protection.
It will also give the lawmakers confidences that there are no
executive-favoured lawmakers who like in the outgoing 8th senate were seen as
moles within its folds. As Nigerians look forward to a vibrant 9th
Assembly, political analysts have called on the elected federal lawmakers to
shun partisanship and see themselves as lawmakers of the federal republic and
make laws that will offer genuine dividend of democracy to the people and also
provide good governance to  the people. See the full list of Senators-elect for the ninth senate as
