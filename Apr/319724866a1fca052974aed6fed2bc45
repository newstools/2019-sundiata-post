By Benson Ezugwu Calabar – The Cross River Government has directed its Cocoa Lease Allocation Committee to allocate the plots in the government’s cocoa estates to farmers.The Special Adviser to the Governor on Cocoa Development, Mr Oscar Ofuka, said on Friday in Calabar while addressing journalists on government’s plan for the new farming season.Ofuka said that following the expiration of the tenure of the last allocations made, fresh allocations would enable cocoa farmers to have sense of direction as well as secure the estates for rehabilitation.“Government is acting to the time frame within the cocoa farming season and in the overriding public interest.“The state government has directed the cocoa allocation committee to ensure strict compliance with its terms of reference to ensure that it meets the April 30 deadline,’’ he said.The special adviser said that the committee was also mandated to ensure that the host communities were given priority in the allocation.“The committee is also directed to ensure that 70 per cent of the allocation is given to the Landlord communities,’’ he said.Ofuka further said that all new allocations would take effect from this year and not 2020 as was being speculated in some quarters.He advised the new committee to be transparent and honest in its assignment and avoid the mistakes of the immediate past committee.The special adviser also stressed the need for cocoa farmers to cooperate with the committee in the overall interest of the state.
