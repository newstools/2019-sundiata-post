By Rob Wilson Compared with what other country? If it’s the US, then there are several reasons Canada is more expensive than its southern neighbour: • Canada’s higher taxes on everything from alcohol to cars helps to pay for a universal public healthcare system and a range of social welfare benefits. • Canada’s smaller population of 36 million does not offer the same economies of scale as the US, and higher consumer prices for many items reflect this. • Canada’s four season climate mean that during the winter, significant fresh produce must be imported from the US, Mexico or Latin America—at greater cost. • Because of Canada’s climate, all tropical fruit must be imported, at a higher cost. Everything from bananas to mangoes. • Canada’s supply-managed dairy system ensures fair returns for Canadian dairy farmers but also higher costs for milk and cheese than the USA. • Canada’s labour laws and unions ensure a higher minimum wage and the absence of workers earning $5 hour as in some US situations. So the added wage costs get passed on to consumers. • The vast expanse of Canada ensures high transport costs that are passed on to consumers. These are just some of the reasons costs in Canada are often higher than in the US and even some other countries. Source: Quora
