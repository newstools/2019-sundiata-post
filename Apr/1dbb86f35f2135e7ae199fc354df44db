President Muhammadu Buhari has donated $500,000 in support of the legislative election in Guinea Bissau. He also approved five Toyota Hilux, two trucks, 10 motorcycles and 350 units of electoral kits for Guinea Bissau. The Presidency said Buhari made the donations in response to an “urgent request” by Guinea Bissau to support the electoral process in the small West African country. “In his capacity as Chairman of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State, President Muhammadu Buhari, this morning (Friday) directed the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, to undertake an urgent mission as his Special Envoy to Guinea Bissau in company with the ECOWAS Commission President, Jean-Claude Brou. “President Buhari had in response to an urgent request for assistance by the government of Guinea Bissau graciously approved support for the country’s election process, including 350 units of electoral kits, 10 motorcycles, five (Toyota) Hilux, two light trucks and $500,000,” the Presidency said in a statement by Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu. The Presidency added that Onyeama was given another task to “undertake a mission to Cotonou, Benin Republic, to deliver a personal message to President Patrice Talon from President Buhari”. The statement added that this was in “the context of the brewing political crisis ahead of the April 28, 2019 legislative election in the country”. Punch
