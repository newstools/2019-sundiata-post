Lagos socialite, Pretty Mike in a long post on Instagram explained the importance of video vixens in the Entertainment industry. He stated that many ladies now venture into the business. But he also accused the directors of taking sexual advantage of them. “Due to the numbers of the vixens and the wish to all play lead roles, some of the music directors take advantage of them. “Top directors such as @Clarenceshotit @unlimitedla @Paul_Gambit over the years have been known to take advantage of these girls and they are also the top womanizers having the record of sleeping with the most vixens.” He wrote. In a response, Clarence Peters has posted some picture quotes on his Instagram status about envy and hate, a subliminal way of addressing Pretty Mike. See posts below:
