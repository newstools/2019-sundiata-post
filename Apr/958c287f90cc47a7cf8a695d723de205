By Sani Abdulrahman Kaduna – A Sharia Court I, sitting in Magajin Gari, Kaduna State on Monday confirmed that Mallam  Muhammad Jibril, was responsible for his ex-wife’s pregnancy. The Judge, Dahiru Lawal,  while delivering judgment, ordered Jubril
to take responsibility for the pregnancy and discharge his fatherly role
to the child when born. NAN reports that a 28-year-old divorcee, Bilkisu Aminu, dragged her ex-husband, Jibril,  for allegedly denying  her pregnancy. The case was mentioned on April 1, when the Judge ordered Aminu to go for a pregnancy test. The complainant, who resides on Benin Street, Kaduna, told the court
that she got married to the defendant for three months before they were
divorced. ‘He divorced me on Feb. 6, but after few days at home, I went to a
private hospital and the doctor confirmed that I was pregnant. ‘I called Jibril to inform him of the pregnancy. He told me that he will visit me but he never did,’ she said. Jibril, 32, who resides along Zaria Road in Kaduna told the court that he was not responsible for the pregnancy. He said he did not have sex with his divorced wife for two months during their three-month marriage. ‘We had series of misunderstanding within the few months of our
marriage. We did not have sex at all while in the third month of our
marriage,’ Jibril said.
