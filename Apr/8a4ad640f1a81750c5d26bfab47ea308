The Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) has convicted the suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Walter Onnoghen and has banned him from holding any public office for the next 10 years. He was convicted on a six-count charge of false declaration of assets. Chairman of the CCT, Danladi Umar, while delivering the judgment on Thursday, read that Onnoghen will be removed from office as the Chief Justice of Nigeria and the Chairman of the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB). Mr. Danladi held that the Federal Government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the suspended Chief justice breached the Code of Conduct for public officers. The CCT also directed that all monies in the account which he failed to declare between 2009 and 2015 will be seized and fortified to the Federal Government based on the fact that he failed to show the tribunal how he acquired the monies in that account.
