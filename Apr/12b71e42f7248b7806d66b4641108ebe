ADDIS ABABA â€“ Ethiopian inflation rose to 11.2 percent in the year to March, the statistics bureau said on Saturday. Year-on-year inflation was 10.9 percent in February. The rise was mainly due to an increase in the price of cereals in the food basket, and non-food items such as house rent, fuel such as charcoal and wood, and transport, the bureau said. (Reuters)
