Allah will send her to hellfire for that unguarded comment.” The Police Public Relations, in the state, Mohammad Abubakar, said the suspect was arrested based on a tip-off, adding that he had confessed to the crime Abubakar said the injury Danjuna inflicted on the neck of deceased led to her death adding that the suspect will still be charged to court. •Sourced from The Nation report
