As soon as he left them, he was attacked by these men who asked him clearly his motive behind giving them money. #SmallDoctor escapes being lynched after a beggar accused him of stealing his penis (swipe) A post shared by  MORE JUICY NEWS B4 D LAST POST (@famousblogng) on Apr 7, 2019 at 10:02am PDT Baffled by the question, Small Doctor stared them in the face with a puzzled look.
