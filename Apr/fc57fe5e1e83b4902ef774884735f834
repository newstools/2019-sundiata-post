By Lucy Osuizigbo Lagos – A Political Analyst, Mr Wale Ogunade, on Sunday said that loyal party members should be considered for appointments into the National Assembly leadership and other committees. Ogunade, also the President, Voters Awareness Initiative, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. According to him, appointing members based on their loyalty to the 
party is one of the ways the 9th Assembly can perform better than the
previous ones.
“What is going on at the National Assembly is a very bad
precedence set by Sen. Bukola Saraki in 2015 and I hope the wise ones
among the legislators will not follow such example.
