Abuja (Sundiata Post) – President Muhammadu Buhari has extended the tenure of the Acting Chief judge, Justice Muhammad Tanko by 3 months. Sundiata Post recalls that Tanko’s tenure was to expire on April 25, 2019. According to a statement signed by the spokesperson for the NJC, Soji Oye, Buhari sent a recommendation to the National Judicial Council and the supervisory body approved the appointment on Thursday, Recall that Justice Muhammad was first appointed in January after the president in a controversial circumstance, suspended Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen. Tanko was criticized by legal practitioners for accepting his appointment given the fact that the NJC’s role was underplayed in the then Chief Justice’s suspension. Sundiata Post recalls that Onnoghen was convicted on Thursday by the Code of Conduct Tribunal, and was barred from holding public office for 10 years. Hoeever, Onnoghen has denied all allegations against him, and has headed to Appeal Court. A statement by presidential aide Garba Shehu on Thursday, following Mr Onnoghen’s conviction, had referred to him as “former” CJN giving rise to suspicions that the acting CJN would be confirmed. However, a statement released on Saturday by the NJC denies speculations that the council would meet next week to deliberate on the extension of Mr Muhammad’s term as the acting chief justice of Nigeria. Saying the approval had already been given. “Contrary to the above, the Council actually met on Thursday 18th April, 2019 and at the 88th Meeting considered and approved the request of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for the extension of the Appointment of Hon. Dr. Justice I. T. Muhammad, CFR, as the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria for another three (3) months and Council has since forwarded its approval to the President. It is not specific as to when the president sent the request.
