By Saidu Adamu Jalingo – Mariestopes International Nigeria, an NGO working on contraceptives and family planning, on Tuesday, donated clinical equipment worth millions of naira to 50 health facilities in 14 local  government areas of Taraba. The Clinical Training Officer of the group, Mrs Modupe Dimka, presented the equipment during a short ceremony at Taraba State Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Jalingo. Dimka said “Mariestopes is in Taraba to donate equipment, mainly Autoclaves, to prevent infection in rendering family planning  services to communities. “The equipment will help those rendering the services to sterilise and clean the instruments before using  them on women seeking family planning services.” She added that the level of response to services being  rendered  across the 14 local government areas of the state where the group was presently working was improving daily. She said “we want to encourage families to have children by choice and not by chance so as to improve the overall  development of communities. “Controlling births would impact positively on the overall economy and improve the wellbeing of women.” The Executive Secretary of Taraba Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Alhaji Aminu Hassan, thanked the group for the donation. He assured the NGO of the state government’s commitment to providing an enabling environment to operate. He called on other NGOs working  in  various  healthcare services to partner with the state government to improve the wellbeing of the people. Mariestopes International Nigeria had earlier trained various categories of health workers, traditional and religious leaders in the state to acquaint them with knowledge and commodities involved in family planning  process. The training was done to provide choices for families seeking advice in family planning.
