By Mercy Osajiugo Minna – An official of the Niger State College of Education, Minna, Hajia Hadiza Kolo has warned parents against aiding and abetting examinations malpractices for their children and wards. Kolo, the Academic Secretary of the College, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna on Saturday that such act had negative consequences on students’ performances. The academic secretary noted that it was responsible for the no fewer than 500 students expelled by the college in the 2017/2018 session for academic incompetence. She advised parents to allow their children and wards to work hard academically to discover themselves rather than seeking soft ground for them to their own detriment. “It is meaningless for students to brandish results they cannot defend; there is nobody who has genuinely passed school certificate examinations that will be expelled on academic grounds, ” she said. Kolo however, called on prospective students to shun cutting corners to pass school certificate examinations saying that if they genuinely pass the qualifying examination, they would not have academic hitches that would lead to their expulsion. “It is better to persevere to pass an examination in secondary level rather than manipulating fake pass that will later land such students into expulsion as a result of incompetence,” she said. Kolo described it as `absurd’ that many students who passed the qualifying examinations into the school with flying colours were still not able to pass the semester examinations. “It is a serious challenge for the education sector that needed to be tackled,” the secretary said.
