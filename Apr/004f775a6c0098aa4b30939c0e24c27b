Thieves burgled Kamorwon AP Post in Nandi County, North Rift of Kenya, on Tuesday night and made away with three rifles and ammunition. All the officers on duty had left the post and went to enjoy a UEFA Champions League match at a nearby trading centre. On returning to the post, they discovered that the room of the officer-in-charge, which also serves as an armory, was open. They walked in to find the steel box, in which firearms are kept, broken. The thieves stole three rifles, with magazines of 20 rounds of ammunition each. They left behind only two magazines with 17 and 20 rounds. The scene was visited by the Nandi South OCPD, OCS and AP Commander. Search and investigations are underway to recover the stolen firearms and nab the suspects. Standard Media.
