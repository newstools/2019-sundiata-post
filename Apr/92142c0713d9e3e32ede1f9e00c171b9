Ex-Nigerian international footballer, Osaze Odemwingie, has announced his retirement from football at the Wembley Stadium in London. The 37-year-old made the decision public at the UEFA’s Equal Game conference held at Wembley on Wednesday. Speaking to Sky Sports after the announcement, he said: “It’s an emotional day, so many memories go through your head. I didn’t know how to do it or where to do it, but I think this is the right place to do it. Wembley is a place with a lot of history in football.” Osaze Odemwingie earned 63 caps for Nigeria, scoring 10 goals and was a part of Nigeria’s squad at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. The former West Brom and Stoke striker scored 36 goals in 129 Premier League appearances between 2010 and 2016. He also added that he was hoping to move into coaching now that his playing career had ended. Odemwingie made his last professional appearance for Indonesian side, Madura United, in 2017.
