Cairo – Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday discussed a number of regional issues including Libya and Sudan on a phone call. Sisi shed light on the unity and stability of Libya as well as Egypt’s support for efforts aiming at combating terror groups and extremist militias which pose threats not only for Libya, but the stability and security of the entire Middle East and European countries, Egyptian Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady said in a statement. Sisi also asserted that Egypt is closely following up developments in Sudan, pointing out that his country backs the choices of the Sudanese people. For her part, Merkel expressed her country’s keenness on reaching a political solution to the Libyan crisis as part of a dialogue among the Libyan parties and stressed the importance of stepping up efforts to end the deterioration of conditions in the Arab country. Since early April, the eastern-based Libyan army led by Khalifa Haftar, has been leading a military campaign to take over the capital Tripoli where the UN-backed government is based. Libya has been struggling to make a democratic transition amid insecurity and chaos since the fall of former leader Muammar Gaddafi’s regime in 2011. (Xinhua/NAN)
