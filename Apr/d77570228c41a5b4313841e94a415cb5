Church, Nkwelle Ezunaka, during a thanksgiving mass for the family of
Prof. Greg Nwakoby, Vice Chancellor of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu
University, Awka. Obiano said the suspected killers would be paraded by the police soon. Similarly, he disclosed that kidnappers of a banker at Otuocha in Anambra East Council have also been apprehended. The governor urged Anambra residents to go about their lawful
