Actor Guild of Nigeria president, Emeka Rollas, confirmed his death in a Nollywood WhatsApp group called Film4Life. Onyeabor is best remembered for his critically acclaimed ghetto movie, New Jerusalem, which earned him several nominations and a win at the Africa Movie Academy Award (AMAA). He also made news when he was locked in a battle over co-production disagreements with Steve James. He was charged to court and remanded in prison but was later released after he settled out of court with his business partner. Speaking later about the incident, James said “I blame the problem on breakdown of communication between us. I was new in the industry and naturally reacted the way someone would react when third parties come to say you’re about to lose your investment. “Luckily after everything, I discovered that Ifeanyi, actually meant well, and his lawyer and my lawyer sat down and agreed to withdraw the matter from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
