A
call has gone to Imo people in Diaspora to “play an active role in the
governance of their state, instead of distancing themselves from the
happenings at home”. The
Imo State Governor-elect, Chief Emeka Ihedioha, who made the call at
the weekend, while addressing Imo people in the United Kingdom, also
urged them to get prepared to play more active and challenging roles in
the incoming administration. According
to reports monitored in Owerri, Chief Ihedioha also encouraged them to
take what he called “committed interest and full participation in the
running of Imo State. “I
assure you that I will begin to tackle the huge problems facing the
state, which have sadly inflicted equally massive suffering on the
hapless masses,” Chief Ihedioha said. While
restating his campaign promise of running an inclusive government that
would accommodate every Imolite in the Rebuild Imo Project, Ihedioha
also disclosed that his administration will religiously respect the rule
of law. “To
enhance the task of rebuilding the state, my administration will
restore respect for the rule of law and due process through
re-establishing the sanctity of the separation of powers among the three
tiers of government”, Ihedioha said. The
governor-elect, who expressed regret over the comatose situation of the
27 local council areas of the state in the past eight years, however,
promised to ensure the full autonomy of the local government
administration in the state. Ihedioha
was hosted by a group, Imo State Union in the United Kingdom at Dukes
Aldridge Academy, Turlock Road, Tottenham, London. One of the highlights
of the event was the award of legislative excellence for Ihedioha’s
outstanding achievements as a national legislator par excellence.
