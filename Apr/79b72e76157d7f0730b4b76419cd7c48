An Imam has called out popular cross crossdresser for giving them a fake N500k cheque. The Imam had hailed the ‘drama queen’ for pledging the above amount to them to build a mosque — During Liz Anjorin’s coronation party. The Imam has now called out the cross-dresser for not only giving them a fake cheque but for sleeping with men for money. The Muslim cleric also alleged that he knows some gay partners of Bobrisky. A few months who, Nollywood actress, Liz Anjorin revealed that she had been awarded Borokinni Adinni of Nigeria by the Islamic Foundation of Nigeria and threw a party to the effect. The actress also thanked Bobrisky for being part of those who attended her coronation ceremony — While she revealed how some attendees of the event weren’t so pleased that the cross dresser attended but that quickly changes when Bobrisky started sharing bags of beverages. Anjorin, however said that except it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that Bobrisky in fact sleeps with men, she would never ever dissociate herself from him.(Informationng)
