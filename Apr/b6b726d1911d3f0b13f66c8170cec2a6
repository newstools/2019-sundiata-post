Kcee has motivated, inspired a lot of people and at the same time oppressed many others after he flaunted the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars (fifty four million naira) cash in his car. The singer recently uploaded a video on his Instagram page in which he is seen arranging wands of cash of dollars in his car. The singer just released an high-life saturated album titled “Eastern Conference.” Kcee is really enjoying life and this could probably be down to the efforts of his younger brother; E-Money; a young billionaire and business mogul.
