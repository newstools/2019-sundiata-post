By Blessing Ibegbu Mararaba – A Mararaba Upper Area Court, Nasarawa State, on Friday dissolved the 16-year -old marriage between Samson Apaila,  and his wife, Grace, for infidelity and troublesome behaviour. The judge, Ibrahim Shakarau, dissolved the marriage in the interest
of peace, saying that the parties have ceased to be husband and wife
henceforth. “The parties are to maintain peace all the time, any violation of the
order of this court will amount to contempt and of course with grave
consequences. “Also the parties should collect their divorce certificate from the registrar’s office,’’ he ordered. Shakarau granted the petition custody of the three children produced by the 16-year-old marriage. Apaila had told the court that he was married to the respondent since
2003, according to the native law and customs of Igala people, while
 the union produced three children. “She is a very troublesome woman. She quarrels, nags and fights me at every slight provocation or without reason. “She is an unfaithful wife, as she cannot stay at home and look after
the children, but goes out with other men and even threatens to kill me
whenever I raise the matter. “Please, let this honourable court separate us, there is no longer
love in the union and nothing can bring us together again,” Apaila told
the court. The petitioner also pleaded with the court to grant him the custody
of two of the three children, while the last one, who is about  five
years old remain with the respondent, while he still takes
responsibility. The respondent who was in court, did not object to the separation,
but asked the court to grant the petitioner’s request and to also grant
him custody of the third child as well.
