Awka – The All Progressives Congress (APC), has urged the Anambra Election Petitions Tribunal, sitting in Awka to nullify the election of Mr Chukwuka Ezenwune of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) as winner of Idemili South constituency. Ezenwune was declared winner of the March 9 state assembly election for Idemili South constituency by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). But Mr Bona Orakwe, of the APC in his  petition, marked
EPT/AN/SHA/35/2019, contended that the APGA candidate did not score the
highest number of lawful votes. Joined as respondents are APGA, INEC,  Resident Electoral
Commissioner (REC) and Returning Officer for the local government area. The petitioner contended that the APGA candidate did not score lawful
majority votes cast in the election and therefore should not have been
returned as winner. Ezenwune scored 10, 710 votes, ahead of the second placed Mr Frank
Okigbo of People Democratic Party who scored 4,071, while Orakwe
garnered 3,210 votes to come third in the contest. Orakwe said the election was marred with irregularities and
substantial non-compliance to the Electoral Act, which affected the
result declared by INEC. He contended that he scored the highest number of lawful votes cast
and should be declared the winners or in the alternative nullify the
election held on March 9 and order for fresh poll.
