By Benson Ezugwu Calabar – The Pan African Good Governance Council (PAGGC), a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), has presented an award of `Excellence’ to the Executive Chairman, Cross River State Universal Basic Education Board (CRSUBEB), Dr Stephen Odey. Odey received the award on Tuesday in Calabar when a delegation from PAGGC led by Prof. Austin Angba visited him in his office. Angba said that the award was in recognition of Odey’s excellent
performance in service delivery, especially in the basic education
sub-sector in Cross River. He said: “This award is in recognition of your outstanding
achievements and commitment to the advancement of good governance,
especially in the basic education sector in Cross River, Nigeria and
Africa.’’ He said the visit and award was part of the council’s annual Good
Governance Indicators Programme, saying that the SUBEB chairman had also
been appointed as PAGGC’s “Good Governance Ambassador’’, Angba noted that the council was established in 2010 as a watchdog to
promote, enforce and encourage good governance among African states. “We also celebrate and honour individuals who have made immeasurable
impact in their roles in governance and leadership,’’ he said. Responding, Odey expressed gratitude to the council for the honour, describing it as a humbling experience. He said that the gesture would spur him to greater heights. He, however, attributed his achievements in the basic education
sector to the commitment of Gov. Ben Ayade toward ensuring that Cross
River becomes a leading state in basic education in the country. Odey said the board had been able to address key challenges confronting the basic education sector in the state. “We have to leave a legacy. By the time we leave here, people should have positive stories to tell. “We may not be perfect but we have been able to address some key
issues that had bedeviled the basic education subsector in Cross River
State, ‘’ he said.
