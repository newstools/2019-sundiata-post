Liberian President, George Weah has vacated his office after two black snakes were spotted around it. According to Eyewitnessreporters through his secretary, Mr Smith Toby who explained that two black snakes were found in the foreign affairs ministry building, Weah’s official place of work. In view of this, therefore, all staff have been told to stay away until 22 April. Toby said, “It’s just to make sure that crawling and creeping things get fumigated from the building. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosts the office of the president, so it did an internal memo asking the staff to stay home while they do the fumigation. “The snakes were never killed, there was a little hole somewhere through which they made their way back.” Source: Eyewitnessreporters
