Ankara – Czech soccer player, Josef Sural who plays for Turkey’s Aytemiz Alanyaspor, was killed after a minibus carrying players from the club, crashed while returning from an away match, the club said on Monday. Sural, Czech international and Alanyaspor striker, died at the
hospital where he and six of his teammates were taken after the crash,
the club said on Twitter. Seven Alanyaspor players had rented a VIP minibus to return from the
club’s 1-1 draw against Kayserispor on Sunday and the bus crashed some 5
km from the southern coastal town of Alanya, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu
news agency said. The rest of the club’s players and staff had either returned with the team’s bus or on their own, Anadolu said. It said that the driver of the VIP bus had been detained following the accident and an investigation had been launched. Club Chairman,  Hasan Cavusoglu, was quoted as saying that the driver
had fallen asleep behind the wheel of the minibus while a second driver
was also asleep at the time. “According to information I received from our police chief, despite
there being two drivers on the vehicle, they were both asleep. “The crash happened as a result of them both being asleep,” Anadolu quoted Cavusoglu as saying. He said the other six players injured in the crash were not in critical condition.
