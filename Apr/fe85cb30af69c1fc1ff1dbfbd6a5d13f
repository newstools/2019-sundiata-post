By Bukola Adetoye Lagos – The Nigerian Insurer’s Association (NIA) on Monday commiserated with families of the victims of Saturday’s petrol tanker explosion in Gombe and prayed against a reoccurrence. The Chairman of NIA, Mr Tope Smart expressed the empathy in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. NAN reports that at least 10 people were killed and several cars
burnt, after a petroleum tanker exploded at Bomala Bridge axis of the
Gombe state capital on Saturday afternoon. According to an eyewitness account of the incident, the petrol-laden
tanker collided with a truck carrying bottled water on the Gombe
southern bypass. Smart, therefore, implored commuters to drive with care and observe
traffic rules always to guard against unnecessary loss of lives. He said,”Besides being underwriters, we empathise with the families that lost their loved ones in the explosion.” He urged Nigerians to insure against unexpected occurrences, saying
that doing so would ease their financial burden in times of emergencies.
