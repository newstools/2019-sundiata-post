Egbon Kayode, Now that you have scaled TWO major legal hurdles in ONE week, now is the time for you to settle down and work for the benefit of Ekiti State. And not the elitist approach of 2010 to 2014 please! Last week, Court of Appeal dismissed Prof. Eleka’s objection to the lower tribunal that upheld your election. Today, Supreme Court dismissed the objection raised by former Governor Segun Oni to your nomination as the APC candidate. While I personally have objection to your MANNER of emergence, it is instructive that this has been put to rest once and for all. Perhaps, Providence had its reasons. Gomina Fayemi, Ekiti deserves your all: security and ethical reorientation, especially re-orientating our young generation that there is life outside politics. Not just creating jobs for “political boys”! All the best…
