Nollywood actress, Rita Edochie, has said she did not celebrate her
birthday yesterday in solidarity with Peoples Democratic Party, PDP,
presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. She, however, called for prayers in order for Atiku to reclaim his allegedly stolen mandate in court. According to the veteran actress, after many years of Independence,
Nigerians deserve better than what they are getting from the current
administration. She wrote on her Instagram page yesterday: “TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY but i
am not celebrating it, JUST MARKING it because NOTHING to CELEBRATE
for. “I feel that after so many years of independence, NIGERIA deserves
better. EVERY RIGHT THINKING NIGERIAN should be WORRIED about what we
are PASSING THROUGH today. “The last general elections were the worst ever in the history of
this country, INEC had enough time and resources to give Nigerians a
free and fair elections but what HAPPENED? “The most CONTROVERSIAL is the PRESIDENTIAL election which is now generating enough HEAT. “The only birthday gift I need from my numerous fans across the globe
is prayer so that now that President Buhari and Atiku Abubakar at
headed for the tribunals, let the truth be told so that there will be
peace and harmony in the country. “Therefore, I DEDICATE my BIRTHDAY to my BOSS, ATIKU ABUBAKAR, for the truth to be told so that he will RECLAIM his MANDATE.”(Dailypost)
