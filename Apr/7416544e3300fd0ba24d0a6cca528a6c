Abuja – The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) said  it has received the approval of the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to begin installation of meters, under the Meter Asset Provider(MAP) policy. NAN reports that the policy was designed to address the metering gap
within its franchise areas of  FCT,  Kogi, Niger and  Nasarawa States. AEDC’s General Manager, Corporate Communications,Mr Oyebode Fadipe,
in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, said the  commencement of the field
operations of MAP, initiated  by NERC was a huge and visible effort on
the part of the regulator to address the metering gap in the sector. ” For us in AEDC, the MAP policy speaks to our overall transformation agenda for greater service delivery to our customers. ” The metering programme will not only engender billing integrity and
 improve our revenue base, it will also cut down sharply the issue of
estimated billing, which has remained a source of concern to our
customers.” He said AEDC was  currently working with the NERC approved  MAP  to
perfect necessary logistics associated with the commencement of the
field work. NAN reports that NERC in a statement  on Saturday announced that that the installation of meters under MAP would begin on May 1. The commission had said that Abuja and Jos DisCos had completed the
procurement process of MAP and would begin the installation of meters
with their meter Providers.
