By Ige Adekunle Sango-Ota – The Ogun Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said on Friday that the implementation of the Penalty Point System on traffic offenders would drastically reduce road accidents nationwide. Mr Clement Oladele, the Ogun Sector Commander of FRSC, disclosed this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota, Ogun. The full implementation of the penalty point system is expected to begin on June 1. According to the sector commander, the implementation of the system is with a view to checking the excesses of drivers and make them adhere to the traffic law. The traffic law deals with issues relating to driving licences, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, hazardous motor vehicle activities, and motorcycle regulation. Other issues are parking law, pedestrian crossings, road speed limit, rules of the road, and vehicle law. The sector commander further said that the implementation of the system was with a view to changing the negative habits of motorists and attitudes to stem cases of road crashes. He said that with the system in place, road users who violated traffic regulations for a stipulated number of times would be sent back to driving school for retraining depending on the gravity of the offences. “If the offenders have between one and ten points, the FRSC will ask the offender to pay a certain amount of money as fine. “But anyone whose offences go beyond 15 point, their driving licences would be revoked by FRSC,” he said. Oladele further explained that offenders with accumulated 21 points and above penalty points would have their driving licences withdrawn.
