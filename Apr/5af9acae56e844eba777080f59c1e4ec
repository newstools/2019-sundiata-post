Yahoo Yahoo and other sibling crimes are not a consequence of unemployment, poverty or lack. They are a consequence of greed and an erosion of social values. It still plays in my head the thought of five young men who left Nigeria for a robbery in Dubai. This madness needs serious clinical study. The average flight ticket from Lagos to Dubai is about 200k. These boys had about N1 million for air transportation. When you add other sundry costs, the money will even be much more than that. Why didn’t they investment in a business? Obviously, they were not poor, but simply greedy. Every day, I read reports from the EFCC of arrest of Yahoo boys. Every day. A young man, who has work tools – data, a laptop and other gadgets – but chooses to apply them to internet scam is not driven by unemployment, but by greed, decadence and lack of values.
