persons injured. In March, 20 crashes occurred, five persons lost their

violating traffic rules and regulations, adding that necessary sanctions
were meted on them based on the offences. He called on motorists, particularly commercials drivers, to obey
traffic rules and regulations and to cooperate with FRSC towards making
the highways safer for all.
