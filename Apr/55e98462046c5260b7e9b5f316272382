By Brian Bi People only think that Canada’s immigration rate is high because they don’t think that other countries’ immigration rates are low. The vast majority of countries in the world are very culturally and ethnically homogeneous. Their populations by and large do not welcome immigration. They value their homogeneity and fear that immigration will erode their culture. Canada is a very multicultural country and Canadians are much less xenophobic than most other nations in the world. As a Canadian, I feel that this is the sensible default, that we’re doing the right thing, and that other countries are being weird. We know from experience that when we welcome immigrants with open arms, they in turn embrace Canadian culture and enrich it through the admixture of their own native culture. Their children grow up truly Canadian, just as much as anyone else born in Canada. What historical factors led to the current situation? As far as I know, Canada has simply had a high immigration rate since its inception. The graph found here shows the number of immigrants Canada accepted from 1860 to 2014 as a fraction of the total population. I reproduce the graph here: From this graph we can easily see that for most of Canada’s history as a nation, the annual immigration rate has been over 0.5%. (A very noticeable downturn occurred during the Great Depression.) So I cannot point to any particular event that led to Canada being a country that accepts a lot of immigrants. Personally, I think Canada needs even more immigrants. The majority of the highly intelligent and accomplished Canadians I know are foreign-born, and as long as Canada’s population remains low, so will Canada’s economic power. Source: Quora
