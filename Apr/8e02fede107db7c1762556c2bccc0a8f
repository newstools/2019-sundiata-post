Cairo – Egypt expressed its full support for the choice of the Sudanese people and their free will to determine the future of Sudan, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. Egypt also urged the international community to support the choice of the Sudanese people and what they will agree on “in this decisive historical stage.’’ The statement came hours after the Sudanese army announced the ouster and detention of long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir in response to mass protests that lasted for about four months against his three-decade rule. The ministry said that Egypt’s position is based on the country’s fixed principle of “full respect for Sudan’s sovereignty and its national decision.’’ “Egypt follows up closely and attentively the ongoing rapid developments that Sudan is going through at this decisive moment in its modern history,’’ the statement said. It also called on all friendly states to support Sudan “to achieve peaceful transition toward a better future.’’ (Xinhua/NAN)
