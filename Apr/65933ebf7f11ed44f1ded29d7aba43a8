The three years old marriage of Popular actor, Mofe Duncan wife, Jessica has crashed, due to irreconcilable differences. This was confirmed by Jessica after an unidentified person asked on social media if she plans on getting married again when the right man comes. Jessica replied saying “not anymore”. Mofe Duncan and Jessica got married in August 2015 and had an issue in 2016 when a leaked chat showed the actor flirting with a lady identified as Zainab. The couple brushed past the episode and got stronger as seen by a message shared by Jessica when they celebrated their 1st wedding anniversary. She wrote: “One year has passed so quickly and I don’t even know how. Over the last I have realized that marriage is not just about love, hugs cuddles but it is also about fights and arguments. But even fighting and arguing with a sweet husband like you, feels like a cute thing to do. With the rate at which we’re making priceless memories, we’ll need at least a couple of more lifetimes to let them soak in. Happy 1st anniversary.” We can only hope they can get back together again.
