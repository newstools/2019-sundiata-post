By Remi Bamgbose Okitipupa – The Ondo State Police Command, has vowed to arrest the fleeing suspect, who killed eight members of a family of nine by setting their home on fire on Tuesday in Okitipupa Local Government Area. SP Femi Joseph, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO),
gave this assurance in a telephone interview with the News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday. Joseph, who described the incident as unfortunate, commiserated with the family of the deceased. “I do not know what was on the mind of the suspect to have set ablaze the family members, this is very unfortunate. “Although, the suspect is on the run, we are
seriously on a manhunt for him for committing this dastardly act and we
will bring him to justice,” he said. NAN reports that the residents of Igbodigo in Ayeka, Okitipupa, woke
up on Tuesday morning to the horrible sight of nine family members
severely burnt by fire. The arsonist, believed to be a jilted suitor of a female member of
the family, was reported to have at around 2 a.m. while the family
members were asleep, poured petrol around their apartment and set it on
fire. NAN reports that one of the nine victims was rescued with severe burns and rushed to a hospital in Okitipupa. The victim was later transferred to the state specialist hospital in
Okitipupa, where doctors have been battling to save his life. All efforts made by NAN to speak with Dr Olumide Akadiri, the Chief
Medical Director of the hospital on the matter proved futile, as he
could not be contacted as at the time of filing in this report.
