ABUJA (Sundiata Post) –  Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has sent a
congratulatory message to Governor Nyesom Wike on his victory in the
March 9 governorship election in Rivers State. In
the message sent to Sundiata Post on Wednesday, AMy hearty
congratulations to Governor Nyesom Wike on your hard earned re-election.
It gives me much pleasure to see a political force for good, such as
yourself, overcome the anti-democratic forces of dictatorship and
oppression.  The Peoples Democratic Party is blessed to
have a political gladiator, such as yourself, on our side. The citizens
of Rivers state are fortunate to have a genuine progressive return to
extend the frontiers of progress and development for them.  And I am favoured to count you, Governor Wike, as my friend and brother, and Rivers state as my second home.  As
your victory is savoured by men of goodwill all over Nigeria, I am sure
you will continue the pattern of good works for which you have become
known.  Nigeria needs men like you. Men who can remain
firm, unbowed and resolute in the face of trying times. You have proved
that you have character under trial, and not just when the going is
good. Such refinement will stand you in good stead as, by the grace of
God, you finish the good work you have started in Rivers state.  Congratulations once again and may God bless Rivers state and her people and may God bless Nigeria and Nigerians.  Atiku Abubakar Waziri of Adamawa 3 April, 2019
