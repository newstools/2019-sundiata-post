Brussels – The European Union’s bid to overhaul its two-decade old copyright rules cleared its final hurdle on Monday as EU governments backed the move forcing Google to pay publishers for news snippets and Facebook to filter out protected content. Nineteen countries, including France and Germany, endorsed the revamp
while Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden
were against. Belgium, Estonia and Slovenia abstained. The European Parliament gave its green light last month to a proposal
that has pitted Europe’s creative industry against tech companies,
internet activists and consumer groups, triggering intense lobbying from
both sides. The European Commission kicked off the debate two years ago, saying
the rules needed to be revised to protect the bloc’s creative industries
which is worth 915 billion euros and employs 11.65 million people. Under the new rules, Google and other online platforms will have to
sign licensing agreements with musicians, performers, authors, news
publishers and journalists to use their work online. Google’s YouTube, Facebook’s Instagram and other sharing platforms
will also have to install filters to prevent users from uploading
copyrighted materials.
