London – President Donald Trump has accepted Queen Elizabeth’s invitation to make a state visit to Britain in June, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday. Trump and his wife Melania will make the trip from June 3 to June 5,
the palace said, adding that further details would be announced in due
course. Trump will hold a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May in
Downing Street and the trip also coincides with events to mark the 75th
anniversary of the D-Day landings during World War Two. “The UK and U.S. have a deep and enduring partnership that is rooted
in our common history and shared interests,” May said in a statement. “The State Visit is an opportunity to strengthen our already close
relationship in areas such as trade, investment, security and defense,
and to discuss how we can build on these ties in the years ahead.” The Trumps met the queen for tea at Windsor Castle on their last trip to Britain in July, which was not deemed a state visit. Similarly, Trump and his wife will travel to France on June 6, where
Trump will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron, the White House
said in a statement on Tuesday.
