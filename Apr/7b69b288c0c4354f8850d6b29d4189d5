By Victor Adeoti Osogbo – The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun has described the Federal High Court judgment nullifying  the candidacy of Sen. Ademola Adeleke as the flag bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the September 2018 gubernatorial elections as a victory for the state. The party in a statement issued on Wednesday in Osogbo  by its
Director of Publicity, Research and Strategy, Kunle Oyatomi,  said that
Osun deserved  a better personality  as governor. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a High Court of the
Federal Capital Territory had  nullified the candidacy of Adeleke as the
flag bearer of the PDP  in the September 2018 gubernatorial election. The court, presided over by Justice Othman Musa, made the decision
after it ruled that Adeleke failed to prove in court that he graduated
from a secondary school as required by Section 177 of the Nigerian
constitution. Adeleke had contested the election against other candidates, including APC’s  Adegboyega Oyetola. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Oyetola
winner after a rerun election was conducted in the state on Sept. 27. The  statement said the state had produced intellectual giants and
exceptionally brilliant businessmen and technocrats, including jurists
of international standard. It said the state “ was  too civilised to have a Ademola Adeleke as
governor, adding that “fortunately for Osun, we can depend on Nigerian’s
jurisprudence to uphold justice at the most critical point.’’ “We hope that the Appeal Court handling Osun governorship dispute
will take judicial notice of this judgment that has practically
disqualified Ademola Adeleke from the governorship position,”the
statement said. (NAN)
