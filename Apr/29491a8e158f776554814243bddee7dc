concerning the environment. He said that by being sensitive to environmental challenges, Nigeria
would be able to reduce the effect of Climate Change on the people. “Global environmental issue such as climate change is real, we must make effort to reduce its effect on the country. “The current heatwave nationwide has never been so, this should be
taken seriously and actions taken to mitigate the situation,” he said. Odigha said that Nigerians should be made to understand the issues of deforestation and desertification. “Nigerians should be made to support and encourage activities that will protect the environment. “People should engage in trees planting within and around their
houses and neighborhoods, they must stop cutting down trees without
appropriate permission,” he said. According to Odigha, environmental agencies and government
departments should be proactive in attending to the issues that degrade
the environment. “A new dispensation is due from May 29, as a coalition, we will want
