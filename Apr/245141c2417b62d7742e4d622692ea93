By Adaeze Iroha Lagos – The police on Wednesday arraigned a 34-year old mechanic, Sunny Ejuwa, in a Yaba Chief Magistrates’court for allegedly defrauding a clergyman of N150,000. Ejuwa, a resident of Apapa area of Lagos, is charged with four counts
of obtaining by false pretext, stealing and willful damage of property. The Prosecution Counsel, Sgt. Modupe Olaluwoye, told the court that
the defendant committed the offence on Jan. 7, at No. 2, ECWA str.,
Shomolu, Lagos. She alleged that the defendant had collected N150,000 from one pastor
Vitalis Onah, to repair the engine of his Mercedes Benz ML, with
registration No. AGL 433 FN. Olaluwoye told the court that the defendant instead, damaged the car engine and stole the gear-valve and car battery. She told the court that the defendant damaged, parked the car in his workshop and ran away.

15 years imprisonment for the offence of obtaining money under false
pretext while that of stealing prescribes a three-year jail term for
offenders, if convicted. Chief Magistrate, Mrs Oluwatoyin Oghere, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. Oghere ordered that the sureties should be gainfully employed and
must show evidence of three years’ tax payment to the Lagos State
