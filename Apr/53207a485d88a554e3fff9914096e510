By Kadiri Abdulrahman  Abuja, – The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has warned healthcare providers to stop using some automatic ventilators because of the danger they pose to human health. Prof. Moji Adeyeye, the agency’s Director-General, who gave the
warning in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, noted that such ventilators
had been recalled by the manufacturers. “NAFDAC has been informed of the voluntary recall of Two e700, e600
and e500 Automatic Transport Ventilators by O-Two Medical Technologies
Inc. “These ventilators are being recalled because of the dangers they pose. “An improperly inserted screw in the ventilator screen may wear
through the electrical insulation and create a short circuit that could
lead the device to catch fire and injure the patient. “Fires in oxygen rich environments in a hospital or other health care
facility pose increased risk of serious injury or death to both
patients and device users,’’ she said. She explained that the products were designed for medical emergency
use for both adults and children, and urged healthcare providers with
any of the faulty products to return them to NAFDAC office. “The products, e700, e600 and e500 Automatic Transport Ventilators
are emergency and transport ventilators designed for use before arriving
at the hospital, in the hospital, between hospitals, and in transport
settings. “These ventilators are intended for use with adult, child and infant
patients who are in cardiac arrest or respiratory distress and need
breathing support. “Stop using the device and immediately return any of the units that
have undergone Thin-Film-Transistor (TFT) screen replacement or have had
service performance in the screen area to nearest NAFDAC office. “Healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report
adverse events or side effects related to the use of these products to
the nearest NAFDAC office,’’ she said.
