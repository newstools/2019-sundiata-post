By Edith Ike-Eboh Abuja â€“ The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) says trending social media report of an impending fuel scarcity due to purported refusal by some oil marketers to lift products from depots was false.

He said that the NNPC has over one billion litres of petrol in stock while Imports of 48 vessels of 50million litres each have been committed for the month of April 2019 alone.
