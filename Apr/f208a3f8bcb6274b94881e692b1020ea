Former Green Eagles captain and later coach of Super Eagles, Christian Chukwu (MON) is down with an undisclosed ailment and needs to be flown to the United States of America (USA) for further treatment.This much has been confirmed by the United States based patron of Rangers, Benson Ezeomeogo Ejindu who has moved to raise $50,000 for Chukwu’s treatment in the United States of America (USA).Ejindu told The Nigerian Xpress Sports exclusively from his base in North Carolina, USA that donations have started rolling in for Chukwu, even as he urged lovers of football to save the legend.Ejindu disclosed that he has launched an appeal for Chukwu which he posted on Facebook.The Rangers patron in his Facebook post stated:“For all the lovers of football (soccer), especially those who love African football, one of the legends of that sport is in dire need of medical attention. Christian “Chairman” Chukwu, who captained the famous Enugu Rangers International FC and the Nigeria national team in the 1970s and early 1980s, needs a different type of support – your financial support. Your support, no matter how small, will offset the cost of surgeries and treatments to restore his debilitating health.” Continuing Ejindu stated…”When I received Chukwu’s video (in hospital) , I thought it was an April Fool’s joke…Former players like the late Kenneth Ilodigwe, Christian Madu, Kelechi Emetole, and others who had passed on, could have lived longer, if more hands were on deck to help with their health issues. So, I am asking you to join me, this time round, in raising funds for Chairman Chukwu, who is currently in Nigeria receiving treatments for various ailments. Your financial support will help fly him to the United States for better treatment. We are hoping to raise about $50,000 to cover Christian Chukwu’s round trip flight from Nigeria and all the medical expenses. Leftover funds will help set up a health and welfare account for all Ex Rangers Players.” •Source: The Nigerian Xpress
