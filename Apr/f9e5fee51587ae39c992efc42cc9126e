(Sundiata Post) – Follwing the formal announcement by  the Olowo-in- Council of the sudden departure
of the Olowo of Owo, Oba Folagbade Olateru Olagbegi, President of the Senate,
Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki has expressed sadness over the departure of the late
king and described the death as a big loss to Nigeria at a time the nation’s
leadership  need wise counsel and
experience to solve the various problems confronting her. He described
late Oba Olagbegi as a humane monarch who contributed immensely to the
development of Owo in particular, Ondo State and Nigeria, in general. Saraki, in
statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu,
stated that the late royal father would be remembered for his peaceful
disposition and the leadership he provided in the education sector. He stated
that the legacies of hardwork, integrity and patience of the late monarch left
in the Nigeria Law School where he rose through the ranks to become the
Director General will remain a reference point for a long time. Saraki said:
“The Olowo of Owo was one traditional ruler whose impact extended far beyond
his domain. His contributions to the development of tertiary institutions in
the country as Chancellor of the Universities of Benin, Abuja and Jos
respectively at various times during his lifetime speak volume. “His demise
is a colossal loss to the country in particular and humanity in general. He shall
be dearly missed. “Even
before ascending the throne of his forefathers, Oba Olagbegi was an epitome of
royalty, calm, full of wisdom and dignity personified”, Saraki stated. He
commiserated with the immediate family of the deceased, the Olowo-In-Council,
and the people and government of Ondo State over the irreparable loss. He prayed
God to grant the soul of the deceased eternal peace and his family and loved
ones the fortitude to bear the loss.
