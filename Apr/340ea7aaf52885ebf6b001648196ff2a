Beijing – China’s massive Belt and Road infrastructure programme should only go where it is needed and where the debt it generates can be sustained, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Friday. In brief remarks to nearly 40 world leaders and other high-ranking
officials at China’s second Belt and Road summit in Beijing, Lagarde
said the programme to build ports, railroads and other trade-enhancing
infrastructure was having a positive impact on growth in certain
countries but needed to be managed carefully. She called for a revamped “Belt and Road 2.0” to include increased
transparency, an open procurement process with competitive bidding and
better risk assessment in project selection. “History has taught us that, if not managed carefully, infrastructure
investments can lead to a problematic increase in debt,” Lagarde said
in remarks prepared for delivery at the conference. “I have said before that, to be fully successful, the Belt and Road
should only go where it is needed. I would add today that it should only
go where it is sustainable, in all aspects.” Lagarde said that Chinese authorities were taking positive steps with
a new debt sustainability framework that will be utilized to evaluate
projects. The sustainability initiative was announced on Thursday as China
seeks to allay concerns that the Belt and Road plan to boost trade links
was saddling poor countries with debts they cannot repay. She also applauded the launch of a green investment principle for
Belt and Road projects at the Beijing conference, emphasizing low-carbon
and climate resilient investments. “Debt sustainability and green sustainability will strengthen BRI sustainability,” Lagarde said. The IMF chief said the Belt and Road initiative was helping to
stimulate infrastructure investment and developing new global supply
chains. She cited a new manufacturing zone in Kazakhstan linked to Belt and
Road and construction of a highway in Senegal linking three cities to
the country’s main airport, which has helped underpin strong growth. NAN reports that China in January 2018, launched what it considers
the largest project of the century — building a network of railroads and
shipping lanes linking itself with 70 countries across Asia, Africa,
Europe, and Oceania. The main focuses of the “Belt and Road” initiative — also
known as “One Belt, One Road” — are in infrastructure, transportation,
and energy. Countries including India, Pakistan, Russia, New Zealand and Poland have all joined in the project. Together they make up at least a third of the world’s GDP.
