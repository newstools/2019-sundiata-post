The Police in Cross River state have confirmed the killing of a Police Constable at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) office in Bakassi Local Government Area of the state. Police spokesperson in the state, DSP Irene Ugbo, who confirmed the incident said the policeman whose name was not disclosed was at his duty post when suspected militants stormed the office. She denied that the killing had anything to do with INEC or the just concluded general elections. “No, it doesn’t have anything to do with the INEC,” she said. She said they have launched an investigation into the killing which took place on Monday. Some witnesses who spoke to reporters in Calabar said that help was not immediately available to save the cop, while giving reasons why he bled to death. Findings from residents of Bakassi showed that despite publicly giving up of arms and ammunition by the popular Bakassi Strike Force headed by ‘General’ Franklyn, alias Simply whose real name is Benjamin Ene, and which led the state government in conjunction with some federal agencies, to grant them amnesty, militancy was still rife in Calabar waterways, threatening seafarers and commerce.
