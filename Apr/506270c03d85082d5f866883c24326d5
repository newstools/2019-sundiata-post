By Oboh Linus Lafia – No fewer than 3,800 people benefited from a free medical outreach undertaken by a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Doctor on the Move Africa, on Saturday in Lafia, Nasarawa State. According to Dr Joseph Kigbu, the team leader, the NGO embarked on the outreach to offer medical services to the less-privileged people in the society, and give them a sense of belonging. He said that the team of doctors performed different surgical operations on some of the patients who had glaucoma and cataract. Kigbu, a former legislator, said that apart from free diagnosis and surgery, the organisation gave free drugs to all the patients diagnosed with various diseases. The medical doctor said that he was always touched to see people, especially rural dwellers, struggling to access medical care, even when they had money to pay. “Since God has helped me to be a medical doctor and attained some position in life, I have chosen to also put smiles on the faces of many people who cannot afford healthcare services. “We embarked on this medical outreach as a way of giving something to the society. The areas covered this time are Obi town and Barkin Abdulahi. “We treated different kinds of illnesses. Some came with ulcer, others had typhoid, malarial infections, among others,” he said. Mr Abdullahi Sule, one of the beneficiaries, thanked the NGO for the humanitarian services to the rural people who could not afford healthcare services. Sule, who prayed God to continue to bless the group, said that the medical outreach had helped in reducing the hardship being faced in their respective villages. Another beneficiary, Esther Abisabo, said that she was grateful to God for the opportunity to be treated of  ulcer that had been her major challenge for a long time. (NAN)
