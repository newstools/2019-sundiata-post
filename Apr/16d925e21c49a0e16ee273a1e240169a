  Five daring Nigerian international robbery suspects have been arrested for allegedly robbing a Bureau de Change (BDC) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A report by the US-based THEWILL online newspaper quoted the Sharjah police as saying that the men barged into the BDC and smashed the glass barrier between the customers and the staff, stole the money in multiple currencies and fled. The suspects reportedly fled with cash of different currency worth Dh2.3 million (N226,182,000), the report said. “Two employees at the exchange were injured as they resisted the robbers. One of them managed to notify the police,” according to THEWILL. The Sharjah police, according to the report, “coordinated with forces from Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah and Ajman to arrest the suspects within 48 hours after the robbery was committed. “A top police official said the suspects came to the UAE on visit visas on March 18. Major-General Saif Al Zeri Al Shamsi, Commander-in-Chief of the Sharjah Police, said the whole amount was recovered after the number plate of the car in which the suspects fled, was obtained. “Following this lead, they arrested one of the suspects in Sharjah. This suspect led the police to the others – two in Ajman, one in Abu Dhabi and one in Ras Al Khaimah. “The suspects, who confessed to the crime and said they intended to leave the country, have been referred to the public prosecution.” •Source: TheWill
