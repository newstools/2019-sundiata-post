Following new claim by President Buhari’s campaign media head, Festus Keyamo that you don’t need a WAEC certificate to contest for president or governor in Nigeria as we reported earlier, the former minister and PDP chieftain has reacted that in spite of that, the bone of contention in the Buhari certificate issue is that of perjury. “Buhari may not need a WAEC certificate to contest but once he swore to an affidavit or presented a form indicating that his qualifications include WAEC it becomes a different matter. Or has he withdrawn his WAEC claim?This is a matter of perjury and not whether he is qualified,” he tweeted.
