I did not get married early. I was 38 when I brought my fiancée home. Dad nodded and said: “I don’t have much to tell you. The only thing I want you to know is that along the way your wife will shock you with certain behaviours.” My fiancée and I looked at each other. “Even your old mother shocks me up to this day. But if you keep in mind that that’s how women are created, my son, you’d have the happiest marriage.” And dad was true. I witnessed several shocking behaviours from my wife. Some of them could have led to hot arguments and even divorce, but each time I remember dad’s words “If you keep in mind that that’s how women are created, my son, you’d have the happiest marriage.” Of course, my wife also accuses me of shocking her. I cannot say the contrary. But we keep on. Thank you dad. Source: Quora
