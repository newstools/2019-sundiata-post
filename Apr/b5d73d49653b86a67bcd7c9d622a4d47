By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The All Progressives Congress (APC) has commended President Muhammadu Buhari on his assent to the new and improved N30,000 minimum wage for Nigerian workers. The party reminded that the assent of the N30,000 minimum wage by the president is indeed another election promise delivered. The APC disclosed this in a statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu sent to Sundiata Post. According to the party, “Truly, our workers deserve a new, improved and implementable minimum wage in view of current economic realities. Commendably, the welfare of workers has remained a top priority of the President Buhari-led APC administration as exhibited in the federal government bailouts to state governments to pay workers salary, housing schemes for civil servants among other welfare packages. “We congratulate stakeholders that ensured the achievement of this laudable feat, particularly the National Assembly, state governors, the Amma Pepple-led tripartite committee, labour/trade unions and indeed Nigerian workers. The party further stressed that it is another solid demonstration of a President who matches his words with action. Adding that Nigerians will recall that the President had severally assured of a new and improved national minimum wage for workers.M
