By Raji Rasak Badagry – A civil servant, Florence Ajayi, 43, on Wednesday prayed a Customary Court in Badagry, Lagos, to dissolve her 23-year-old marriage to her husband, Olabisi over alleged battery. The mother of five, who lives in Bayo Bus Stop off 10 Shops,
Aradagun, Badagry, is seeking separation on grounds of  frequent
fighting, irresponsibility and threat to life. Florence told the court that Olabisi married her in 1996 without the
consent of her family, adding that he did not pay any dowry. “My lord, my husband beats me anytime I ask him reasons for not sleeping at home. “Each time my husband answers phone calls from his concubines; he leaves the home and will not sleep at home that day. “As a trained nurse, I built shops inside my husband’s house where I
sell medicines and attend to patients after returning from the hospital
where I work. “Anytime, we have a misunderstanding, after beating me, he will go
right to my shop and scatter my things and send away my customers,” she
said. Florence said that she was no longer interested in the marriage because she fears for her life. She begged the court to dissolve the marriage and that the
respondent, Olabisi, to be responsible for the upkeep of the children. However, Olabisi, 42, denied the allegations levelled against him by Florence. The President of the court, Mr Shakirudeen Adekola, adjourned the
case until April 30 for peaceful settlement by friends of the family who
promised to intervene.
