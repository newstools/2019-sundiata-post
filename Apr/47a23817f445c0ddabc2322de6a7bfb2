By Sunday John Lafia – Mr Yusuf Iya, newly elected Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), in Nasarawa State, has promised to work toward improving the working and living conditions of his colleagues. Iya, who floored Mr Abdullahi Adeka, the former chairman, who wanted a second tenure, said that he would work with all stakeholders toward a better life for the workers. “I dedicate my victory to God and the entire workers. For trusting me with this office, I will never disappoint them. I will always strive to make them happy,” Adeka told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Saturday in Lafia. He described his victory at the polls as “miraculous”, and thanked the workers for standing by him “in spite of enticement and intimidation by some forces who do not mean well for workers”. “Given the sacrifices the workers made to ensure that I’m elected as the NLC Chairman, I will not let them down. “The welfare of the workers will always be the priority of my leadership, by the grace of God. “We will always engage the government meaningfully; we will fight those seeking to oppress workers and will never compromise the workers interest,” he said. The chairman appealed to those who were defeated in the contest for NLC offices to always advise the new leadership on the best steps toward attaining set goals. (NAN)
