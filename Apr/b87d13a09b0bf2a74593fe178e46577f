Augustine Azuka “Jay-Jay” Okocha is a Nigerian former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. A quick and skilful playmaker, who is considered as the best Nigerian and one of the best African players of all time. Okocha releases a breathtaking photo of his beautiful daughter and calls her his “baby girl”, the most interesting part is the caption “rocking” announcing his daughter is single and ready to settle down. Which is obvious that she is a grown-up woman and despite she being a student or she has a career, he is ready to be a grandfather lol! What do you think about his post?
