Tokyo – Residents of Japan will be able to apply for tickets for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games from May 9, the organising committee said on Thursday. Residents will be able to apply through the lottery system, which
runs from May 9 to May 28, before finding out if their applications were
successful on June 20. People living outside of Japan will not be able to apply through the
system but will instead have to buy tickets through country-specific
Authorised Ticket Resellers (ATRs). The distribution system varies from country to country, but
international sales cannot start until June 15. Each National Olympic
Committee (NOC) has been allocated a certain number of tickets to be
sold through their approved ATRs. Tokyo 2020 organisers refused to say how many tickets have been
allocated to each NOC as well as how much commission ATRs would charge
international customers. Between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of all tickets has been reserved
for domestic sales, with the remainder allocated to international
customers and sponsors. Tokyo’s bid for the Olympics said 7.8 million tickets would be
available for the Games but organisers refused to confirm how many were
for sale during the initial offering. Organisers announced domestic ticket prices last year, with rates
ranging from less than $19 for some group tickets up to $2,680, the top
rate for a place at the opening ceremony. The cheapest individual tickets will go on sale for 2,500 yen
($22.34) and, as in previous Games; athletics is the most expensive
event, with the highest priced tickets set at 130,000 yen ($161.68). The Tokyo prices are roughly in line with those for the London
Olympics in 2012, but are more expensive than Rio 2016, although
fluctuating exchange rates make comparisons difficult. This marks only the first wave of ticket sale for the summer showpiece, which begins on July 24, 2020. There will be a further opportunity to purchase tickets in a first-come, first-served process later this year.
