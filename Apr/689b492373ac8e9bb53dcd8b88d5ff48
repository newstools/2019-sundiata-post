By Saketh Sarvepalli Great Start: Ghana gained independence in the 1950s, well before many of its peers in West Africa. This has given the country time to develop economically and politically. Plus, Kwame Nkrumah leading the country after independence was extremely helpful. He managed to limit the power of the Akan and Asante kings and attemepted to unify the country’s people as Ghanians rather than have them identify with their tribes. Infrastructure: Again, Nkrumah was responsible for this. During his presidency, he built many hospitals, schools, and roads. The best example of something from Nkrumah’s time would probably be the Akosombo Dam, which gave power to thousands of people. Furthermore, Nkrumah had the first nuclear research reactor built in Ghana. There are plans to have a nuclear plant built this year. Education: Nkrumah’s policies led to Ghana having one of the highest literacy rates in West Africa. Around 77% in total. Nkrumah made learning arithmetic as well as literacy in English and vernacular languages compulsory. Furthermore today, 90% of Ghana’s kids are enrolled in school, much higher than most countries in the developing world. Natural Resources: Ghana is home to vast amounts of natural resources like gold, diamonds, manganese, bauxite, petroleum, rubber, etc. Ghana’s natural resources sector is so large, that there are fears that it could decrease investment in other sectors.
