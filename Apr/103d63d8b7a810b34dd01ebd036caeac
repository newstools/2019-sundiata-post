he make a powerful utterances about men who’d make heaven or not. The
Prophet who identifies as  Ebenezer Adarkwa Opambour Yiadom is the
leader of the Ebenezer Miracle Worship Center in Kumasi, Ghana has just
recently lay prophecy that got a lot of men uncomfortable. The controversial prophet well known for self-proclaimed spiritual
powers and extreme Christian practices which have ofte sparked national
outrage with many accusing him of being a fake pastor has disclosed that
men with big and oversized manhood will not make it to heaven. According to him, men who fall into the category of promiscuity, 
bleach their skins and do other things just to attract the opposite sex
and men who take pride about their big manhood are bound for hell fire. In his assertion, it encourages lusts among people and tends to
frustrate other men who are less endowed to seek help elsewhere which
later turns out bad for them. In a sermon in his church, Opambour highlighted the need for this
generation to forego worldly lusts and seek the way of the Lord because
judgment beckons everybody. “Nobody is above judgment; not even a beautiful lady with big breasts that satisfy men during sexual intercourse”, he preached. ” You are an honourable man who has bleached your skin, trimmed your
hair; you have done waves and the ladies say you’re handsome; hey fine
boy, you are not above judgment”, he continued. “You’re also a man, all the women say your joystick is big; women are praising you because of your joystick, women are buying you cars, because of your joystick women are even buying you clothes; I’m telling you that your big joystick can’t take you to heaven so repent”, he fumed. source
