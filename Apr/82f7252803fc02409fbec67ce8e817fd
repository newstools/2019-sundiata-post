Geneva – Flood-struck Mozambique received vaccines for a massive cholera immunization campaign after the number of cases quadrupled to over 1,000, a World Health Organisation (WHO) spokesman said in Geneva on Tuesday. The Health Ministry of the southern African country has so far counted 1,052 cases, up from 271 at the weekend. Almost three weeks after Cyclone Idai devastated parts of Mozambique,
the government and aid organisations are planning to start
administering more than 900,000 doses of vaccines against the
water-borne disease on Wednesday. “The next few weeks are crucial and speed is of the essence if we are
to save lives and limit suffering,’’ WHO’s Africa Chief Matshidiso
Moeti said. Mozambique’s government confirmed 598 dead from cyclone Idai and flooding. According to the WHO, over 128,000 people are at a high risk of
contracting cholera and other diseases because they live in make-shift
shelters with poor sanitation. The UN agency is also trying to stem malaria in the wake of the
cyclone by handing out 750,000 bed nets that keep mosquitoes away. “We must do everything we can to protect the people of Mozambique
from a disease outbreak or other health problems caused by lack of
access to essential services,” Moeti said after she visited devastated
communities and clinics in Mozambique.
