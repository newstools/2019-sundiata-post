 Now that he (Transportation Minister Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi) has been disgraced in his Rivers State how does the frog-eyed, pot bellied Creek Haramite feel? The truth is that he was never fit for power in the first place because he was born in the gutter. He crawled out of that gutter but the gutter never crawled our of him. His house boy background has always haunted him and he has no class or character. All the virtues in God’s heaven and on earth are alien to him and he cannot possibly comprehend them let alone espouse or imbibe them. That is why he has always behaved like an animal. A creature from hell that orchestrated the arrest, detention and murder of hundreds of his own Rivers people by outsiders in a futile attempt to win power in Port Harcourt and capture the state is not worthy of public office, honour, deceny or respect. He and his ilk are a sad reflection of what politics and politicians have turned into in Nigeria. I would not put him in charge of my dog kennels or horse stables let alone a Federal Ministry or a state. They took the beast out of the bush but they could not take the bush out of the beast. When a pig wears lipstick it still remains a pig and it still stinks to high heavens. When you put a dog in a palace it still remains a dog and it will defecate on the rug. That is what this Haramite is: a beast in the bush, a pig wearing lipstick and a dog in a palace all rolled into one. May God judge him for his psychotic barbarism and compulsive wickedness and may he pay a terrible price for his sociopathic disposition and vile inclinations both in this world and in the world to come. The blood of those that were killed in the 2019 election in Rivers state will haunt him forever.
