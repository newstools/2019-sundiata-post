ABUJA (Sundiata Post) – The main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said Thursday’s concluding judgment of the Supreme Court, which categorically ended the attempt by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to overturn the governorship, national and state assembly elections in Rivers State, has finally vindicated the PDP, Governor Nyesom Wike and the people of Rivers state Kola Ologbondiyan, national publicity secretary of the PDP, in a statement sent to Sundiata Post on Tuesday night, said “The resoluteness of the Supreme Court in upholding justice and resisting manipulations by APC leaders to revisit the issue of APC flawed primaries in the state, which were lawfully annulled by the lower courts, has brought respite to Nigerians and further restored their confidence in the institution of the judiciary. The spontaneous public jubilation that trailed the concluding judgment attests to this. “The judgment signifies the final triumph of the will of the people over the manipulative forces in APC, who have been deploying all manner of underhand dealings and violence, in their desperation to forcefully take over the control of the state. “The party therefore charges the APC leaders to note that they have come to the end of the road and that though evil may thrive for a moment, truth, justice and the will of the people will always prevail.” He also expressed confidence that “just as the will of the people of Rivers state has been preserved, the PDP presidential mandate, which Nigerians freely gave to Atiku Abubakar on February 23, 2019, but brazenly stolen by the APC, will also be retrieved at the tribunal.”
