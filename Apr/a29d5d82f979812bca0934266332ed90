The Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has stated that the Nigerian team will not have it easy in qualifying for the knock-out rounds of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations as it seems after the draws conducted in Cairo Egypt, on Friday night. Appearing at the AFCON for the first time since winning it in 2013, the Super Eagles have been drawn in Group B alongside Guinea, Madagascar and Burundi. Responding to questions in Cairo, immediately after the draws, Rohr said that what is most important right now is for his players to finish the season in their various clubs healthy, in order to prepare adequately for the Nations Cup. “It is not an easy group because Guinea is a good and young team, Madagascar was the first to qualify for AFCON and Burundi eliminated Gabon en-route to the Nations Cup. So it is not going to be as easy as everyone thinks. “My players will just have to finish well and healthy in their various clubs and then prepare for our friendly matches against Ghana, at home in Nigeria and against Senegal before the start of the tournament in Egypt.” Also reacting, captain Ahmed Musa promised that the players will be ready well ahead of the competition. “We will prepare well for the Nations Cup. With hard work, we will qualify from this group. I wish my colleagues the best of luck in their various clubs, as they round off the season, and prepare for the AFCON. Then, super eagles defender, Leon Balogun took to Twitter to express excitement about the draw. “Group B it is – love the sound of that letter. Looking forward to get started,” he tweeted.
