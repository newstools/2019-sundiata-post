By Awayi Kuje Keffi (Nasarawa State) – The Nasarawa State Board of Internal Revenue Service has appealed to residents in the state to ensure prompt payment of taxes to avoid prosecution. Alhaji Ahmed Yakubu-Mohammed, it Chairman, made the appeal on Monday in Keffi, at the opening of a two-day training workshop organised for its workers and some Judges. He said that the training was aimed at equipping workers and Judges with the skills required for optimal service delivery. The chairman particularly warned Nasarawa residents against dodging or delaying taxes they were expected to pay. “It is when people pay their taxes regularly that government can provide essential services. “In view of this, I want to call on the people of the state to pay their taxes regularly in the interest of development,” he said. Yakubu-Mohammed urged the participants to pay adequate attention to the training to enhance their capacity toward shoring up the revenue generation profile of the state. Also speaking, Dr Abdulkarim Kana, the state’s Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, said that the training was “apt”, coming at a time more revenue was required to meet crucial needs. He called on tax payers to do the needful by paying their taxes in order not to be prosecuted.
