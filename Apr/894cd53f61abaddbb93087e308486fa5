A Nigerian singer has come out on social media to heavily berate a fellow colleague who he has accused of collecting about N15m from him. The Nigerian musical act identified as Demmie Vee recently took to his social media page with a long note addressed to sensational singer and his label boss, Kizz Daniel. He started off by acknowledging his respect for the singer and went ahead without further delay to tag him as a traitor. According to Demmie Veeâ€™s narration, the Madu crooner sent men of the police force to accost him in his home, simply because he requested for a refund of N15m which he claimed the singer cunningly collected from him. He said Daniel had approached his own boss with the promise of heaven and earth, while he was trying to get a recording deal and get him (Demmievee) to join his Flyboy Inc label. Vee continued in his post by making claims that Kizz Daniel had tried to mar his public appeal by messing with his voice on two different songs, Somebody Wait and You Go Wait, and making him sound horrible. He concluded his post by noting that several colleagues had left the singer because of his ways, adding that, sooner or later, the world would see Kizz Daniel for who he truly is.
