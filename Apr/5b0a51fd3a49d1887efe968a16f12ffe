Nairobi â€“ Kenya Airways reported a rise in annual revenue on Tuesday while trimming its pretax loss. The airline, in which Air France-KLM holds a 7.8 percent stake,
reported a revenue of 114.45 billion shillings ($1.13 billion) for the
12 months to December 31, up from 106.17 billion a year earlier. The company has changed to a calendar year from a financial year ending March 31. Its pretax loss narrowed to 7.59 billion shillings from 9.44 billion. The airline was forced to restructure $2 billion worth of debt in
late 2017 after a slump in Kenyan travel following militant attacks.
