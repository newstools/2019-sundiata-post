MILAN – Pope Francis called on Sunday for the evacuation of refugees held in detention camps in Libya as fighting there escalates. Speaking
at the Sunday Angelus prayer at the Vatican, Francis said the already
grave conditions of those in the camps had worsened due to the conflict
under way. “I make an appeal that especially the
women, children and sick can be evacuated as soon as possible through
humanitarian corridors,” he said. Last week the United Nations
refugee agency evacuated 325 African refugees from a detention centre in
southern Tripoli following escalating violence. On
Saturday air strikes hit the Libyan capital as eastern forces loyal to
Khalifa Haftar pursued a three-week campaign to take Tripoli. Pope Francis also called for prayers for those who had died or suffered serious damage in the recent floods in South Africa. (Reuters)
