By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Senate has passed the Nigerian Police Trust
Fund Bill (HB 894). Sundiata Post recalls that Saraki
had last week assured the Inspector General of Police, Mr Mohammed Abubakar
Adamu, that the Senate would fast-track its work on both the Police Trust Fund
Bill and the Police Reform Bill. Reacting to the Senate’s passage
of the Bill, which has also been passed by the House of Representatives,
Saraki, on Tuesday, said: “By passing this bill, we will be creating big
strides towards providing and improving security and the policing in our
country”. “One of the major concerns has
always been the issue of funding. We believe that this bill will provide the
funding needed for training and recruitment. I am confident that by the time we
lay the report on the Police Reform Bill, we would have gone a long way in
moving the police in the right direction.” The Senate President said.
