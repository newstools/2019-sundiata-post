Jessica Onyegbula Abuja – The Federal Government has approved the appointment of Dr Monday Igwe, as the new Medical Director, Federal Neuropsychiatric hospital, Enugu. This was made known in a statement by Boade Akinola, Director, Media and Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Health on Friday in Abuja. According to the statement, the appointment is for an initial term of four years with effect from 1st April. Congratulating Igwe on his new appointment, the Minister of State, Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, reminded him of the enormous responsibilities of his office and the yearnings of Nigerians for an effective and responsive healthcare delivery system. Ehanire further advised Igwe to justify the confidence reposed on him by the President towards ensuring industrial harmony in the Health sector and in support of Mr President’s Change Agenda. The former medical director, Dr Jojo Onwukwe was suspended by the Board of the Hospital, over various issues on Jan. 10. The hospital board chairman, Mr Shaban Shuaibu had written a letter to the health ministry on the challenges with Onwukwe. “Dr. Onwukwe has refused to implement board decisions, instead he gives counter directives to the staff and withholds correspondences, ignores phone calls and text messages of the chairman and members of the Board, even going as far as summoning Board members, including the chairman, to meetings on his own assumed authority. “Matters came to a head when he tried to usurp or scuttle the process of selection of a new Medical Director refusing to call Board meeting to ratify the report of the Appointment, Promotion and Disciplinary Committees on the process and instead invited the ministry, summoned the Board and invited shortlisted candidates for an interview and deliberately refused to invite the Federal Character Commission that has constitutional mandate to monitor the process of recruitment exercise of this magnitude,” Shuaibu said in the letter.
