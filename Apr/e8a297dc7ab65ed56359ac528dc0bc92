Most people, especially wealthy people, would say that Canadian Citizenship is infinitely more valuable … Why? The USA passport is the “most expensive document in the world” because USA passport holders have to file a lot of periodic & annual reports revealing all their assets; They have to file these papers & pay USA income taxes (or face criminal penalties) even if they don’t live in the USA. Canadian citizens, once they leave Canada have no paperwork nor financial obligations to Canada. Further, USA citizens abroad are often called “Toxic Americans” by bankers and business people. Why? Because so many non-Americans who will no longer do business or open accounts for Americans. Those who do business with them have been fined, jailed & otherwise get into serious trouble for “conspiracies,” embargo breaking, and many other things that the USA considers criminal —but which may not be crimes in their own country. For poor but ambitious and talented people, living and working the USA may offer more opportunity. But one can live & work in the USA without ever seeking citizenship. This is not meant to be a rant against the USA, but it is IMO what most bankers and lawyers would tell a prospective USA citizen. Source: Quora
