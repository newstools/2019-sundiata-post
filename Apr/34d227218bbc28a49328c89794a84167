Washington – The NATO foreign ministers’ meeting  in Washington will focus on emerging Russian threats to the alliance, in addition to talks on Afghanistan and increased financial burden sharing, a senior U.S. Official said. The official also repeated warnings to Turkey not to purchase the Russian S-400 air defence system, saying such a move risks not only removing Ankara from the F-35 stealth fighter jet programme, but also triggering sanctions. Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, just ahead of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, the senior State Department official said the alliance “remains strong and unified’’. Trump has repeatedly expressed his own doubts about the alliance, in particular voicing concern about the mutual defence clause. The president’s key issue, however, has been financial, as he rails against nations that fail to meet the target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence. The official said there will be an “honest discussion on burden sharing’’ at the ministerial. Ministers are gathering to mark the alliance’s 70th anniversary. Stoltenberg is set to address Congress on Wednesday before the ministerial kicks off in the evening and extends into the next day. “All elements of the Russian threat are to be discussed,’’ the official said, listing concerns ranging from Moscow’s military interventions in Ukraine and Georgia, to election interference and the Skripal attack in Britain. More recently, the U.S. has been irked by Moscow’s support for Venezuela. Turkey too is backing the government there. Regarding troop levels in Afghanistan, the official indicated that a peace process was ongoing and that any reduction in military presence in that country would likely depend on the outcome of the negotiations.
