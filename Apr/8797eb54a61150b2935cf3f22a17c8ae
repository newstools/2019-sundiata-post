By Ismaila chafe Abuja – President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over “the latest needless violent clashes between Jukuns and Tivs in Taraba State, and Fulani, Genjon and Bachama in Adamawa resulting in arson, injuries and deaths”. Buhari made his feelings known in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Saturday. He said: ”Violence and bloodshed for whatever reason is unacceptable and condemnable, especially when it is coming as the nation celebrates Easter, with all the lessons of love and peace for humanity. ”Violence has not and cannot be the solution to the resolution of misunderstandings among the people. “Once we abandon reason and good judgement, we are giving violence the chance to take over and make a bad situation more complicated and difficult to resolve.’’ The president maintained that the ”primary initiative for ending violence once and for all must originate from the local actors involved in these clashes.” Buhari reassured Nigerians that his administration would not rest on its oars to provide security for all. He said government would at the same time ”engage in dialogue with local stakeholders in order to get to the root of the crises.” The president mandated a religious group involved in stitching up broken relationships between communities in Plateau State to work with security agencies in reconciling communities in Kaduna, Taraba and Adamawa states. ”The President has also directed the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA and the National Commission for Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons to scale up their efforts in bringing succour to displaced people. ”President Buhari assured that immediate intervention by the military has brought calm back to communities,” the statement quoted Buhari as saying.(NAN)
