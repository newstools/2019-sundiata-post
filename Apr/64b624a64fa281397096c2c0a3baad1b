By Sani Abdulrahman Kaduna – A Kaduna State-based housewife, Maryam Musa , has dragged her husband, Abbas, before a Sharia Court II sitting at Magajin Gari, over frequently beatings. Maryam also told the court that her estranged husband was arrogant. ”Whenever we have an argument, he beats me up. He also punches. ”My husband is also in the habit of telling people that he spends a lot of money on me. ”Why would he be bragging about spending money on me? Is it not his responsibility to take care of me,’’ she said. Abbas, however, denied all the allegations. ”I have never bragged about spending a penny on her. ”When I married Maryam, she had some spiritual afflictions. I have
visited many native doctors to find solutions to her afflictions,” he
said. The judge, Musa Sa’ad-Goma, ordered the complainant to come along with her witness to testify to her claims of battery. Sa’ad-Goma adjourned the case until April 16 for further hearing.
