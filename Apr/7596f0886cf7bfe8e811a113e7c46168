By Hauwa Gold Abuja – A civil servant, Ifenekwe Okechukwu, on Friday appeared in a Wuse Zone II Chief Magistrates’ Court in Abuja over failure to produce an accused in a criminal case. Okechukwu, who works in the Legal Department National Lottery
Regulatory Commission, Jabi district Abuja, is charged with screening of
an offender. The Prosecutor, Mr A. O. Olaofe, told the court that the case was reported to the Chief Magistrate sometime in May 2016. Olaofe said Okechukwu stood as surety for Joy Amaukwu, who is charged
with criminal breach of trust, cheating and issuance of dud cheque

in the sum of N100,000  and adjourned the case until May 15, for further
mention.
