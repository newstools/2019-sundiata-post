By Nabilu Balarabe Gumel – The Jigawa Primary Health care Development Agency (JPHDA) said it has targeted 155,395 people Gumel Local Government Area of the state for treatment against trachoma. Trachoma is a bacterial infection of the eyes that can lead to blindness if not properly treated. Alhaji Habu Magaji, the JPHDA Manager in the area told the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Gumel on Monday that the agency has acquired
azithromycin and tetracycline eye ointment to control the spread of the
disease in Gumel and neighbouring Suletankarkar and Gagarawa Local
Government Areas. Magaji said the agency will soon dispense the drugs for persons aged five  and above. The manager said heads of health facilities had already been  trained in administering the drugs. “ Trachoma is caused by a bacteria called chlamydia trachomatis,
which is transmitted to humans mostly by flies from open defecation. “ People who contract the disease show  symptoms including itching, mucus discharge and blurred vision,” the manager said. He noted that the bacteria that causes the disease can be spread by
both direct and indirect contact with an affected person’s eyes or nose. Magaji, therefore, urged residents to avoid open defecation, saying
personal hygiene and environmental sanitation were critical to
prevention against trachoma.
