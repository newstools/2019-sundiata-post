The Prime Minister of Israel will express his gratitude towards Donald Trump by naming a region in the country after him. Addressing the nation in a YouTube video today, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed he would be naming a community or neighbourhood in the Golan Heights, a rocky plateau seized from south-western Syria, after the 45th American President. The announcement comes after President Trump recognized the nation’s sovereignty over the region which is located north of the country. In his video Prime Minister Netanyahu said: ‘I’m here on the beautiful Golan Heights. ‘All Israelis were deeply moved when President Trump made his historic decision to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights ‘Therefore after the passover holiday, I intend to bring to the government a resolution calling for a new community on the Golan Heights named after President Donald J Trump.’ The Israeli Prime Minister is currently touring the mountainous region with his family for the Jewish Passover festival. His calls for a new area to be named after the American President comes after the Trump Administration defied tradition and signed a proclamation recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights at the White House in March 2019 Israel first annexed the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and the region soon fell under Israeli military control. In 2017 Trump also broke decades of U.S. policy and announced that he recognized Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. Daily Mail.
