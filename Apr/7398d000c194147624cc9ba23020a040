A gang of armed robbers on Monday attacked a branch of a commercial bank at Ido Ani town, in Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State. It was gathered that an unspecified amount of money was allegedly stolen by the bandits, who were said to have broken the door of the bank with a substance suspected to be dynamites. It was also learnt that social and business activities in the town were paralysed for several hours as human and vehicular movements stopped while the robbery was going on. Residents of the town were said to run helter-skelter for safety to avoid stray bullets. According to a source in the town, many people were feared killed while some sustained injuries as the robbers were said to be shooting indiscriminately during the robbery. The source said, having got the information about the robbery, the combined team of policemen and soldiers stormed the scene and engaged the hoodlums in a gun duel.
