 Stockholm – Antti Rinne, the leader of Finland’s Social Democrats, was on Friday given the task of mobilisation toward the formation of a new government after the recent general election. He was assigned by leaders of the parliamentary party groups. The move was expected as the Social Democrats became the largest
party in the 200-seat legislature with 40 seats, a gain of six, in the
April 14 parliamentary election. As the largest party, the Social Democrats have the first shot at forming a new government. Rinne later told newsmen he had compiled a list of questions for the other parties to consider. The replies would help him gauge their stance on different issues and possible inclusion in government. The queries ranged from climate change, foreign policy and defence to
how to strengthen the rule of law, the labour market and public
finances. Rinne said he expected the replies by April 30. He added there would likely be the need for more consultations in the
following days before formal talks could possibly open around May 8. “To promote transparency the answers would also be published on parliament’s website,’’ he said. Earlier this week, Rinne was elected the speaker of parliament. Report says the 56-year-old former trade union leader is expected to resign as speaker if he becomes prime minister. In July, Finland takes over the rotating EU presidency from Romania,
while this has contributed to a sense of urgency to form a government. Interim Prime Minister Juha Sipila and his centre-right coalition are to stay on as caretaker pending a new government.
