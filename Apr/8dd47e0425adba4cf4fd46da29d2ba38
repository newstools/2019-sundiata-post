A 17-year-old boy identified as Aliyu and his 15-year-old fiancée,
Aisha, have released their prewedding pictures ahead of their wedding,
next week, in Sokoto.
 
It was scooped that Aliyu is following his family tradition of
marrying early. The male children of his family marry at the age of 17,
while the female ones marry at 15. However, in extreme cases, they marry at the age of 19. The
tradition was allegedly embraced to prevent them from fornicating and
also to allow them see their grandchildren.  (Tori.ng)
