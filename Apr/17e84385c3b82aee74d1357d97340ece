were injured, including a mother, her child and a 27-year-old man. “It was terrifying,” said Esther Nelson, a biotech research assistant
who was working in a building nearby and saw the crane fall from a
break-room window. “I looked up the wind was blowing really strong. I saw boats
struggling on Lake Union. Then the crane – maybe eight or nine stories
high broke in half. “Half of it was flying down sideways on the building. The other half fell down on the street, crossing both lanes of traffic.” According to the fire chief, among the four dead were the two crane operators and two other persons in separate vehicles. He said that four others were injured, including a mother and child
who were in satisfactory condition. A 27-year-old man was in serious
condition, and a fourth person was treated at the scene. Authorities had not identified the victims by name as The King

dead until Monday. Seattle activated its emergency operations centre Saturday afternoon to coordinate the response.
