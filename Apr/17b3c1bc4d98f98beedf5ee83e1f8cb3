Nollywood actress, Regina Daniels’ ex-boyfriend, Somadina Adinma, may have been at the receiving end over the actress’ new-found love life with billionaire Ned Nwoko. The duo was once an ‘item’ that they hardly posted photos without each other featuring on social media.S But
since news broke that the actress has been wedded to the billionaire
and flaunting her luxurious life on social media, fans have been seeking
to know about Soma, who didn’t flinch over the rumours. But now that it has been established that Regina Daniels is officially Ned Nwoko’s fifth wife, some fans have taken to Soma’s page to mock him over the lost opportunity he had with the beautiful actress. (Lailasnews)
