Troops of the Operation Whirl Stroke have rescued three kidnapped victims in Benue State. The victims were alleged to have been kidnapped by one Terwase Akwaza, a leader of the Benue militia. According to the Benue State Governor, Mr Samuel Ortom who spoke during a meeting with the victims at the government house, said, the security operatives have been mandated to arrest any group fermenting trouble. “The same family that was kidnapped in February have now been rescued by the operation whirl stroke. We are going to intensify this, we know a couple of them out there who have gone through this kind of torture, and this will not be allowed. “We shall ensure that criminality is eliminated. In the past, all attempts to ensure that we eliminate these criminal elements; the people themselves from those communities resisted, by yesterday, they willingly surrendered and said the government should act. He added that; “This government will give adequate support to the security agencies to ensure that this is eliminated.” The Governor lauded the efforts of the community leaders for calling the government to their aid, after several attempts to get their full cooperation. “Thank God the people of Sankera met with me and they gave us the latitude to do whatever we can to ensure that we stop the criminality that is going on around Sankera area, particularly in Katsina-Ala LGA. The government, security chiefs and the community leaders held a stakeholders meeting, where they denounced the militias, including their alleged leader, Terwase Akwaza. Source: Channels TV
