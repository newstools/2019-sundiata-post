Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Saudi Arabia said it
executed 37 of its citizens on Tuesday after they were convicted of “terrorism”
in the kingdom, which is one of the world’s top executioners. The sentences were carried out in Riyadh, the Muslim holy cities
of Mecca and Medina, central Qassim province and Eastern Province, home to the
country’s Shiite minority. The men were executed “for adopting terrorist and extremist
thinking and for forming terrorist cells to corrupt and destabilise security”,
a statement published by the official Saudi Press Agency said. It said that one person was crucified after his execution, a
punishment reserved for particularly serious crimes. Executions in the ultra-conservative kingdom are usually carried
out by beheading. At least 100 people have been executed in Saudi Arabia since the
beginning of the year, according to a count based on official data released by
SPA. Last year, the oil-rich Gulf state carried out the death
sentences of 149 people, according to Amnesty International, which said only
Iran was known to have executed more people. Rights experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the
fairness of trials in Saudi Arabia, governed under a strict form of Islamic
law. People convicted of terrorism, homicide, rape, armed robbery and
drug trafficking face the death penalty, which the government says is a
deterrent for further crime. SOURCE: Newsbreak Network
