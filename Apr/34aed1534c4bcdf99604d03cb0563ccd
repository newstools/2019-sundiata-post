Kenyan Singer and former Chocolate city artist Victoria Kimani joined the #FvckYouChallenge currently making waves on social media to call out artists like Ycee and Tiwa Savage. She sang that singer YCEE stole her lyrics and released it as the popular JUICE song. She further threw subs at who many believe is Tiwa Savage with lyrics; 
“African bad gal turning 45 and still selling p*ssy” A reference to Tiwa Savage song Malo where she sang about being ‘Number one African bad gal.’ Kimani further sang, ‘you can block my shows but can’t block my blessings,’ an attempt to mirror a music industry where big artists like Tiwa Savage have perhaps been able to call the shots in favour of a few. Just a speculation informed by her lyrics. She went ahead to post an event poster showing all male lineups except for the single inclusion of Tiwa as the only female artist.
