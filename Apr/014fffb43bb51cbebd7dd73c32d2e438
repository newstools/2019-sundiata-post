British actor, Idris Elba and his love Sabrina Dhowre tied the knot in Marrakech, Morocco last Friday April 26th, but it was kept a secret from the news until after about 24 hours. The other thing that was kept secret, even from Sabrina, was that Davido was to make a special appearance. Elba had requested Davido’s presence, according to music industry mogul Efe Ogbeni of Stealth Management‘s post on Instagram. He said: @idriselba “Efe l want kid bro @davidoofficial to come surprise my wife, this CANNOT leak, and we can’t have anyone know “ my goodness, @missamadi myself @ronawigs2.0 @oronde had to do major operation .
