Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Special Adviser to former
President Goodluck Jonathan, Pastor Reno Omokri has just returned from a
spiritual mission to Mount Everest. Reno who said he went in pursuit of #Free
LeahSharibu movement, informed that he brought a message for those who have demanded
that he be their mentor. Reno sad while he was in Mount Everest in Nepal, he was
inspired to pass on a message to many who have made requests of him and to humanity
in general. According to Reno, “Why ask me to be your mentor when you can
have my Mentor? He is greater than ANY prophet that ever lived. He divided time
(BC/AD). He is Yehoshu’a. If you must follow me, follow me to the extent I
follow Him. He
disclosed this when he took his twitter handle @renoomokri shortly after the
spiritual mission thus: “I have just returned from a spiritual

EXCEPT His Father. My Mentor is respected by EVERY religion on Earth. They may
not agree with Him, but they can’t ignore HIM. Without Him, I Am NOTHING. I‘m
