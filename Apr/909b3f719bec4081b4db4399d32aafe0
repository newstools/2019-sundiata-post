The National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, has denied increasing corps members monthly allowance from N19,800 to N31,800. The
scheme tagged the reports making the rounds on social media that
serving corps members will be paid N31,800 as monthly stipends, as fake
news. A Deputy Director at the NYSC headquarters Abuja, Eddy Megwa
told Vanguard on Wednesday that the federal government is yet to inform
the Scheme of any increases in the stipends of serving corps members. He
stressed that though the NYSC does not pay corps members directly, the
federal government will inform the Scheme of any increases before a
stipend figure different from the current N19,800 is made available to
the public. Eddy Megwa said; “The
NYSC does not pay corps members any sum of money directly as stipends
but the federal government does. “Until the government is ready to
implement the N30,000 minimum wage, we cannot say what corps members
will earn for their service to the nation. “Disregard any figure
you find making the rounds on social media. When the federal government
is ready, it will inform NYSC and we will announce it to corps members
through official channels.”
