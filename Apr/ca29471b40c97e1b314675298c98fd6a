By Joan Nwagwu Abuja – The Cultural Trade Group under the aegies of the Radio, Television, Theatre and Arts Workers Union of Nigeria (RATTAWU) has urged the Federal Government to fund tourism in order to stimulate the Nation’s economy. Mr Akpausoh Akpausoh, General Secretary of RATTAWU said this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja. He said that there was need for government to revamp the Cultural
Heritage of the country and stimulate the tourism sector in Nigeria in
order to benefit from the various opportunities of the sector. “We call on the government and other stakeholders in the cultural
sector to demonstrate the relevance of culture by stimulating tourism
that is fast becoming a money spinning venture for many countries. “We also express worry over the poor funding of the Ministries,
Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in the cultural sector which has been a
huge setback to the actualisation of their goals of growing the sector,”
he said. The general secretary of the group, while congratulating the incoming
governors for their victory at the polls, appealed to them especially
the various States that were yet to have befitting cultural centres to
consider such as their priority projects. Akpausoh, however, urged the governors to support their states’
Troupes financially to attend the annual Cultural Festivals and
Carnivals. He, therefore, appealed to governments at all levels to ensure that
professionals within the system were appointed to head the various MDAs
within the cultural sector to enhance professionalism. He further called on the governments to consider the need to employ
more staff into the sector to replace those who were retiring. Akpausoh added that following the achievements recorded so far by the
present administration of the RATTAWU, led by Mr Garba Tsanni, the
trade group moved a vote of confidence on the leadership of the union.
