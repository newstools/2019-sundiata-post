By Didier Champion This is a good explanation of what it means to be a “ third-world” country. The countries that were generally aligned with NATO and opposed to the Soviet Union during the Cold War are First World countries. Second World is the former industrial socialist states(formally the Eastern Bloc) largely encompassing territories under the influence of the Soviet Union. Third World countries are the countries that remained non-aligned with either NATO or the Communist Bloc. From the map above, you can see that not all African countries were “third-world”. Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, and Djibouti was the “second” world. Angola, South Africa, Western Sahara, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were all “ first-world”. The rest of the African countries were “third-world”. Source: Quora
