Popular Comedian turned Radio host, Felix Oduor alias Jalang’o, has stirred a storm on social media with his ‘reckless’ remarks over the brutal murder of Moi University Student, Ivy Wangeci. 
The sixth year medical student was murdered in cold blood by a man identified as Naftal Kinuthia after she turned down his advances. Jalang’o insinuated that Ivy is partly to blame for her death for receiving gifts and money from the guy who killed her. He went on to advise ladies not to accept favors from men if they know they cannot pay back in kind. Read the post he wrote on IG that he has since deleted below.
