By Usman Aliyu Ilorin â€“ The Ilorin Emirate Youth Development Association (IEYDA) has urged the Federal Government to consider an immediate repair of the deplorable portions of Budo-Egba/Otte in Asa Local Government Area of Kwara. The National President of the Ilorin Emirate Youth Development
Association, Alhaji Babatunde Salaudeen made the call on Tuesday when he
led other members of the association to barricade the damage portions
of the road. Salaudeen said that the appeal would ensure the safety of the citizens plying the road. According to him, the road needed the urgent attention of both the
federal and state governments to prevent occurence of accidents. He urged the Federal Ministry of Works and Transport and the Federal
Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) to urgently come to the aid of motorists
and passenger to fix the bad portions. Speaking, National Publicity Secretary, IEYDA, Alhaji Muhammed
Jagunma, said the road in question linked South-West and North-Central
of the country, hence its economic importance. Jagunma said that the association visited the area with a view to
finding a temporary solution, but observed that the issue was beyond its
efforts. In their separate remarks, the Chairman of the Budo-Egba Community,
Mallam Abdulganiyu Idiaro and the Chairman Otte Descendants Union,
Mallam Ishola Saka commended the stride of the state and the Federal
Government in road infrastructure. They also urged the governments to construct drainages to allow free flow of water in the affected portions.
