By Kabir Muhammad Abuja – An investment company based in the Federal Capital Territory has made a donation of four units of three bedroom accommodation to shelter over 200 orphans recently displaced in Abuja. The orphanage where the children were living was demolished by the FCT Department of Development Control. Making the donation on Wednesday in Abuja, Chief Executive Officer of
Cosgrove Investment Limited, Mr Umar Abdullahi said the donation is
part of the company’s corporate social responsibility. According to him, the gesture was in line with the company’s policy of caring for the less privileged in the society. He said since the news broke out a couple of weeks ago, the firm has
been making arrangements to see that the displaced children are
accommodated in a decent environment for a reasonable period of time. Abdullahi stressed that the children will be sheltered for a period of one year by the company. ”This is not the first time Cosgrove has embarked on humanitarian service as part of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). ”We have provided educational service to the less privileged in the
society and just recently we constructed 1.5 kilometers road in Katampe
district in Abuja to ease movement for residents of the area. “So, when this happened, we felt we should come to their aid to
cushion the effect on these affected children. And we will continue to
render such humanitarian services whenever the need arises”, he said. Responding, the FCT Permanent Secretary, Mr Christian Ohaa, commended
the firm for coming to the aid of the FCT Administration in time of
need. Ohaa called on other firms operating in the Federal Capital Territory
to emulate Cosgrove Investment Limited in assisting the less privileged
in the society.(NAN)
