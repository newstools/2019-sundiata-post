The NAHCON boss acknowledged VHS Tasheel for their preparedness in starting the process immediately. The chairman aslo commended the state boards currently performing the exercise for their cooperation. Muhammad urged other state pilgrims’ boards to emulate those states that had fulfilled all registration requirements which enabled them to begin the data-capturing for their pilgrims.
