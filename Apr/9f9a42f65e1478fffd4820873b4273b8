(Sundiata Post) – Amid claims and counter claims that Kogi State government
owed its state workers for close to 38 months, 
a Network of Kogi State Associations has written to the Accountant
General of the federation (AGF), seeking authentication of the sum of N309.75
billion accrued to the state in over three and half years. The letter
which was signed by the General Secretary of the Association, Mr.  Atekojo Samson Usman and made available to
Sundiata Post, urged the AGF to authenticate the inflow of funds to Alhaji
Yahaya Bello’s administration since January, 2016 till date. The Network
of Kogi Associations which serves as the umbrella body to numerous
socio-cultural and Socio-political groups across the state noted that the move
was in the interest of the state. Part of the
letter reads:  “As bona fide
citizens of Kogi State, we, wish to request your good office to expeditiously
and comprehensively authenticate financial releases to Kogi State
government,  since Alhaji Yahaya Adoza
Bello assumed office on 27th January, 
2016.” The letter
indicates that Kogi State under Governor Bello obtained,   “loans between May,  2017 and January,  2018, got Paris Club refunds in three
tranches, got bail out refund from the Federal government as well as statutory
allocation for the state and local governments.” Kogi State
workers’ salary mess in the current administration has put Yahaya Bello under
pressure with the renewed calls by Labour leaders in the state to begin
implementation of the recently approved N30,000 minimum wage.
