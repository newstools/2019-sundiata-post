By Ibukun Emiola Ibadan – The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) Oyo State chapter, has affirmed its solidarity with the protesting students of the Ibarapa Polytechnic Eruwa, Oyo State. This was contained in a statement by the Chairman Oyo State Chapter
of the association, Mr Olujuwon Asubiojo in Ibadan on Wednesday. Asubiojo said that NANS demands for the immediate funding of the
institution by the State Government and also an account  of the N5,500
reparation fee paid by all students of the institution to its
management. “The National Association of Nigerian Students, Oyo State chapter
wishes to affirm our solidarity and support for the students of the
Ibarapa Polytechnic Eruwa, who after finishing their academic programme
since 2017 are yet to be mobilised for the mandatory National Youth
Service Corps Programme. “In a meeting between NANS executives, the management and other
students union bodies today (Wednesday, 24th of April, 2019) after
series of protests, the management pointed to inadequate funding by the
government as the reason for the delayed accreditation of important
courses in the institution which is preventing the students from being
mobilised for service. “We, therefore, urge the state government to save the future of these
students by releasing enough funds for the accreditation process. “We also call for public accountability of the money generated from
the sum of N5,500 reparation fee, paid by all students of the
institution. “We will not hesitate to take decisive actions if this situation is not promptly attended to,” he said.
