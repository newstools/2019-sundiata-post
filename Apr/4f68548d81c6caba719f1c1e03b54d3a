Wuhan – Chinese researchers have developed a medical system to reduce blind spots in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) including the esophagus and stomach. The ENDOANGEL monitoring system uses artificial intelligence to identify blind
spots during UGE to avoid missing the diagnosis of digestive diseases. It draws images of people’s digestive tracts and labels the spots which need to
be checked. The system can capture and store typical images of different sites of the
stomach, as well as automatically generate medical reports with higher file
integrity than endoscope physicians. The average accuracy of the ENDOANGEL on monitoring UGE blind spots is above
90 per cent. A randomised controlled trial showed that the blind spot rate of 153 patients was
5.9 per cent with the assistance of ENDOANGEL, remarkably lower than 22.5 per cent
of 150 patients in normal UGE without ENDOANGEL. After two-year development by researchers at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University,
ENDOANGEL has been applied in clinical trials and was proved to be helpful in
clinical setting.
