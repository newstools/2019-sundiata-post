İgbaugba Ehigimetor Benin – The Election Petition Tribunal in Benin has rejected the prayer by the PDP candidate in the March 9 Etsako Federal Constituency election for the recounting of the ballot papers used for the poll. The Tribunal Chairman, Justice O. Ogundana, on Tuesday, dismissed the
plea of the petitioner, Mr Blessing Agbomere, in a ruling on the
application filed by his counsel, Mr Chika Adindu. Agbomere is challenging the declaration of Mr Johnson Oghuma of the
All Progressives Congress (APC) as the winner of the election. İn the application the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate had
requested for the recounting and finger print assessment of the ballot
papers used for the poll. İn rejecting the application, the tribunal ruled that there was no
provision in the Electoral Act as amended​ for the recounting of ballot
papers after declaration of election results. “At the place of voting, the polling officers can allow the agents to count. “Recounting and finger print assessment does not have any correlation
with errors or miscalculation; as a result, the application lacks merit
and is hereby dismissed,” the judge said. The tribunal subsequently announced June 11 for the commencement of substantive hearing on the petition.
