By Francisca Oluyole Abuja – The Small Scale and Artisanal Miners Association of Nigeria on Thursday decried alleged neglect and uder-representation of its members in the activities of Federal Government. Alhaji Nasiru Wada, the Chairman of the association made this known while briefing newsmen during its inaugural meetung on Thursday in Abuja. He said that the small scale miners in Nigeria had been yearning for assistance and improvement but did not have the voice to convey their message to the government and other relevant agencies. ” Millions of small scale miners in Nigeria do not have a voice or group that can represent them and present their needs and interface with the government and other agencies that are involved in the mining sector. “In view of this issue and the recent ban of mining activities in Zamfara, we have registered this association (Small Scale and Artisanal Miners Association of Nigeria) with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). ” We set up the association to give small scale artisanal miners a voice in the mining sector and to also collaborate with relevant stakeholders in the sector,” he said. He went further that “We know that there is Miner Association Nigeria (MAN) which has been existing for more than 60 years, but our own association is to focus on small scale and artisanal miners. “We are not in competition with MAN,  we are a specialised association, we only want to deal with issue of small scale miners in Nigeria because they are under-represented, they have no voice. He said that the association would organise stakeholders’ forum which would involve security agencies, mining sector, cattle herders among others to proffer solutions to the problem militating against the peace of Nigeria. “The forum will also proffer economic emancipation for our teeming youths living in abject poverty,” he said.
