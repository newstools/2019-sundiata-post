A student of the Federal Polytechnic Oko, Anambra State, has allegedly reportedly committed suicide few days ago. The man who was fondly referred to as HOD, reportedly called his close friends on Wednesday, to tell them that he was going on a journey of no return before drinking Sniper, the infamous lethal pesticide which has become a popular choice for suicidal Nigerians. His friends and classmates have since taken to social media to mourn the loss. A friend who shared the sad news, Chinedu Valentine wrote: Who can tell me this personâ€¦â€¦.
