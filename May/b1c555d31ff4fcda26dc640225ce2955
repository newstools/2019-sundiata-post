By Lucy Ogalue Abuja. -. Most Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)  on Wednesday witnessed low turn out of customers.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)  reports that at the time of filing this report, very few customers were seen making different transactions at the ATMs.Some of the banks visited were Fidelity and Stanbic IBTC ATMs in Shoprite, Apo, Jaiz bank, Guarantee Trust Bank, Apo, Eco and Zenith banks, Garki.Some of the customers seen making different transactions attributed the low turn out of customers to the fact that salaries for May had not been paid.A customer at the Fidelity Bank, Miss Grace Orseer,  said  she was not expecting to meet a long queue even with the public holiday.“I am a civil servant and my salary has not been paid yet and i am sure the situation is the same for some of my colleagues.“We are just happy we have the day off from work to attend to some family needs.“I am just here basically to get a little money to do some necessary shopping.Another customer,  Mr Chuks Nwandu,  said he met a little queue on his arrival but it was nothing unusual at shoprite.According to Nwandu,  there is no money in the country for one to engage in extravagant spending.He urged President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure a better living condition for Nigerians in his second term to alleviate the sufferings of the people.Similarly, at Zenith bank, very few customers were seen making different transaction.Mr Smart Adewole said: ” as you can see, there is little queue and the ATMs are dispensing cash so it is a good way to spend the holiday.“This is a short break,  so I do not expect that there will be issue of ATMs not dispensing cash as it should.“However,  the Sallah break is by the corner and I hope the management of the various banks will ensure the ATMs are working appropriately during that holiday.“It is annoying to drive all the way to get some cash only for you to spend hours on queue because of ATM malfunctioning.“So,  this is a welcome development and the banks should keep it up.”Also, Miss Bilikisu Bello at Eco bank, while congratulating Buhari on his inauguration,  prayed that his second term would mean well  for Nigerians.“I think this issue of suicide here and there in the country is because there is no money in the economy and people are suffering.“I pray the president will do something about this situation and fast, so that Nigerians will be happy and have better lives,” Bello said.NAN reports that the Federal Government had declared Wednesday, May 29, as work-free day to mark the 2019 presidential inauguration
