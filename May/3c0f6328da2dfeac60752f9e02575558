  It is with this in mind that I commend Justice Bulkachuwa for recusing herself from the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal Panel hearing my petition against the Independent National Electoral Commission and the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, President Muhammadu Buhari. Her action showed courage and is an act of patriotism. She has, by this action, increased the confidence the public have for the judiciary. Not only do I commend her, I also pray, especially in this holy month of Ramadan, that Justice will be done by the tribunal according to the fear of God and not in keeping with respect for the powers that be. May God bless the judiciary and may God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Atiku Abubakar
