By Didier Champion I like to visit low income countries with a good track record of peace, safety, and political stability. I get affordable trips and that way, I can go to more countries. Zanzibar and Tanzania. The best words I keep hearing is that Zanzibar is a paradise island on earth. I gotta make a trip out there to see it myself. A friend of mine just got back and when I asked him his impressions. He simply said. When I die, simply bury me in Zanzibar. I will be going there in the end of 2019 and could not have been more excited. Cape Verde. This is another island in the Atlantic Ocean on the West Coast of the African continent. It is very beautiful and had lots of history. You canâ€™t go wrong with the beach. Apparently, only 1% of Africans can locate it on the map. What a shame! Senegal. This is one of the Francophone countries I admire. They have been sending me good vibes. Their presidential elections have no political drama and they are building strong institutions for a promising nation. I would like to see the African Monument Renaissance and the museum of black civilizations. Source: Quora
