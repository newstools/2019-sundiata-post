Berlin – German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet on Wednesday backed an extension of Germany’s participation in a United Nations-led mission in Lebanon (UNIFIL) by another year. Merkel and her ministers gave the green light for the mission to continue until June 30, 2020. The mandate, which allows Germany to station up to 300 troops in the country, still has to be approved by parliament. UNIFIL is one of the UN’s oldest peacekeeping missions, started in
March 1978 to maintain a truce between Israel and Lebanon and also
ensure security within the country. Its mandate is currently set to expire on Aug. 31 but is likely to be extended. Germany currently has 130 soldiers in leadership and education roles
and as part of the UN’s Lebanese maritime mission to protect the
country’s sea borders and prevent arms smuggling. Some 81,000 ships have been inspected and 10,000 reported to Lebanese authorities since 2006.
