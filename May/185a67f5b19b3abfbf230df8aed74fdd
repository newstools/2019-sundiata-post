By Olanrewaju Akojede and Kemi Ajayi Lagos – The 1st Vice-President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Seyi Akinwunmi, on Tuesday in Lagos said that the body did not expect the Super Eagles to win the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) at all cost. Akinwunmi told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the Glass House
football administration would not put pressure on the Gernot
Rohr-tutored team but expect that the team should be at their best. NAN reports that the Super Eagles will begin their quest for their
fourth glory when the biennial football hostilities takes centre stage
in Egypt from June 21 to July 19. Akinwunmi, however, said that the team had been given enough
incentive that could aid their performance during the football fiesta in
Egypt. “What we have done so far as NFF is that we have put up a programme
where the footballers only have to think about football with no
extraneous matters. “So, we expect them to be at their best and do their best. They
should strive to win the Cup and if they didn’t win, that does not mean
that they have failed. “They can only be termed as failure if they failed to put in their
best and we can judge that with their performance. But sometimes efforts
are not enough. “Sometimes, circumstances may arise, then, we should know that they have tried, not to win at all cost,’’ he said. Akinwunmi urged Nigerians to support the team, adding that the
support would help the team to be at their best instead of putting
pressure on the team. “We expect Nigerians as before to support the team in all the ways
they can because that is what they need right now and not that they
should put pressure on the team. “I also know that Nigerians pray a lot, so I also expect that they
pray for the team to succeed in Egypt, those that are able to go and
those that will stay at home,’’ he said.
