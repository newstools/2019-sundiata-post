Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, formally vacated the State Government House on Tuesday. A gathering witnessed the lowering of the flag of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as he bade farewell. Speaking, Okorocha said he performed well in office. He said “I have not broken the law, I only bend to achieve results. I do things the other way and I get results. I remember in 2011 when darkness ravaged and people cannot go out for fear of being kidnapped but today Imo is a secured state. “So I can say that I came, I saw and I conquered. I am not here to make speeches on my achievements. I encourage you to support the new government in power. “The office of the governor is a seal covering people, it is like a mask covering me and if you remove that mask you will see the real Rochas that is bigger than the governor. Let those that are fighting stop as I leave the Government House today.” The governor was later escorted to his private residence in Owerri, the state capital.
