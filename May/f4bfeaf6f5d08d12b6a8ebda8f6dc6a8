By Chinyere Joel-Nwokeoma Lagos – Investors on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) on Friday reacted negatively to the reappointment of Mr Godwin Emefiele for second term as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor by President Muhammadu Buhari. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that contrary to market operators’ expectations, the crucial market indices maintained negative outlook for fifth consecutive days. Specifically, the market capitalization which opened at N10.860 trillion shed N20 billion to close at N10.840 trillion. In the same vein, the All-Share Index lost 48.44 points or 0.17 per cent to close at 28,847.81 against 28,896.25 recorded on Thursday. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., attributed the development to low liquidity and weak market fundamentals. “Equity segment of the financial market did not react positively to the reappointment of CBN governor due to prevailing low liquidity and weak market fundamental,” Omordion said. He said that fixed income segment witnessed bullish trading due to the positive news of the governor’s reappointment. Omordion said that the reappointment showed Buhari’s readiness and interest in reactivating the economy again. He noted that monetary stability was a key pointer to assure investors of continuality and stable exchange rate. Omordion said that Emefiele’s monetary policy supported the economy despite the deficit position of the government all these years. He said that financial market regulators should come together and help market makers to have access to cheap funds to boost activities in the stock market. Omordion noted that pension and the sovereign wealth funds should play more in the stock market to create liquidity.
