He is the billionaire whose house was claimed by blogger Blessing Okoro to be hers. Yesterday, a video surfaced on the internet showing the arrest of Blessing Okoro who had claimed ownership of Onye Ezeâ€™s house in Enugu. Although she claimed the matter has been resolved with the owner after it was revealed she posted photos of the house for clouts. Okoro Blessing in the audio admitted to faking the house, and she planned on waiting for a while for the whole saga to die down, before she builds a replica of the house so as to launder her own image online. The blogger was arrested earlier today, and forced to make a video to admit that the 7-Bedroom duplex she claimed to have built from scratch does not belong to her. Who is Onye Eze Money?
