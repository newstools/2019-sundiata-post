One day, the young men chasing ladies all around town will realize that it’s not about education, swagger, body structure, height or looks but the size of the pocket. Since 21-year old Nigerian actress Regina Daniels reportedly married a 59 year old billionaire, Ned Nwoko, historians have been looking into similar cases. Photos of Adams Oshiomhole, late Tony Anenih, Razak Okoya, Chief Emmanuel Iwanyanwu and other socialites and politicians who married women young enough to be their daughters and in some cases, grandchildren, have been dug out and shared online. This means the act of marrying for a better life didn’t start with Regina Daniels and it will not end with her. More young ladies will still marry much older men for better lives especially as the economy in Nigeria gets harder. Most of the ladies frolicking with elderly men have always claimed to be doing it for love but the society seems to disagree. The pictures here are presently being shared on Facebook for reference purposes. See photos: Source
