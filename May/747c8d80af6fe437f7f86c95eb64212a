By Shyam Kukadia Many have said Canada gives a red carpet welcoming to your immigration application, but it’s not easy finding a job. Is it worth going there?
Dear Friend, Yes, It’s More than Worth ! I am here in Canada and today I completed Successful 100 Days in Beautiful Canada ! I had same fear in my mind before coming to Canada and it’s Natural. Finding a Job is not easy, Agreed but it’s not easy anywhere. I don’t know from which country are you but I am from INDIA and I know it’s not easy there ! I know many Fresh MBAs and Engineers not able to find jobs. Also can you imagine to leave a job in INDIA or any other country and to find a better job very next day ? Not Possible Right ? Then how can you think to get a job Immediately in a new country like canada with: Different Work Culture,
Different Industry Regulations,
Different Language(French in many Jobs)
If you are planning to move to Canada that means you have already taken a Bold Decision and you are Motivated so take this as a challenge as if you had to leave your Job and country for some reason and you have to start from Zero ! Have Patience and keep believing in yourself, Finding a Job can be easy in Canada too. Source: Quora
