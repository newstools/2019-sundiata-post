By Chimezie Anaso Awka – Gov. Willie Obiano of Anambra has urged contractors handling road projects in the state to expedite action and deliver before the rainy season. Obiano made the call when he inspected the progress of work at Ekwulummili-Unubi, Nnewi South Local Government Area of the state. The road with a distance of 3.8km is the link between Ekwulummiri and Unubi communities but was cut-off for a long time. Obiano, who said the contractor had been mobilised, urged the company to be more aggressive in executing the job on the road before downpour begins. He disclosed that over 123 road projects sites were getting attention and would be asphalted before heavy rainfall. Obiano, who also inspected works at Mbaukwu, Umuawulu, Awgbu road, said his administration was determined to opening  up the hinterland and increasing their viability by linking them being agrarian communities. He said it was all in the bid of his administration to make the state food sufficient and provide necessary measures that would boost productivity. “These roads are important due to the nature of the communities around, they are agrarian communities. “The roads will enable them to send their agricultural produce to markets,” he said. The governor told the people of the benefiting communities to take ownership and protect every government property. He warned them against indiscriminate disposal of refuse, especially in the drainage. Contributing, Mr Marcel Ifejiofor, the Commissioner for Works in Anambra, said the 2.6km Mbaukwu, Umuawulu, Awgbu road would accommodate 25 metres long bridge with standard drainage that would stand the test of time.
