By Joy Kaka Abuja – A Kubwa Grade I Area Court on Wednesday dissolved a five-year-old marriage between Aisha Hussain and Dhikrullah Agberemi over infidelity and violence. The judge, Ibrahim Balarabe dissolved the marriage following
Hussain’s prayer for the court to confirm a divorce letter which was
given to her by Agberemi on April 17, which he had admitted to. The court  ordered that the divorce takes effect from the said date. Balarabe also ordered the petitioner, to wait for three months cycle before contracting another marriage. He also ordered that the four-year-old daughter should bear the
respondent’s name and must not be taken outside the country without the
consent of her father. ”The respondent must be allowed to see his daughter every first Saturday and Sunday monthly from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. ”The petitioner is allowed to process a certificate of divorce from the court after payment of prescribed fee,” he ordered. NAN reports that the petitioner got married to the respondent on May 3, 2014 in Ilorin, Kwara under Islamic Personal Law. In March 2015, the petitioner said she discovered text messages sent
to the respondent by his girlfriend  and he confessed to cheating and
begged for forgiveness when he was confronted. Hussain also said the respondent developed a habit of constantly
abusing her verbally and physically by beating her which led to her
leaving her matrimonial home on December, 2016. The respondent and petitioner had been staying separately since then
which resulted to the petitioner filing for divorce on March 14, on
grounds of lack of interest in the marriage, unfaithfulness and
violence.
