Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, on Wednesday boasted that the state would not have a governor like him even in the next 50 years. Okorocha has been in legal battle with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for his certificate of return as senator-elect of Imo West. The governor, at the commissioning of the new Justice Chukwudifu Akunne Oputa High Court Complex in new Owerri, said that he came in as governor through the masses and not with the elites’ help. “I came in through the window of the masses and not through the doors of the elite and I am crazy in my vision and passion for a greater Imo State and nothing has affected my oblongata,” he said. “Let my works speak for me after leaving office and I am not in the business of wasting the tax payers’ money to commission projects because I believe that such fund should be channeled to other productive ventures. “My crazy system of governance is working and no governor coming after me will ever think of building hospitals in Imo for the next 50 years or to build more universities.” Okorocha also hailed the late Justice Chukwudifu Oputa as one of the nation’s greatest patriots. He also promised to pay arrears owed to judges in the state before handing over on May 29. Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Tanko Muhammad, who commissioned the project through Justice Amina Augie, commended Okorocha for erecting the structure. Source : qed.ng
