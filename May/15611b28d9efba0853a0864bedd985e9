In one of Tonto Dikeh’s recent interviews, she alleged that her ex-husband, Olakunle Churchill, doesn’t last in bed more than 40 seconds. According to the controversial Nigerian actress, the only time Mr Olakunle lasted up to one minute in bed, was the time they conceived her son. Churchill has not entirely remained mute ever since Tonto’s explosive interview. He has been sending some subliminal shots to Tonto but this new one seems to be the most direct one. In flaunting a new car he purchased on Instagram, Mr Olankule wrote: “they can’t stop a moving train” and added the hashtags #thestruggleisrealtho #everything40 #makingmoneyin40secs. However, Tonto’s baby daddy later edited the caption to do away with the shade but not before the screenshot below was taken. Source
