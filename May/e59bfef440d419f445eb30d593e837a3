Jessica Cox is one sweet inspirational woman that has defied all odds set before her, right from childhood to become a champion and jinx breaker. She was born in Phoenix on the 2nd of February 1983 without arms for no medical reason and when family and friends worried over how she would cope in this hostile world, she proved that impossible is nothing. Apart from graduating from the university with a degree in psychology and a minor in communications, Jessica has defied all odds to become a great inspiration to many people in the world. Interestingly, she’s a licensed pilot. Born without hands, you might wonder how she will survive and do most of her chores. But, this amazingly gorgeous woman does all basic things a man or woman born with arms can do and even better. She uses her feet to do basically what any hand can do. With her feet, she can type on a keyboard, drive, scuba dive, fly a plane, play piano, surf and do virtually anything you can think of. In fact, she currently holds the Guinness world record as the world’s first licensed armless pilot. She’s also the first armless black-belt holder in the American Taekwondo Association. “It was a long journey to become a pilot because it took three different airplanes, not because I wrecked them, but the logistics of the control panel were challenging for me,” Cox noted about her challenges in trying to fly a plane. She has used her story to motivate many others, sharing her message of hope in about 20 different countries. She also does humanitarian works. She has an autobiographical self-help book, ‘Disarm Your Limits’ in which she shared the story of her journey so far. Cox is one woman who has shown that giving up is not in her DNA. What a phenomenal woman!
