By Naomi Sharang Abuja, May 16, 2019 (NAN) The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says
it has apprehended no fewer than 3, 000 offenders in the last 14 months
in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) for using phones while driving. The corps’ Public Education Officer (PRO), Mr Bisi Kazeem, disclosed
this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, on Thursday. Kazeem described the trend as a serious offence in driving which the FRSC always frowned at. He said, “This bad driving behaviour has over the years led to
several crashes that have resulted in wanton loss of lives and even
permanent disabilities in some instances. “Due to this, it has been categorised among the most critical offences the corps is presently waging war against. “This brings about the creation of the COBRA Special Unit by the
Corps Marshal and the introduction of the Emotional Stability Test for
drivers arrested using their phones while driving.” He explained that the enforcement policy which was systematically
fashioned out to put an end to the killer-driving behaviour resulted in
the arrest of the 3, 000 offenders in the FCT. Kazeem further said that from July 2017 to May 2019, FRSC patrol
teams apprehended and referred 4, 914 offenders to various government
medical facilities for psychological medical evaluation. “Out of these referrals, a total of 85 offenders tested positive. “It is actually a herculean task enforcing compliance with traffic
rules. But the corps is up to the task and we are facing the challenge
head-on. “The FRSC personnel have been motivated and are 100 per cent
committed to the task of ensuring that motorists comply with the
directive on no use of phone while driving,” he said. The PRO said that the corps optimistic that in the near future,
Nigerians would learn to appreciate the laws of the land and comply with
the provisions at all times.
