A 24-year old Ghanaian lady identified as Akua has revealed that she slept with 600 men in a year during her days as a prostitute. According to the Ghanaian lady, she opted for prostitution so as to survive the harsh economy in the country. She said she started facing the harshness of the economy when her jealous friends made her boyfriend who was sponsoring her to dump her. “My boyfriend whom I met when I went to visit an uncle who was sponsoring my education. We had agreed to get married as soon as possible. Then some people I regarded as friends started peddling wicked lies against me and without confirming if what they were saying was true or false, he called it quits just like that. “They told him I had an incurable disease. So, I decided to help myself because my parents cannot do anything for me. We are poor. My father used to be a driver but he is now unemployed while my mother is a full time housewife. Sometimes, she sells vegetables”, Akua narrated. On the amount she was earning working as a prostitute during at night, she said: “They were paying me GH¢150 a month and you work late hours. But if you go out to hustle in the night, you can get that kind of money within a day or two. About 600 men slept with me from last year to this year,” she revealed. Source: tori.ng
