In Zamfara, the party had what it considered a clean sweep but on Friday, the highest court in the land awarded the ruling party’s votes to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The cause of this massive loss by the party could be traced to internal crisis that prevented it from holding primary elections. In all, APC lost seven house of representatives seats, three senatorial positions, 24 house of assembly seats, and governorship. Below is a full list of those affected by the ruling: SENATE Tijjani Yahaya, Zamfara north
Aliyu Bilbis, Zamfara central
Abdulaziz Yari, Zamfara west
