Davido shared a picture of his girlfriend, Chioma and expressed his undying love for her. “Your Body Dey Blow My Mind,” was his romantic comment. It would be recalled that Chioma allegedly dropped out of Babcock University to focus on her romance with Davido. Despite the views of cynics, the relationship has continued to wax stronger. Davido presently has two children with two different women with another lady based in Ibadan trying hard to join the list of his babymamas. Source: tori.ng
