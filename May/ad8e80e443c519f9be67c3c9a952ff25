By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The erstwhile Minister of Communication, Adebayo Shittu has joined the Deputy National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Senator Lawal Shuaibu to call for the resignation of the National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Recall that Shittu was disqualified by the Oshiomhole led National Working Committee from contesting the party’s governorship primaries in Oyo state. Shittu made the call while reacting to the letter written to Oshiomhole by the Deputy National Chairman, North, Senator Lawal Shuaibu accusing him of altering decisions of the National Working Committee among others and asking him to take the most honourable part and resign his position. Shittu said “I endorse it. The truth is that with Oshiomhole, this party would go down by the time President Muhammadu Buhari finishes. Oshiomhole is full of himself and he has an ego problem and he wants to dominate every environment and democracy is not like that. “I know that many of us who are conscionable members of the party who think of the future of this party and the fact that this party should continue to be relevant even after President Muhammad Buhari has left office. We are concerned and everything that we can do to force him out, we will do it.’” Further recall that the Deputy National Chairman of the APC, Senator Lawal Shuaibu had, shortly after Supreme Court nullified the victory of Zamfara chapter of the party, called for the resignation of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. According to Shuaibu, Oshiomhole lacked the competence to pioneer the affairs of the party. Culled from Vanguard.
