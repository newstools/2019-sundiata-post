By Sandra UmehLagos, â€“ For trafficking in 1.4 kg of Cannabis Sativa, also known as hemp, a Federal High Court in Lagos, has sentenced a 35-year-old man, Samuel Shilon, to one year imprisonment. Shilon, who is unemployed, was brought by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), before Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke, on a one-count charge of drug trafficking. He pleaded guilty to the charge. Consequent upon his guilty plea, the Prosecutor, Mr Jeremiah Aernan, reviewed the facts of the case before the court and tendered several exhibits in evidence. They include a certificate of test analysis, packaging of substance form, the bulk of drug exhibit, a request for scientific aid form, the statement of the defendant, a drug analysis form and a remnant of the restricted substance. The court accordingly, marked the exhibits. Aernan urged the court to convict the defendant based on his plea and evidences adduced. In his judgment, Justice Aneke found the defendant guilty of the offence as charged and convicted him. The court accordingly, sentenced him to a term of one year imprisonment, beginning from the date of his arrest. According to the charge, the convict was arrested on Feb.12, in the Ijesha area of Lagos, with the narcotic measuring 1.4kg. According to the NDLEA, hemp is a restricted narcotic similar to cocaine and heroine LSD, which are all restricted by the provisions of the law. The offence contravenes the provisions of Section 11 (c) of the NDLEA Act, Cap. N30, Laws of the Federation, 2004. Before his sentence, the convict made a plea before the court, urging it to be lenient in its judgment
