By Chris Ebbert None of the countries I have lived in were entirely like I expected before I went: Germany: far lower integrity than one might expect; Austria: they only sound charming when you visit; Canada: fewer opportunities than I thought; USA: less enlightened than I thought; France: less light hearted than I thought; Great Britain: far more violent than I thought; New Zealand: much less friendly than I thought; China: much more comfortable than I thought; India: much more materialistic than I thought; Sweden: actually just like I thought – which I hadn’t expected.
