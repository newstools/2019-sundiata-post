He said there is a deliberate attempt by some elders of the family to cover up the murder of their sister but they won’t sit aloof for that to happen. Speaking in an interview with Adom News, master Atta, who stated they do not know the basis of the elders’ decision, called for the arrest of the deceased’s fiance. “We won’t agree to the decision of the elders because this is a criminal issue so he must face the law for his actions because this is not the first time he has beaten her. “Some of the family members have approached us to meet with the accused to settle the issue at home but we see it beyond home settlements we won’t agree,” he said. Miss Bronya was allegedly assaulted by her boyfriend, a drinking spot operator till she fell unconscious and was rushed to the hospital but died few days after she was discharged from the hospital.
