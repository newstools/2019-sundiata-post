By Adaeze Iroha Lagos – A 22-year-old houseboy, Micheal Adoun, who allegedly robbed his former employer of his Samsung phone, has been remanded in prison custody in Lagos. The chief magistrate, Oluwatoyin Ojuromi, gave this order on Friday at a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. Adoun, a resident of Ipaja area of Lagos, is facing one count charge of robbery. The police prosecutor, Sgt. Godwin Oriabure, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on May 10 at No. 6, Olomoroti Jayesimi street, Gbagada estate, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant had been in the employment of the complainant, Mr Adebayo Muili, as his houseboy for three years prior to the robbery. Muili, the prosecutor said, had sacked the defendant just a few days before because he was caught stealing money from him. Oriabure further told the court that the defendant came back to the house that day with a knife to rob the complainant. “My lord, Adoun stole the complainant’s Samsung phone valued  N150,000 from him while threatening to stab him with the knife he was holding. “He covered his face with a shirt but on his way out, the estate security men were able to apprehend him. “It was when he was caught that the complainant identified him as his former houseboy and the phone was recovered from him,” he said. Ojuromi ordered the defendant to be remanded in Kirikiri prison custody pending legal advice from the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecution and adjourned the case to June 14. The offence contravened Section 297 (2) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 297(2) stipulates a death sentence for the offence of armed robbery.
