By Edith Nwapi Abuja – The Borno National and State Houses of Assembly elections petition tribunal sitting in Nyanya, fixed May 9 for pre- hearing in a petition filed by Bukar Shuwa, of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Shuwa is challenging the declaration of Alhaji Ahmed Satomi of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as winner of the election into the Jere Federal Constituency of Borno held on Feb. 23, The APC and INEC are also joined in the suit. Mr Mike David, Secretary of the tribunal, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the tribunal, presided over by Justice Peter Kekemeke, fixed the date, for the pre-hearing after the respondents replied to the petition and filed relevant processes. In the petition dated March 15, with number, EPT/BO/HR/4/2019 and made available to NAN, Shuwa averred that the election was marred by irregularities and substantial non-compliance with provisions of the Electoral Act. He therefore sought the declaration of the tribunal for INEC to withdraw Satomi’s Certificate of Return and to conduct fresh election for the seat of Jere Federal Constituency. Satomi averred in his reply dated April, 29 made available to NAN, that the petitioners call for cancellation of the election is unconscionable and borne out of desire to truncate the franchise freely exercised by the electorate. He denied the petitioners’ allegations of connivance with INEC (3rd respondent) and put the petitioners to a strict proof of the allegations. Satomi further averred that he would rely on relevant documents to prove his points. He therefore urged the tribunal to dismiss the petition in its entirety for being frivolous, vexatious, unconscionable, gold digging and lacking on merit. NAN reports that this is the second petition for pre- hearing out of seven received by the tribunal.
