Canberra – A man has been arrested after 20 kilogrammes of the drug methylamphetamine was delivered via mail to a wrong address, Police said on Thursday. The parcel, worth an estimated $7 million, was sent to an elderly
couple, who were shocked when they opened the delivery on Wednesday in
Werribee, a south-western suburb of Melbourne. Victoria Police said they were called after the couple discovered the
package contained bags of white powder, which officers later identified
as methylamphetamine, also known as meth or ice. Detectives raided a property 60 kilometres away in Bundoora, a
northern suburb of Melbourne and allegedly found another 20 kilogrammes
of the drug. A 21-year-old man was arrested at the scene and later charged with importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug. He was due to appear at the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court on Thursday.
