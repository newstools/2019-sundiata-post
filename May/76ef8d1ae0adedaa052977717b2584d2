A final year student of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, UNN Chukwuemeka Akachi, has committed suicide after dropping a suicide note on Facebook. The final year student of English and Literary studies had been been having a long battle with mental health. His suicide note on Facebook reads: Suicide Note. Forgive me. In case you are the one who found the body, I am really sorry. It had to be someone, you know. I have chosen Jo Nketaih’s poem as my suicide note: “They said you came looking for me. I didn’t drown; I was the water.” Where do atheists go to when they die? lol. Amen. Akachi died yesterday, after leaving a suicide note and revealing his long battle with mental health on Facebook. In one of his previous posts on Facebook, he wrote on his battle with mental health and how it has affected his growth: My mental health has been on life support for a while now. Thanks to those who call. Text. Visit. Speak to me. May we always remember. May we never forget. You may have added a few hours, months or days to my time here. But you know life support is expensive right? Thanks for trying. Amen. According to one of his friends, Akachi consumed two bottles of a poisonous substance and it was the second time he would be attempting suicide in recent times. Source
