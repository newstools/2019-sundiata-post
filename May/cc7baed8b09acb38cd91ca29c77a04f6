By Ronke Asagun Lokoja, – The Wife of Kogi Governor, Mrs Rashida Bello, has advised Muslims in the state to promote peace, religious tolerance and love for mankind, irrespective of religious belief and ethnic diversity during Ramadan. She gave the advice in her Ramadan message to Muslims through her
Special Assistant, Media, Mrs Olamide Adesoro, in Lokoja on Monday. “Ramadan being a time for spiritual reflection, improvement,
increased devotion and worship, Muslims should use the period to renew
solidarity and cultivate positive relationship with God, family and the
society. “Ramadan is the month that the Almighty Allah opens his doors of
mercy, forgiveness and blessings upon Muslims, hence the need for them
to show love, peaceful co-existence, forgiveness to one another. “Ramadan also teaches Muslims how to better practice self-discipline,
self-control, sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate;
thus encouraging actions of generosity and charity,’’ Mrs Bello said. She called on Muslims and the entire people of Kogi State to use the
Ramadan period to pray for peace, successful conduct of Nov. 2
Governorship election and overall development of the state. Mrs Bello urged the people of other faiths to encourage their
brothers and sisters, who are fasting, saying that the month is holy and
should be regarded as the  season of cleansing sins. She welcomed the Muslim faithful to the season and prayed to Allah to give them strength during the Ramadan period.
