Manila – The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Thursday said it would provide its largest infrastructure financing to the Philippines to help fund the construction of a 53-kilometre passenger railway system north of the capital. The Manila-based bank said that the financial package of up to 2.75
billion dollars would help build two rail segments connecting an
existing overhead train system in Manila to the Clark economic zone via
the city of Malolos in Bulacan, north of the capital. “It will be ADB’s single largest infrastructure project financing ever,” Bank President, Takehiko Nakao, said. “The project, combined with other investments in light rail transit,
metro rail transit, and subway systems, will bring back the culture of
rail transport in Metro Manila,” he added. The Malolos-Clark project is part of a plan by the Philippine
government to build a 163-kilometre train network that connects towns
north of Manila to those located south of the capital. The project is expected to be completed by 2025. The Malolos-Clark railway project alone would provide public
transport to about 342,000 passengers, who travel daily between Manila
and Clark, and cut travel time to less than one hour by rail compared to
up to three hours by car or bus. Once the full network is completed by 2025, it would benefit up to
696,000 passengers per day from the southern city of Calamba, the ADB
said. The project would help ease congestion in Manila, reduce air
pollution, cut costs for transport and logistics as well as spur
economic growth in the central part of the northern region of Luzon, the
bank added.
