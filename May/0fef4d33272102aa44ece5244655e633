Residents of Enugu state have now devised another means of punishing thieves after they whipped a thief, served him food before making him clear dirty gutter in Enugu. According to Richard Blackstone who shared the story on Facebook, the thief was given a different kind of treatment after the residents resisted the urge to implement jungle justice on his matter. He wrote; “This muscled guy was caught stealing in enugu , He was whipped small. Afterwards, we bought food for him, gave him two bottles of fanta drinks to quench his thirst and supplied him with one bag of sachet water. He was then given a shovel to desilt the big gutter leading to my poultry farm road in enugu, What a beautiful thing. He doesn’t need to go to jail. I think this is better than killing them or jail, let’s use them to keep our country clean.” Source
