Former aide to ex- president Goodluck Jonathan in his characteristic manner decided to trigger the literary side of Nigeria Twitter today. According to him, he feels that late literary icon, Chinua Achebe is more deserving of the Nobel Laureate Award won by fellow country man Wole Soyinka. See his tweet below: “Between Chinua Achebe and Professor Wole Soyinka, I would give the @NobelPrize for literature to Achebe 100 times out of 100 times. I still don’t understand how Soyinka got it and Achebe did not. I read their books. Achebe’s works are by far the more superior works of literature.” Reactions followed immediately with contrary and consenting opinions here and there. The debate about who is more deserving of the award is not new. It is an equivalent of Messi vs Ronaldo debates. It is unlikely to end. See reactions below:
