Berlin – German Chancellor Angela Merkel has invited Britain’s Prince Charles and his wife Camilla to see her in her Berlin office when they visit next week, a government spokeswoman said in Berlin on Friday. Asked whether the invitation was part of a charm offensive during the
protracted and difficult Brexit talks, Ulrike Demmer said she was
disinclined to place any interpretation on the royal visit. “We’re looking forward to the visit and you know how important
Britain is to us as a partner at the time of Brexit negotiations as
well,” Demmer said. Charles and Camilla plan to be in Germany from Tuesday to Friday next week. During a trip to the eastern city of Leipzig, they will hear how a
“peaceful revolution” that ended the division of Germany in 1989 came
about. In Munich the theme will move to climate-friendly economic growth and cooperation between the two countries.
