Nigerian actress, Daniella Okeke, 32, has hinted that no amount of s*xual pleasure will prevent an unfaithful man from cheating. According to the curvy lady, Daniella Okeke, women need to stop going overboard sexually just so they can keep a man that does not want to be kept. Daniella stated in her post that no matter the s*x position a woman offers to her man, if he is going to cheat, he will do just that. She added that women need not cause themselves spinal cord injuries just so they can make a man committed to them. Her post was well received by many as well. Toke Makinwa and Tonto Dikeh obviously approved of her message as they liked and commented on the post.
