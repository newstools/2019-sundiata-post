Beijing – China Air Transport Association (CATA) on Friday said it estimated losses at Chinese airlines caused by the grounding of Boeing Co’s 737 MAX aircraft would reach around 4 billion Yuan (579.32 million dollars) by the end of June. China was the first country to ground the 737 MAX two months ago
after a crash in Ethiopia killed 157 people in March, in the second such
incident for Boeing’s newest aircraft. “The U.S. air regulator expects approval for the plane to return to
service as early as late June,’’ sources told Reuters on Thursday. Earlier this week, China’s biggest airlines formally asked U.S.
planemaker Boeing to compensate them for losses caused by the grounding
and delayed deliveries of 737 MAX jets. “We sincerely hope Boeing will place great importance to the
compensation requests made by our member companies and offer solutions
in a reasonable and legal manner,” CATA said in a statement on its
website. The association represents 41 Chinese airlines including compensation
claimants Air China Ltd, China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd, and China
Southern Airlines Co Ltd. “We will closely monitor developments and provide proactive and
necessary assistance upon request from our member companies, to
safeguard their legitimate and lawful rights and interests. “Chinese airlines had 96 737 MAX jets in operation before the
grounding and were due to receive delivery of over 130 more this year. “As time passes, associated losses will further increase,’’ CATA said.
