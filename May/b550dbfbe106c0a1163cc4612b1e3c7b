Niger,  spoke to the chancellor on migration, terrorism, organised
crime, mobile border security and drugs trafficking. The mission, currently numbering 120 EU and 60 local personnel, was
set up by the EU in 2012 to respond to train the Niger police and other
security officials to fight terrorism and organised crime in the region. Before flying back to Berlin, Merkel was to visit a women’s rights
