One of them was hidden behind the rear seats and the other two were in the dashboard.Two of the three had to be stabilised by medics after showing symptoms of asphyxia, disorientation and generalised pain in the joints due to the way in which they had been travelling. They were discovered in Beni-Enzar and Melilla (Picture: Guardia Civil)A fourth truck was then searched in the Spanish port of Melilla, and officials found a 20-year-old man in the base of the vehicle.
