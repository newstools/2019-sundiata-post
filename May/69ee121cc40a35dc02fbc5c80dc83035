estranged husband divorced her four months ago with two male children. “When I gave birth to our second child, he did not buy anything for
the child, my parents bought me eight pieces of wrappers which he sold
and used the money for his personal use. “Few months after I gave birth, he divorced me. I went to his house and packed all my belongings. “When I went for the second time to pack the rest of my belongings, I did not see my mattress”, Muhammad told the court. The defendant, Salisu Ismail, also a tailor, whose address was not

went to the house to get her belongings. “When I came back home from work , I discovered that she went away
with my chairs. I went and complained to her parents and demanded for my
furniture back. “Her parents told me that their daughter said I sold all the wrappers
they bought for her when she gave birth to our last child. I left and
never went back again,’’ Ismail said. The Judge, Dahiru lawal, confirmed the divorce and ordered the defendant to give the complainant her mattress back by May 13. The Judge also ordered the defendant to pay N5, 000 monthly, for the upkeep of their child in his ex-wife’s custody.
