Beijing – Chinese trade delegates are still preparing for negotiations in Washington starting on Wednesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday. Chinese trade delegates are preparing, despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods by Friday. China “still hopes’’ it can work together with the United States to
achieve a “win-win agreement,’’ Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang
said during a news conference on Monday. “Regarding the next round of economic and trade consultations, we are
still gathering information about the situation,’’ Geng said. “I can
tell you the Chinese team is preparing to go to the U.S. for
negotiations.’’ On Sunday, Trump said that tariffs on 200 billion dollars’ worth of
Chinese goods will rise from 10 to 25 per cent on Friday, stating that
trade negotiations were moving “too slowly.’’ The announcement rattled markets and reportedly took Chinese
officials by surprise as there had been discussions about the two sides
reaching a trade deal by the end of the week. Chinese shares tumbled following the announcement, with the benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index diving 5.58 per cent by the end of Monday’s
trading session.
