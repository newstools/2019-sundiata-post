By Usman Aliyu Ilorin – Ahead of the May 29 hand over to the incoming government in Kwara, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Oluwafemi Yusuf, has accused the outgoing administration of indulging in “indiscriminate looting of government property.” Yusuf, while speaking with newsmen on Wednesday in Ilorin, said that
the party had been inundated with the indiscriminate manner in which
officials of the state government were allegedly moving government
belongings out of Government House to unknown destinations. The APC stalwart also accused the outgoing government of offering
employment to about 2,000 people in local and state government services
at the twilight of its tenure in the bid to set booby traps for the new
government. He, however, warned the government officials to halt the alleged
looting spree of government property forthwith, saying that the people
would not condone this. Yusuf similarly accused the outgoing government of constituting the
boards of certain commissions and agencies in the state as part of its
plot to frustrate the new government. The APC chieftain, who hails from Ifelodun Local Government Area of
the state, urged the people  to resist any plot to subject Kwara to
chaos ahead of the inauguration of the new government. The state government had, however, denied the allegation that it was moving government property out of the Government House. A statement by Dr Muideen Akorede, the governor’s media aide, had
insisted that the truck that was seen coming out of the Government House
only conveyed food items donated to the state by the Dangote Foundation
for Ramadan.
