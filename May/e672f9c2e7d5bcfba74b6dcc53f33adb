Barely a few hours after being passed by the Kano State House of Assembly, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has assented the bill seeking the establishment of four additional first class Emirates in Kano State. The bill, observers say, is targeted at the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, whose power and influence Ganduje wants to whittle down. The House at noon on Wednesday passed the bill for the creation of four additional first class Emirates to be situated in Rano, Gaya, Karaya and Bichi. This follows the approval of the amendment of the local government and chieftaincy affairs law by the lawmakers, during their sitting on Wednesday. In a motion presented to the House by the Majority Leader Baffa Babba, the House unanimously agreed that creation of more Emirates will assist in job creation, dispute, and community conflict resolutions among others. The passage of this bill paves way for the decentralisation of the Kano Emirate council thereby decentralising the power of Emir of Kano. Source: channelstv
