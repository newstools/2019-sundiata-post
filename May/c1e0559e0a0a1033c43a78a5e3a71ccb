By Nana Musa Abuja – A Karmo Grade I Area Court on Thursday, discharged a 20-year-old scavenger, Abdulsalam Isiaka, accused of stealing a wall light. Isiaka, who resides at Jabi Park, Abuja, had pleaded guilty to the
offence but begged for leniency, claiming that he didn’t know what
pushed him to committing the crime. The Judge, Mr Inuwa Maiwada, warned and discharged him. Maiwada ordered him to stay away from committing crime in the future. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Ijeoma Ukagha, had told the court that one
Josana Alabi of Utako, Abuja, reported the matter at the Utako Police
Station, on May 6. Ukagha alleged that the defendant had on that same date gone into the
complainant’s apartment and stole his wall bracket light valued at N8,
000, but was caught in the act and the item recovered from him. He said that the offence contravened the provisions of Section 288 of the Penal Code.
