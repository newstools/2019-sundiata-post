By Deborah Akpede Ikeja, – A 25-year-old unemployed man, Moses Ikechukwu, charged with robbing a passenger of his two phones, was on Wednesday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. The defendant, whose residential address is not known, was arraigned
before Magistrate O.O. Ekundayo on a two-count charge of conspiracy, and
stealing. Ikechukwu, however, denied committing the offences and was admitted to a bail of N100, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Ekundayo said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show
evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Police Prosecutor, Insp. Josephine Ikhayere told the court that the
defendant committed the offences on April 8, at Apapa, Lagos. She said that the defendant and others still at large conspired to
dispossess Mr Romamis Ekwo of his two phones, valued at N80, 000. Ikhayere said that the complainant boarded the bus, but on the way,
the defendant and five others pretending to be passengers stopped the
bus and dispossessed him of his phones. “The defendant stopped the bus, rushed in and attacked the complainant with dangerous weapons. “They threatened to harm him with those knives, bottles and iron rods
if he refused to comply; for fear of the unknown, the complainant
surrendered his two phones. “On sighting the police in front, they jumped down from the vehicle and ran away. “The complainant raised alarm; the defendant was arrested while others escaped with the phones,” the prosecutor said. The offences violated Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 stipulates
three-years imprisonment for stealing while section 411 prescribes two
years for conspiracy. The case was adjourned until June 3, for mention.
