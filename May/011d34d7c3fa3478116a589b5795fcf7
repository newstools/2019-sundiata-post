After betting one million naira during last night’s clash between Barcelona and Liverpool, a musician’s heart has been shattered Nigerian singer, Kcee has lost one million Naira (N1,000,000) he staked during Liverpool vs Barcelona match. The musician had tipped Barcelona to win the match but, it turned out the other way. Kcee had promised on social media to give 1million naira to his friend, @mrchidozie (a die hard Liverpool fan) if Barca wins. Argentine star, Lionel Messi was excellent on the night of the first leg as he completed a brace with a superb free-kick. However, on the return leg, he was a shadow of himself as Liverpool rained goals on Barcelona at Anfield. The brilliance of the English Premier League side ensured Messi got denied the chance to play in a fourth UEFA Champions League final. He had earlier been predicted to reach the final and eventually win the trophy. As it turns out, Barcelona lost and Liverpool won. Shortly after the game, @mrchidozie confirmed receipt of the sum of One million naira which he won from the singer as a result of the bet. See screentshots below: Source
