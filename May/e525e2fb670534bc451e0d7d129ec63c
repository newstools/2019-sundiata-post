The Kano State House of Assembly has approved the amendment of the local government and chieftaincy affairs law, paving way for the decentralisation of the Kano emirate council. The law will now allow for the creation of four more first class emirs in the state, which include Rano, Karaye, Bichi and Gaya emirates. The Kano Assembly amended the law following a petition filled before the house by one Ibrahim Chambers. The petitioner demanded the upgrade of some traditional rulers to the status of first class emirs. If signed into law by Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of the state, it will whittle down the influence of Muhammadu Sanusi, emir of Kano. Details Laterâ€¦
