The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has likened the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) with the Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the Afenifere socio-cultural groups. While appearing as a guest on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily on Tuesday, he said the group isn’t linked to banditry activities. “The Miyetti Allah group is like Ohanaeze Ndigbo or the Afenifere. It’s just a cultural group,” he said. But the former minister of aviation and PDP chieftain has reacted to that statement. Read his statement below: “No they are not. They are an association of butchers of cows and men. They are the purveyors of violence, the custodians of falsehood and the repositories of evil. They are as perfidious as they are dangerous! They are an umbrella organisation of dark, callous, bloodthirsty and merciless men that seek to legitimise, shield and protect the Fulani herdsmen, the fourth most deadly terrorist organisation in the world. Comparing them to Afenifere or Ohaneze is like comparing the Church of Satan and the Cosa Nostra to the Vatican and the Anglican Communion”
