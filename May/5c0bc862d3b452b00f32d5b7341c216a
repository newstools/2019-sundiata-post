Many say it is a case of kettle calling pot black! Nollywood actress, Charity Nnaji, who was shamed for begging money from flamboyant Nigerian man, Mompha, has called out Blessing Okoro for lying. Recall that Okoro Blessing was also shamed by China-based businessman, Onye Eze for claiming that the his house belongs to her. She was dragged, mocked, handcuffed and shamed by the owner over her dishonesty. However, Nnaji while writing on her Instagram page slammed Okoro Blessing saying that she works hard for her money and has gone through a lot to get to where she is now. She also told her fans that they might be better than the celebrities they see on social media. She wrote: “I work hard for my money and I have gone through a lot to get to where am today…SAY NO TO FAKE LIFESTYLE… BE CONTENTED. don’t be influenced. don’t be deceived by what is going on, on social media. you might be better than all these celebrities you see on social media. when you go close to them, you will discover what I’m talking about..#okoroblessing hope you’ve leant your lesson.” However, many have told Nnaji to mind her own business as she is not better than Okoro. Recall that, few months ago, Mompha who is based in Dubai had shamed actress Charity Nnaji for calling him stingy because he refused giving her money she begged for. Mompha who shared a screenshot of his DM showing where actress, Nnaji Charity slid into his DM to beg for money, stated that some people are ‘born to be online beggars’. However Charity Nnaji who reacted to this via Instagram after turning off the comment section of her page, wrote; “I can never go offline because of this rubbish,,and this cannot change my passion either.” Source: tori.ng
