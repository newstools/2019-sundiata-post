Athens â€“ Some 190 migrants have been intercepted in the eastern Mediterranean since on Sunday, the Greek coastguard said on Monday. The migrants, who were trying to sail from Turkey to Greece, included 163 picked up by the coastguard near the islands of Samos and Kos, as well as 26 who were intercepted near the northern Greek port of Alexandroupoli. According to statistics that the Migration Ministry published, registration centres on Greek islands including Samos and Lesbos are overcrowded. However, the current inflow is significantly lower than during the peak of arrivals in 2015, when there were some days when 7,000 migrants were departing from the Turkish coast. (dpa/NAN)
