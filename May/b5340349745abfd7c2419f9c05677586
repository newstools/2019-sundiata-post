Tel Aviv –  The Israeli army announced Thursday it had destroyed the last Hezbollah “cross-border attack tunnel” that it had found dug from Lebanon into Israel. The tunnel had been dug from the village of Ramiyeh in Southern Lebanon into Israel and was discovered in January, the army said. “Hezbollah planned to infiltrate Israel through the attack tunnel, into Israeli communities near the border, in order to harm civilians as part of its war plans,” the army said in a statement. The army said it destroyed the portion of the tunnel in Lebanese territory and rendered the entire structure useless by pumping sealants into the rest of it. Last month, UN peacekeepers in Lebanon confirmed that three tunnels were found crossing into Israel. The UN peacekeeping mission, known as UNIFIL, monitors the situation at the border between Israel and Lebanon. The three tunnels violate a UN Security Council resolution that ended a 2006 war between Lebanon and Israel, according to UNIFIL. The destruction of the tunnel marks the completion of “Operation Northern Shield,” which began on Dec. 4, with the stated aim of exposing and neutralizing the tunnels, which Israel has decried as a violation of its sovereignty.
