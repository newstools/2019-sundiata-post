By Vivian Ibobo Ikeja – An applicant, Jennifer Anyabolu, 24, on Thursday appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly obtaining N1.866 million under the guise of securing a Singapore visa for a man. Anyabolu, who resides at No. 61, Adetola St., Aguda in Lagos, is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, fraud and stealing. She, however, pleaded not guilty. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Ishola Samuel, told the court that Anyabolu, with two others now at large, committed the offences on May 23, in Ikeja. Samuel said that the defendant obtained N1.866 million from the complainant, Mr Tochukwu Nwaeogu, under the pretext of securing the Singapore visa for him. The prosecutor said the defendant told the complainant that her elder sister based in Singapore had connection that could help him secure the visa. Samuel alleged that Anyabolu, who did not secure the visa, intentionally swindled the complainant and failed to refund the money. According to him, the offences contravened Sections 287, 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Magistrate, Mrs I. A. Abina, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Abina said that the sureties must be gainfully employed, and must show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She adjourned the case until June 26, for mention.
