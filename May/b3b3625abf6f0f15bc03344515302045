By Yakubu Uba Yola, – An Upper Area Court in Yola has remanded a middle-aged man, Umar Bello, in prison for attempting to rape a five- year-old-girl. The Police Prosecutor, Sgt. Ibrahim Aliyu, told the court that the
police received a report on April 24, that the defendant lured the
five-year-old girl into an uncompleted building and attempted to have
canal knowledge of her. Aliyu said the defendant’s action was an attempt to commit the offence of rape, which contravenes Section 95 of the Penal Code. When the charge was read to Bello, he pleaded guilty and begged for leniency. “I took the girl to the building with the intention to use her, but I
didn’t do it. I changed my mind when I realised that it is a bad thing
to do,’’ Bello pleaded. The prosecutor requested for time to conclude investigation on the matter. The Presiding Judge, Justice Umar Isa, who directed that the accused
be remanded in custody, adjourned the case to May 15, for commencement
of hearing.
