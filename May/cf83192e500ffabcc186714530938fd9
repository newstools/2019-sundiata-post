In those days, the society believed it owed every child a duty to make him/her become a better person. But today, we create the impression in our children that society STARTS and ENDS with their immediate families. Even when you knew someone was absolutely in order in castigating your child, chances are that you will still take offence. I mean even when you knew what the child did was totally wrong. The castigation does not have to be physical (caning) but just verbal reprimand. We limit the world of our kids to believe that the idea of morality is all about what we “teach” them. What we have is a society that has become so INDIVIDUALISTIC. Even when you knew the right thing to do to guide a young child on the narrow path, someone is likely to caution you by saying: “What if his (or her) father or mother takes offence? What if they ask who sent you? Please, leave him (or her)”. How I remember, with nostalgia, those days when we were our brother’s keeper; when other parents would punish us and our own parents would be angry that the punishment was not severe enough. I can hear someone saying the world is now a dangerous place or the society has become bad. I laugh. If you are innocent, I am innocent and he/she is innocent, WHO THEN RUINED THE SOCIETY? Did it ruin itself? Source: Facebook
