By Ruona Isikeh Benin – The Vice-Chancellor (V-C) of the University of Benin (Uniben), Prof. Osasere Orumwense, has advised the students of the Faculty of Law to be prepared for the challenges in the legal sector. Orumwense said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria
(NAN) after giving a lecture to the law students of the institution on
Monday in Benin. The title of his lecture was: “Law in time of rapid global change:
Challenges and Problems in the 21st Century, and  was held at the
university’s Faculty of Law’s hall. Orumwense was represented by Prof. Ikponwonsa Omoruyi, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the university. He said that the students of the faculty remain the best in terms of conduct and learning of new skills to address vital issues. According to him, when law students go anywhere you know they are law students because they always carry themselves differently. “The university is very pleased and we want you to keep it up and remain as peaceful as you have always been,” Orumwense said. Also, Prof. Engobo Emeseh, a London-based environmental lawyer,
emphasised on the need for lawyers to be creative, motivating and
inventing. “In our time, man’s capability to transform his surroundings, if used
wisely can bring to people the benefits of development and the
opportunity to enhance the quality of life. “Law is about organising societies to create a stable, sustainable, legal environment; law is about social control. “Think about how to be creative with law in this new age and global world by conducting real and innovative researches.” “You must be prepared to face the outside world and ensure you are distinguished,” Emeseh said. Emeseh, who graduated from the faculty in 1991 advised the students to be their own inspiration and competition. She urged the students to start networking, socialising, building relationships and creating cases that can discuss as a group.
