By Mats Anderson The population of Africa is expected to grow exponentially in the next 50 years. What is Europe doing to prepare for an eventual massive refugee and migrant crisis? Wrong premise. (I wish there was a simple button to click for this.) Firstly, Africa’s population is expected to grow, but nowhere near “exponentially”. That term means “doubling every X years”, and in reality, the increase is predicted to decline, and the population to peak in the early 2100s. This follows the pattern from the rest of the world: when people grow more prosperous, family size goes down. This has already happened in some African countries. Secondly, the population will only keep growing if available resources permit it. It’s like with any population, of any organism, anywhere. This doesn’t mean there has to be a disastrous event, such as famine or epidemics; it is just that as available resources dwindle, growth slows. Thirdly, how on Earth do you draw the conclusion that there will inevitably be a “massive refugee and migrant crisis” because a population grows? If that were the case, Africa would already have been swamped with European refugees centuries ago. Any such event happens not because of some immutable law of humanity, but because of something that is well within human power to prevent or mitigate: wars, natural disasters, and the like. Mind you, it is quite possible that parts of Africa will become uninhabitable to humans in our lifetimes. Global warming might press what is known as “wet-bulb temperatures” up to 35C, which is lethal to humans inside a few hours. Then, we’re talking trouble. Fortunately, there is considerable work being done to counter global warming, all over the world. Source: Quora
