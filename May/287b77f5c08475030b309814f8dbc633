By Tukur Muntari Gwarzo – Prof. Adamu Abubakar-Gwarzo Foundation, an NGO, has constructed a total of 62 boreholes in Gwarzo Local Government Area (LGA) of Kano state. Prof. Adamu Abubakar-Gwarzo is the President of Maryam Abacha American University of Niger (MAAUN) and founder of the NGO. The Project Coordinator, Dr Lawal Kankia, disclosed this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) shortly after inaugurating the project in Gwarzo, on Sunday. Kankia said the boreholes were constructed in different parts of the LGA as part of the Foundation’s effort to alleviate the suffering of some rural communities in accessing potable drinking water. He said the project which was executed in two phases, had since been inaugurated and handed over to the communities in areas that the facilities were located. “The construction of 35 of the boreholes was completed on Friday, May 17, 2019, which is equivalent to 12 of the month of Ramadan (1440 AH). “The 35 inaugurated boreholes are under the second phase of the project, while the remaining 27 boreholes were sunk under the first phase of the project,” he said. The Project Coordinator called on benefiting communities to guard against vandalism of the facilities for sustainability. According to him, the Foundation would continue to assist various communities in areas of need, particularly in the provision of safe drinking water. Earlier in his remarks, the District Head of Gwarzo, Alh. Kabiru Bayero, thanked the Foundation for the gesture and urged other corporate bodies and individuals to emulate Abubakar-Gwarzo. Bayero prayed Almighty Allah to replenish his wealth and reward his efforts toward supporting humanity. “The owner of the Foundation is the son of the soil. We pray that other wealthy indigenes will emulate him by assisting their communities in similar ways,” he said.
