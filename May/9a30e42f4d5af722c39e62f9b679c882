The incident happened, yesterday, along the Awoyaya- Gbetu New Road axis of the Lekki-Epe Expressway in Lagos. It was gathered that upon crashing into the fence, the injured driver was abandoned by his chasers, who reversed immediately, and fled. However, the victimâ€™s car was seized by the house owner and he was forced to rebuild the fence before the car was released to him. Source
