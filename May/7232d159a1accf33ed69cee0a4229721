Abdullahi Shugaba Dutse – The Managing Director of Jigawa State Water Board,  Mr Zayyan Rabiu, says the state government will spend N37 million on some water projects across the state. Rabiu made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria ((NAN) in Dutse on Friday. He said that N28 million would be spent on the purchase of water
generating machines for Kazure and Birnin Kudu Local Government Areas of
the state, while N9 million would be spent on the rehabilitation of the
existing machines across the 27 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the
state. Rabiu said that the gesture was aimed at improving water supply in
rural areas as part of the dividends of democracy of Gov. Muhammadu
Badaru’s administration in the state. “Water is critical and essential to the socio-economic well being of
the people; hence the present administration in the state pays much
attention to it. “Gov. Badaru is interested in water supply. That is why he gives much
priority and also gives us necessary support to ensure that people both
in urban and rural areas are connected to water,’’ the managing
director said. “For instance, our generating sets develop 25 per cent electronic fault annually. “That is why the governor has released N9 million to us to
rehabilitate all the existing water pumping machines both in urban and
rural areas to ensure adequate water supply to residents,’’ he said.
