By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, and 393 others aboard an Ethiopian Airlines plane have escaped crash on Wednesday. A NAN correspondent, who was among the passengers, said the almost 5-hour flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to Lagos had been fine until the pilot attempted to land at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. The passenger aircraft, ET-901, had left Bole International Airport, Addis Ababa at 9:10am, Ethiopian time, (7 am Nigerian time) on Wednesday. Due to rain and heavy wind, the pilot overshot his landing on the first touchline of the runway. The pilot instead landed on the third touchline. On realising this, the pilot quickly took the plane back on air, flying out of Lagos airport. The incident was said to have caused panic among passengers and crew members. The pilot hovered around Lagos and areas suspected to be Ogun State before returning to Lagos airport after about 20 minutes.
