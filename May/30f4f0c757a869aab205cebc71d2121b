ABUJA – Following the renewal of the tenure of Mr. Godwin Emefiele,  Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), those hurt by the policies of the apex bank in the last five years namely importers and smugglers appear to have resolved to stop his confirmation at the Senate.The news of his reappointment came as a surprise to most importers, particularly those involved in the importatation of items tagged ‘not eligible for foreign exchange via the official window’. To this end, those caught in the web may have taken the gauntlet to take the fight to the door steps of the apex bank by deploying all ammunition in their arsenal to fight against the confirmation by the National Assembly. Checks by Sundiata Post revealed that most those in the rice and textile businesses in particular, who have been having sleepless nights over the nationalistic nature of Emefiele are now mobilizing through various means to discredit him. Not stopping at that, they have resorted to either to use the courts to scuttle the confirmation process or other means like sponsoring protests, concoction of spurious messages   And hacking into official conversations. However, Emefiele has remained undaunted as he vowed to fight smugglers using the powers enshrined in CBN Act 2007 and BOFIA to regulate the financial system and the economy at large toward higher productivity, employment generation, wealth creation and self reliance in the nearest future. Speaking recently in Katsina during the launch of input distribution to cotton farmers for 2019 farming season, driven by passion for economic rejuvenation, Mr. Emefiele reiterated that saboteurs  would be blacklisted from assessing financial services from banks operating in the country.
