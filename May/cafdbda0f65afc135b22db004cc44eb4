By Sunday John Keffi (Nasarawa State) â€“ Fire on Monday gutted the old Radio and Television studios at the Mass Communication Department of the Faculty of Art, Nasarawa State University, Keffi. Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof. Suleiman Bala-Mohammed, who made this known to newsmen in Keffi on Monday, described the incident as unfortunate. Bala-Mohammed, who expressed appreciation to the students who helped to put out the fire, said that measures would be taken to mitigate the havoc caused by the fire. He called for understanding from the students and staff, especially those in the Facility of Arts, and apologised for the inconveniences the incident would cause them. The vice chancellor said that safety measures would be taken to ensure that such incidents did not happen again. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the vice chancellor had contacted fire service officials in Nyanya while the fire was raging but because the Fire Service station had no fire fighting facilities it could not render any help. NAN learnt that it was after the VC had contacted the 177 Guards Battalion in Shittu Alao Barracks, Keffi that the university authorities were able to get a water tanker which was used along with that of the university and one other from Keffi town to quell the fire. NAN further gathered that studio equipment such as video cameras, video data machine, and editing suites as well as other valuables worth millions of naira were destroyed in the inferno. Meanwhile, the Registrar of the university, Mr Bala Ahmed, has directed the security personnel in the university to safeguard other valuables belonging to the institution. (NAN)
