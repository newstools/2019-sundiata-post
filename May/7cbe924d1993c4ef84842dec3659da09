It’s extremely painful to see Ned Nwoko, my senior neighbour get married to my 17 year old daughter today – Regina Daniels’ father weeps in a phone conversation with a journalist. Some excerpts from an exclusive interview between Barrister Jude Ojeogwo who is the biological father of actress Regina Daniels and team Cutiejuls have been released. When asked how old Regina is, the father said Regina Daniels is turning 18 in October this year. He also explained that the reason why Rita Daniels has made herself the sole decision maker is because of greed and the fact that her bride price could not be paid due to the fact that her paternal family could not be traced. He also mentioned that Ned Nwoko is 62 and not 59 as they both grew up in the same compound as young boys. He also said he spoke to Regina this morning and warned her but Regina told her about what she is getting into but Regina advised its her mother’s decision and that Ned Nwoko is a fine gentleman and she loves him. He also stated that despite not paying Rita Daniel’s bride price, he has been very responsible for the financial support of all his 4 kids with Rita and that the 2 boys lived with him until recently when the mother advised they move in with her into her new home.
