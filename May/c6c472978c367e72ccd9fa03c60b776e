By Didier Champion If implemented well, it can be a game changer. We don’t need a political federation, however. That’s a pipe dream. We need one currency, free movement of people and goods to reduce transportation costs in our region, good infrastructure to facilitate businesses, and remove custom duties on borders. Once the above are achieved, let’s all learn Swahili and make it the language of our region. From there, we can start talking about a federation. For now, this is a pipe dream as our leaders are too slow to implement the EAC mandates. And plus, the people are not informed enough to push their leaders to move fast on the agenda. Source: Quora
