Following Regina Daniels’ alleged marriage to Nigerian businessman Ned Nwoko, the actress has been labeled all sorts on various social media platforms. And to say her social splurge isn’t helping seeing how the fans react whenever she posts the new stuff she buys on the gram. Several of the comments directed at Regina have been aimed at condemning her, to say the least. Recently, a man weighed in on the particular issue. The individual identified as @amferdinand on Instagram slammed Regina Daniels. But he did not just attack the lady, he also dragged her mother into his comment. This individual compared Regina Daniels and her mother to yahoo boys. According to him, the only difference between the actress, her mom and these internet fraudsters is the use of a laptop. Source
