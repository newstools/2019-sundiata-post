By Afam Orji There’s no word i hate more than “Best” and “Better”. That’s because those are relative terms which depends on what exactly we’re talking about. There are areas where Ghana is better than Nigeria and vice-versa. Ghana has a higher standard of living and is generally cleaner and has lower levels of crime and unrest. it also has relatively better educational institutions. Nigeria on the other hand is more economically viable which means that more money can be made in Nigeria and businesses do better in terms of volume. Nigeria also is better for enterainment. So, really, it depends on what you are referring to. Source: Quora
