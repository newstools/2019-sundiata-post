By Vivian Ibobo Lagos – A trader, Amarachi Ogbuehi, 38, on Thursday appeared in an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, for allegedly obtaining N900,000 under the guise of securing an Oman visa for a man. Ogbuehi, who resides at No.18, Alaje St., Egbeda in Lagos, is charged
with conspiracy, fraud, stealing and forgery, to which she pleaded not
guilty. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Ishola Samuel, told the court that Ogbuehi, with
one  other now  at large, committed the offence on April 10, 2017, at
Old Abeokuta Motor Road, Agege in Lagos. Samuel said that the defendant obtained N900,000 from the
complainant, Mr Kennedy Jonathan, under the pretext of securing the Oman
visa for him. He said the defendant told Jonathan that she had connections all over the place to help him to secure the visa. Samuel alleged that Ogbuehi, who did not secure the visa, forged an Oman visa and gave it to the complainant as genuine. The prosecutor said the offence contravened the provisions of
sections 287, 314, 365 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Magistrate I. A. Abina admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N200, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Abina said that the sureties must be gainfully employed, and must show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She adjourned the case until June 3, for mention.
