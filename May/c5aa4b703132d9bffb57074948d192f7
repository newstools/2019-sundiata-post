By Yakubu Uba Yola, – Alhaji Sadiq Daware, the National Chairman of North East Commodity Association (NECAS), on Thursday urged the Federal Government to purchase grains from farmers involved in Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP), to enable them repay their loans. Daware made the call in Yola in an interview with News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN) while reacting to the recent approval of N9.4billion by
the  Federal Executive Council’s (FEC)  for the purchase of 60,000
metric tones of grains. NECAS is the accredited commodity association implementing body of the ABP in North East. Daware said by purchasing from the farmers who recorded good yield
last cropping season, particularly in the north east, they ( farmers)
 would not only repay their loans, but continue to participate in the
laudable programme. He cautioned against the use of middlemen for the purchase of the
grains as they would not give farmers good price for their produce. “The approval by the FEC to purchase grains for Nigerian Food and
Strategic Reserve is the right thing in the right direction, especially
now that the government has encouraged local production and the farmers
have answered the clarion call of going back to farm. “Substantial number of farmers have keyed into the FG Anchor
Borrowers Programme by borrowing funds to cultivate their crops and have
gotten excellent yields. “So, purchasing the grains from our farmers at good price will go
long way in helping them repay loans and strengthen local production. He noted that NECAS had no good silos and that its grains could be
attacked by rodents and insects if kept un-preserved for long. “We urge government to consider us and purchase grains from us so
that our farmers can pay back their loans and confidently go back to the
land for the next farming cycle,” Daware appealed
