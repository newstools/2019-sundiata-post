By Christian Ogbonna Yenagoa – The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has begun enumeration for the distribution of seedlings to farmers affected by the 2018 flood in Bayelsa. Mr Eric Ebhodaghe, Agency’s Team Leader in the state, told the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Yenagoa on Wednesday that the Federal
Government targeted over 3,000 farmers across the eight local government
areas in the state. Ebhodaghe, also Supervisor of the National Food Security Council
(NFSC) for the Agency in South-South, said the intervention, in three
phases, included verification/enumeration, distribution and cultivation. “Mr President, Mohammadu Buhari, has ordered for intervention for
farmers that were affected by the 2018 flood disaster across 14 states
in the country, including Bayelsa. “The intervention is also part of the Federal Government’s efforts to cushion the effect of food insecurity in the country. “This exercise is coming in form of agro inputs to the farmers. The
inputs are mainly seedlings, agro chemical and fertilizers that are
quite peculiar to this region. Some of the seedlings are maize, plantain
and rice . “It will cut across the identified local government areas in the
state. Presently, we have gone about five out of the eight local
government of Baylesa. The targeted farmers are being enlisted from this
areas. “The intervention is a Federal Government programme but we are
working with the state government and other stakeholders and experts
from the federal and state ministry of agriculture. “It is basically for crop farmers. We believe that this planting
season is the right period for the distribution,” Supervisor explained.
