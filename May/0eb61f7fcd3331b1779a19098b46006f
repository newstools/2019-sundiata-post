By Ingo Bauer There are opportunities all over the country. FULL STOP !!! What it takes for most immigrants, especially the ones that were somewhat successful in their home country to get rid of their entitlement attitude. You come to a new country. New societal rules, new work environments, new laws, new culture, new requirements for existing job qualifications. The MAJORITY of immigrants will NOT have a lateral job entry. You are expected to make things happen on your own. NO-ONE will give you a break because you are “honoring” us with your presence. You will catch a break as soon as people think you are worth while getting one. Sometimes that takes a while. Attitude plays a big role in becoming a successful immigrant. I know !! I am one. Is Canada perfect. Nope. Pretty close though. I made the move 28 years ago. It was hard at times. Do I have regrets. None !!! Source: Quora
