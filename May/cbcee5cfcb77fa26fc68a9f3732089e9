The Court of Appeal in Abuja has reversed the April 3, 2019 judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja which sacked Senator Peter Nwaoboshi as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Delta North Senatorial seat. Justice Mohammed Idris, in the lead judgment, held that the suit by Nwoko was statute barred and that Justice Ahmed Mohammed of the Federal High Court, Abuja ought not to have heard the case and gave the judgment he gave in favor of Nwoko. The three-man panel of the Court of Appeal, in a unanimous judgment on Thursday, held that the Federal High Court had no jurisdiction to have heard the case filed by Ned Nwoko. Justice Mohammed had, in the April 3, 209 judgment, sacked Nwaoboshi as the PDP candidate for the last election in Delta North Senatorial district and among others, ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to accept Nwoko as the party’s candidate. Before This Judgment The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on May 11, 2019, withdrew the Certificate of Return it issued to the chairman, Senate Committee on Niger Delta Development Commission, (NDDC) and senator representing Delta North senatorial district of Delta state, Peter Nwaoboshi. Mrs. Oluwatoyin Babalola Esq. INEC Director of Legal Services issued the Certificate of Return withdrawn from the senator representing Delta North senatorial district of Delta state, Peter Nwaoboshi to Ned Nwoko as Senator-Elect for Delta North Senatorial District at the commission’s headquarters Abuja,
