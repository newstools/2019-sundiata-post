File photo   A Nigerian woman has asked for help after revealing that she’s sleeping with her boyfriend and her sister.   She wrote to relationship blogger, Joro Olumofin asking for help. Read below: “Hello Joro, I would love to be kept anonymous. I’ve been thinking a lot and it’s eating me up really bad. I’m bisexual and I’ve been seeing a girl for years now. One day I was at her place then I met her older brother, we got talking and later exchanged numbers. We are currently dating and he doesn’t know I’m sleeping with his sister.Now he wants to marry me and all and I don’t know what to do because I’m emotionally attached to both of them, his sister keeps telling me I can’t be seeing both of them and I can’t marry her brother as well. I’m in love with her brother, but s*x with the sister is better.” Source:http://Tori.ng
