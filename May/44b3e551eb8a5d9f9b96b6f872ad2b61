Actress Cossy Ojiakor took to the comment section to call The General Overseer and Senior Pastor of Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman a ‘mini pricked pastor’ after a blogger shared a video of the Christian cleric talking about purchase of private jet. Cossy has been seeking the attention of the controversial pastor in the last two years. She recently revealed that Apostle Suleman promised her a Range Rover SUV but failed to redeem his promise. This time around, Cossy went hard on him asking him to shut up and use monies obtained from his church tithes to pay her off.  “Shut
up already fool….. just use the tithe and pay me off. Mini pricked
pastor. Now u will see all those I introduced to him posing in private
jet” Cossy insinuated in the past that she worked as a pimp for a
particular ‘man of God’ whose identity she hasn’t clearly stated over
time.  Source:http://withinnigeria.com
