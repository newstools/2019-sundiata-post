By Rita de Maria Well, in origin humanity came from Africa however this does not mean/support that humanity is derived from current day “Africans” All of humanity evolved with time. Melanesians are racially/genetically unrelated to sub saharan “black” Africans. The pacific populations are not racially negroid, but australoids. Melanasians are known to have a recessive blond genetic mutation, this occured within their denisovan DNA. Melanesian DNA.. comprises between 4% and 6% Denisovan admixture. One that is proposed to have came from Australia, a very different genetic pool than sub saharan Africans. Haplogroup D is found basically among Melanesians, Aborginal Australians and to a lesser extent Philippino Negritos. Non of them are directly related to any modern sub saharan African groups or the Americas, which lack Y-DNA haplogroup D. Also important to mention that Australian Aborigines and Papuans have Neanderthal admixture, same as other Eurasians unlike sub saharan Africans(some do but more or less 1 precent). The languages spoken among “black” sub saharan Africans do not have any association with Austronesian languages either. Source: Quora
