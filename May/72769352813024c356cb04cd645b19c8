By Deborah Coker Benin â€“ The National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) Edo Command said on Thursday that it arrested 32 suspects in April in connection with illicit drug peddling. The NDLEA Commander in the state, Mr Buba Wakawa, who disclosed this on Thursday in Benin at a press briefing, said 17 of the suspects were males while 15 were females. Wakawa said that the command seized a total of 70,800 tablets of various psychotropic substances as well as 1,262.73kilogrammes of substance suspected to be cannabis sativa (Indian hemp). According him, officers attached to the Irrua command of the agency arrested two suspects smuggling 70,800 tablets of various psychotropic substances. The substances, he said, included 53, 250 tablets of diazepam, 14,430 tablets of tramadol, 3000 tablets of exol and 120 tablets of rophynol. The commander said that on interrogation, the suspects, who claimed to have started the business three years ago, said they were heading to Gombe State. Wakawa, however, said that it was unclear if they had any link with Boko Haram terrorists, but added that investigation was ongoing. He said an ash Volkswagen Gulf 3 with Edo registration number, AGD 790 GU, used by the suspects was seized. The commander stressed that there was no hiding place for drug traffickers in the state and anyone caught dealing in narcotic drugs would be made to face strict sanctions under the NDLEA Act. He further said that the suspects would soon be charged to court.
