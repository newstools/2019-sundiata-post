By Muhammad Nasir Bashir Dutse, – The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Jigawa Command, has advised farmers and herdsmen to co-exist peacefully to enhance the socio-economic development of the state. NSCDC spokesman in the state, Mr Adamu Shehu, gave the advice during
an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Dutse on Thursday. Shehu said the call was imperative to avoid farmers and herdsmen clashes, as well as encourage food production in the state. ‘‘We call on farmers to desist from encroaching into designated grazing reserves and cattle routes. ‘‘We also urge the herders to restrict their grazing activities on
the designated grazing reserves and avoid encroachment into farmlands,’’
he advised. The spokesman, who said the corps is a member of the local
Farmers/Herdsmen Conflict Resolution Committee in all the 27 councils of
the state, assured that the command would continue to ensure amicable
resolution of conflicts between the two groups. According to him, the corps’  ‘Agro Rangers’  are fully ready to ensure enforcement and compliance among the two groups. Shehu stated that NSCDC in the state was liaising with other sister
security agencies to ensure a violence-free 2019 cropping season.
