By Ngozi Njoku Lagos, – A 25-year-old unemployed man, Sulaimon Oladimeji, was on Friday docked before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos  State, over alleged theft of a mobile phone worth N55,000. Oladimeji, who has no fixed address, is facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. He, however, pleaded not guilty t o the charge. The prosecutor, Insp.

through the window of the bus and ran away. He said that some passersby  pursued the defendant until he was
caught but he had allegedly passed the phone to one of his cohorts. The prosecutor noted that the offences contravened Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 prescribes
three years’ imprisonment for stealing, while Section 411 stipulates two
years’ jail term for conspiracy. The Magistrate, Mrs Bukola Mogaji, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N15, 000 with a surety who must be his parent. Mogaji adjourned the case until May 13 for hearing.
