Suspected cultists, Saturday opened fire at football fans watching the FA Cup match between Mancity and Watford in Jos, the capital of Plateau State, killing one. Eyewitnesses say the ‘heavily armed’ men stormed the Garden Palace Hotel and Bar in Busa Buji, 5kms West of the city’s Terminal Market at about 7pm local time. A local football star, Mr. John Davou was hit three times in the head and several times in other parts of the body, sources say. Davou, 25, died instantly while a father of two, Mr. Francis Bot, sitted close to him sustained bullet wounds, it was gathered. Davou was probably the target, said his neighbor, Mr. Nengak Matthew. “He was the only one pelted with bullets while everyone else was hit by a stray bullet,” Matthew said. Mr. Davou was however just a hopeful undergraduate, rewriting his West African Examinations Council (highschool) papers after seating for the 2019 pre-university Joint Admission and Matriculations Board Examinations. The reason for the attack by a mostly university-based cult group is therefore unknown. Officials have yet to comment on the incident. Source
