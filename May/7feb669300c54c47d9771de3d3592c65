By Sandra Umeh Lagos – The police  on Tuesday docked a businessman, Augustine Oshoke, before a Federal High Court in Lagos, over alleged N56 million fraud. Oshoke was charged with conspiracy and obtaining money by false pretences. The defendant, who was  not represented by a lawyer, pleaded not guilty to the two-count  charge. The prosecutor, Mrs Gladys Imegwu, asked the court for a trial date to enable the prosecution to present its case. She also urged the court to remand the defendant pending his trial. Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke consequently  adjourned the case until July 4 for trial. Aneke ordered that the defendant should be kept in prison pending the trial. According to the charge, the defendant  committed the offences in December 2017. He allegedly conspired with others at large to obtain N56 million under false pretences from one Mr Hassan, in contravention of Sections 1(3) and 5 of the Advanced Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related offences Act, 2006.
