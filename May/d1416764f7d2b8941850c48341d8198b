Maureen Ojinaka Enugu – An Enugu East Magistrates’ Court on Thursday struck out a two-year old case involving one Sunday Nwaoyia, who was charged with malicious threat to life. The Magistrate, Mr Denis Ekoh, had adjourned the case several times,
because the complainant Chidi Akabuogu, failed to show up in court on
almost all adjourned dates. “I remember this case, the complainant had been absent in so many adjournments, I therefore, strike out the matter,”he said. Ekoh said that the case was over the defendant’s commission on a land
which he took the complainant to and showed him as an agent. “After showing the land to the complainant, he (Akabuogu) went behind
the defendant and paid for the land without paying the defendant his
commission. “When the defendant approached him for his commission on the said
land, he decided to intimidate him by bringing him to court rather than
paying him as agreed earlier,”he said. The Magistrate said that the complainant refused to honour the terms
of agreement between him and the defendant, but wanted to intimidate the
defendant by asking him to sign an apology letter. The prosecution counsel, Innocent Egbuaba, had earlier explained that
the complainant was not in court because he was not well and pleaded
for the court to give him a short date to appear. Egbuaba added that the complainant had said that he would be withdrawing the matter in the next adjourned date.
