acquire weapons for inter-tribal wars; His Excellency is hereby called
upon to please instruct the relevant agency to pay the affected
civil/public servants their April 2019 salary,’’ labour stated in its

The order makes it compulsory for all local government allocations to go straight to their respective bank accounts. Nkah said that the new measure would boost development across the 774 local government councils in the country.
