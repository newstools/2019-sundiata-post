Recently, ‘Togolese officials went to France to meet with the diaspora and they were received with flour,’ tweeted Farida Bemba Nabourema, a Togolese human rights activist. The West African country has been under the leadership of President Faure Gnassingbé since 2005. His regime has been widely criticised as intolerant to freedom, free speech and opposition. Few days ago, the country changed its law to let the President stand for two more terms. The pelting with flour might be connected to how the country is being ran by its officials, including the ones who had gone to visit the diaspora in France.
