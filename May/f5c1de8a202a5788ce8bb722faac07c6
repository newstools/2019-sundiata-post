WHEN A SOCIETY IS PERMISSIVE, LIKE OURS, IT CAN NEVER KNOW PEACE!  No social menace can fester unless there is a PERMISSIVE SOCIETY. The society must indulge negativism for it to grow. That’s the fact that we often don’t consider. Ours is an EXTREMELY PERMISSIVE SOCIETY. We can rationalise anything as long as MONEY is involved. We WORSHIP SUCCESS and we are ENSLAVED TO the PURSUIT of PROSPERITY. Is it wrong to pursue success and prosperity? No and no. It is LEGITIMATE to aspire to be rich and comfortable. Where the problem lies is HOW you aspire. The Yahoo boy menace degenerated to ritualism because we celebrated overnight successes of those guys. In fact, the usual saying was “they are paying the money they owed our forefathers”. This emboldened these guys and they took it a step further: stealing pants, eating feaces, sleeping with animals all in the name of trying to make money. At the back of their minds, they know they are dealing with a society that does NOT care how they make the money. Even churches will celebrate them. Their families will worship them. Many of us preaching morality here can do anything to make money. As long as no one will find out. Even if anyone finds out, the society will accuse the person of JEALOUSY. And because we are assured of the convenience of ascribing every success to God, no one really cares. “God has done it,” we often say in shameless escapism. We were raised up to APPRECIATE HARD-WORK before we CELEBRATE SUCCESS. Today, even a 10 year-old knows you can become rich overnight BY ANY MEANS and the society will celebrate you and even “children of God” will use you as point of contact with Him. There is no better way to ruin our future than this…
