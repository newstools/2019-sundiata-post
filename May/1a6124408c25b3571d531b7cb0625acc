It seems like there is love lost between former Super Eagles player, Emmanuel Emenike and his wife, Iheoma Nnadi. It has now been confirmed that the duo unfollowed each other on Instagram. Many attribute the recent drama to alleged frosty relationship between the couple. He now follows only two accounts â€“ FC Spartak Moscow and fenerbahce. Speculations are rife as followers of the drama expect press statements from the parties. Nnadi is a former Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria winner and got married to Emenike on Saturday, May 25 2018. Today marks their one year wedding anniversary, and unexpectedly, they are not celebrating it. Source
