The Nigeria Football Federation has appointed former Super Eagles’ captains Austin Okocha and Nwankwo Kanu, as well as former star winger Tijani Babangida as scouts and motivational figures for Nigeria’s campaign at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. According to NFF General Secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, the three legends will monitor the activities of the Eagles’ opponents leading to the AFCON finals and report to coach Gernot Rohr, and will continue their assignment in Egypt during the tournament. “Okocha, Kanu and Babangida served Nigeria meritoriously as players and we believe they have the capacity to excel in this particular assignment. They will also serve as role models for our young team in Egypt,” Dr Sanusi told thenff.com on Tuesday.
