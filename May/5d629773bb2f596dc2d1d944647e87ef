Abu Dhabi – The United Arab Emirates says it has released a Qatari military boat that was held after it entered the country’s territorial waters on April 30. “The boat had four military personnel on board, two Qataris, a
Palestinian and an Indian, when it was seized,’’ the UAE’s Foreign
Ministry said in a statement on Monday. In June 2017, the UAE was among four Arab countries, including Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, that severed diplomatic and trade ties with
Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism, a charge that Doha denied. The quartet demanded that Doha downgrade ties with Iran, a regional rival of Saudi Arabia. Qatar rejected the demand, calling it an “infringement of its sovereignty.’’ The row between Qatar and the four Arab states is one of the most
serious experienced by the Gulf Cooperation Council since it was created
in 1981.
