Eden Hazard told Chelsea supporters “it is goodbye” after inspiring a second half performance that saw his side beat Arsenal 4-1 in the Europa League final. The Belgian winger has long flirted with leaving Chelsea in search of a new challenge and is expected to join Real Madrid in the summer transfer window. After scoring twice in the Baku final, Hazard revealed he is waiting on “both clubs” to finish talks and that a conclusion should be reach in a “couple of days”. Chelsea’s elite winger reminded everyone why he is one of the most sought-after players in Europe with a fine performance against Arsenal in what is very likely to be his final game in blue. “I think this is a goodbye,” he told BT Sport. “I think in football you never know.” “My dream was to play in Premier League I did this for seven years with one of the biggest clubs in the world. I think it’s time for a new challenge.” Hazard initially admitted he was only thinking about winning the trophy, but went on to hint that Chelsea are in talks with a potential buyer. “My target today was to win the trophy and that is the only thing that was in my mind,” he said.“I’ve made my decision already I said that two weeks ago and now it depends on the club so I am just waiting… both clubs. I am just waiting like you wait, the fans wait. You will know in a couple of days.” Pedro, who scored the second goal of the game, added “I link with him good, he’s the best players. Always score dribble pass. He is a top player.” David Luiz refused to be drawn on the transfer talk. “It is just speculation,” he said. “Now is just the moment to talk about the title.” Indy Football
