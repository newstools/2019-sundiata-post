By Adenike Ayodele Ikeja – An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Monday remanded two men, David Nwose, 19, and Moses Awotoye, 28, in prison for allegedly storming a market and robbing a man of N75, 000 at gun-point. Nwose, a welder and Awotoye, a bus conductor, whose residential
addresses were not provided, are facing a two-count-charge of conspiracy
and robbery. The Chief Magistrate, Mr A.A. Fashola, remanded the duo at the
Kirikiri Prisons, pending advice from the Department of Public
Prosecutions (DPP). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that they defendants’ pleas
were not taken as Fashola ruled that the case file be duplicated and
sent to the Office of the DPP. Earlier, the Police Prosecutor, Sgt. Michael Unah, alleged the
defendant armed themselves with two locally-made single barrel guns, one
double barrel gun, three cutlasses,
two knives and one axe and robbed one Michael Odunlade of N75, 000. Unah told the court that the defendants committed the offences with
others still at large on April 6 at 10.00 a.m. at Iyana-Iba Market, Ojo
in Lagos. He submitted that the defendants stormed the complainant
unaware, injured him with the dangerous weapons and robbed him of his
N75, 000 at gun-point. “The defendants, who also injured a lot of traders at the market,
were apprehended by policemen while the other accomplices took to their
heels,’’ he said. NAN reports that the offences contravene Sections 297 and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015 (Revised). The case was adjourned until June 3, for the DPP’s advice.
