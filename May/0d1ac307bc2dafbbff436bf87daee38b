MAIDUGURI – John Achagwa, the Chief Steward to Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State, has committed suicide at the Presidential Lodge, Government House, Maiduguri. The Chief Steward was said to have greeted his colleagues at the lodge at about 1: 44 p.m. on Tuesday before he climbed a tree behind the lodge and hanged himself. A close associate of late Achagwa said the deceased had been complaining about the attitude of his daughter, saying, “this girl will kill me.” He said: “He came and asked me to delete someone’s number from his phone. I told him I don’t know how to delete it. He left angrily, only for me to hear that he has hanged himself, after some few minutes.” Mr. Achagwa who retired from the civil service about three years ago was retained by the governor due to exceptional delicacies. He was also said to have been promised to be appointed Village Head of Dille, Askira Uba Local Government Area. (•New Telegraph)
