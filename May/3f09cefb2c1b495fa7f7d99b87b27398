Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has confirmed the arrest of singer, Afeez Fashola, popularly known as Naira Marley. News of Naira Marley’s arrest broke Friday morning. The commission’s acting spokesperson, Tony Orilade, was quoted as telling Punchng.com that Naira Marley was arrested in relation to internet fraud cases known locally as ‘Yahoo Yahoo’. “Yes, he is with us. He’s not the only person; he had some other persons also arrested alongside (him). “They were arrested in relation to advance fee fraud — Internet-related cases and all of that. Give me a little time and I will get you the details,” Mr Orilade said. Naira Marley had on Thursday released the official video of latest single, Am I A Yahoo Boy, featuring Zlatan Ibile. In April, the controversial rapper said in an Instagram post that if anyone knew about the transatlantic slave trade they would not refer to ‘Yahoo Yahoo’ as a crime. He also urged Nigerians to pray for cybercriminals because they contribute to the economy. His comments caused a storm on social media with some criticising him and others supporting him.
