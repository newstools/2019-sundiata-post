By Cecilia Ijuo Abuja – Sen. Yahaya Abdullahi, Chairman, Lawan Campaign Group has described Sen. Ahmad Lawan as an astute politician that seeks peace with all men. Abdullahi(APC-Kebbi), who said this at the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) flagship programme in Abuja, stressed that the virtue had endeared him to his colleagues in the National Assembly and other associates. The lawmaker said Lawan, who is seeking to be President of the 9th Senate, is the best candidate for the job. According to him, contrary to expectations, Lawan did not “make trouble when he was shortchanged from being president of the senate in 2015”, noting that his approach to the matter showed his sportsmanship. He said “after the 2015 election, Sen. Lawan did not make trouble instead he was made the Chairman Senate Committee on Defence and he accepted willingly. “He was later made the Leader of the Senate after the former leader fell out with his group. “So you can see that he is man of peace and deserves to be the president of the senate.” (NAN)
