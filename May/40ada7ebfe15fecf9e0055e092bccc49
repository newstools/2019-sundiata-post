By Ezra Musa Kaduna – The Managing Director of the Kaduna State Water Corporation, Mr Sanusi Maikudi, has urged staff of the corporation to protect the agency’s facilities from vandalism. Maikudi made this known on Thursday when he visited staff of the
corporation at Ikara, Saminaka and Kafanchan water treatment plants in
the state. He said that the state government has spent huge sum of money to
provide potable water to its citizens, hence the need for the staff to
reciprocate the gesture by protecting facilities under their care. Maikudi, who had paid a similar visit to Kaduna, Zaria, Kagoro,
Zonkwa, Manchock and other water treatment plants, said that it was a
continuous process. He assured residents of the state of the corporation’s willingness to ensure regular water supply. He explained that the current power outage in the state was a major cause of the water scarcity. Maikudi explained that unless there is 24 hours uninterrupted power
supply, water scarcity will hardly cease, saying that it was not
possible to rely solely on diesel to pump water for the public.
