By Mohammed Lawal Zaria – The Management of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Northern District, Zaria, has warned passengers against hanging on train while on transit. Mr Abdullahi Alhaji, Northern District Public Relations Officer of
NRC, gave the warning in a statement in Zaria, Kaduna State on Thursday. Alhaji expressed concern over the attitude of some passengers, who
due to large turn-out of passengers, hanged on the train as normal
seats. “The management of Nigerian Railway Corporation, Northern District,
observed that some passengers are in the habit of climbing the top of
the economic class coaches while on transit. “The management wishes to call on this segment of people to desist
from such act as it is very dangerous to their lives and unacceptable to
the management. “The Nigerian Railway Corporation will not be held liable in the event of any negative consequences. “If the coaches are congested, the passengers are advised to exercise
patience and wait for the next trip of train,’’ he advised.
