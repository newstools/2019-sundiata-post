By Ngozi Njoku Lagos – A bank customer, who allegedly breached a loan agreement after obtaining N1.8 million on Friday, appeared before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. The defendant, Christopher Oweiboh, 40, whose address was not provided, is facing one-count charge of a conduct likely to cause breach of peace. He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecutor, Insp Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that the defendant committed the offences since July 2018 at Ikosi road Ketu. Ihiehie said that Oweiboh obtained N1, 850, 000 loan from AB Micro finance Bank, Ketu with a collateral of 300 crates of empty bottles and two Toyota Dana pick up trucks. He said that the defendant after collecting the said loan, went ahead to cause a breach of peace by selling the said 300 crates and the trucks without the consent of the bank guarantor and ran away. According to him, the offences contravene Section 168(d) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. Magistrate E. Kubeinje, granted the defendant N50,000 bail with two sureties each and an evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned until July 2 for trial. (NAN)
