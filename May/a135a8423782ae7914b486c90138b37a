By James Gambleton We all love a list don’t we. Now I know that I could have gone on, but I don’t want to falsify answer no50. I realise that some of the items on the list other countries may do better, but when you add all this up and some of the stuff that I have missed, that is what makes the UK IMHO the greatest country in the world, bar none. Regarding no7, I know our history is bit controversial, all I am saying is that we have a lot of it, good and bad. God save the Queen. Source: Quora
