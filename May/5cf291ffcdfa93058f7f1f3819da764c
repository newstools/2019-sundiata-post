Blessing Okoro, blogger and owner of Break_or_Makeup Instagram page has been arrested and handcuffed by security agents after she went on social media to claim a duplex belonging to a China-based Nigerian businessman. The owner of the house identified as Onye Eze facilitated the arrest after accusing the blogger of trying to tarnish his image. Recall that Okoro had over the weekend shared a photo of the duplex claiming that she built it from the scratch. Even all efforts to prove that she isnâ€™t the owner of the house proved abortive as she continued to insist that the house belonged to her. Source
