Beijing – Chinese authorities will improve urban public transportation operation mechanisms and strengthen safety guarantee, according to the Ministry of Justice. According to a draft regulation released by the ministry on Friday to
solicit public opinions, urban public transportation management
departments should carry out surveys to learn about the public’s needs
and optimise public transit routes. The prices of public transit tickets should be set by the government, the regulation says. The regulation asks urban public transportation enterprises to assume
the main responsibility of ensuring safety production and establish
corporate safety management systems. The regulation requires that urban public transportation management
departments and enterprises take necessary measures to guarantee
operation safety in case of natural disasters, emergencies and mass
transit facility malfunctions. City governments are encouraged to promote the application of new
technology, energy and equipment in building smart urban public
transportation. The draft is open for public opinion until June 10.
