By Segun Giwa Akure, – Mr Saka Yusuf-Ogunleye, the Chairman, Board of Governing Council, National Youth Service Corps, Ondo State, on Friday, charged corps members serving in the state to be creative in their primary places of assignment. Yusuf-Ogunleye gave this charge during a week-long sensitisation tour
by members of the NYSC Local Government secretariats, which ended in
Akure on Friday. The board chairman, who doubled as the Commissioner for Youths and
Sports Development, said corps members should not wait till the end of
their service year before thinking of what to do. The commissioner noted that the right time for them to start
conceiving ideas of what they could do was now, adding that it would
integrate them into the society after the service. According to him, we want more of you to benefit from the presidential scholarship and automatic employment. “Therefore, start thinking of any project to do. People who control
the world economy today are not salary earners, rather their creativity
paved the way for them”. He admonished them to be security conscious and always be at peace
with their host communities, saying, “your security and welfare are very
important to the government”. Earlier in her opening remark, the NYSC State Coordinator, Mrs Grace
Akpabio, appreciated corps members for their orderly organisation,
despite the short notice given to them. Akpabio advised them to start thinking of laudable projects they could embark on that will distinguish them among their peers. She emphasised the need for them to enroll in any vocational skills
that would prepare the future for them, because “the white collar jobs
are no longer there”.
