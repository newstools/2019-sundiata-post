By Femi Ogunshola Abuja – Kwara North All Progressives Congress (APC) Elders’ Council on Wednesday called on the Governor -Elect, Alhaji Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq to ensure fair and equitable distribution of political appointments in the state. The elders in a communique jointly signed by Abubakar Mora, the
Chairman of the council, and Manzuma Abdulmalik, the Secretary in Abuja
said a sure approach would guarantee unity ad strengthen the party in
the state. The group advised that Kwara North should get a the ministerial slot,
Secretary to the State Government (SSG), membership of APC National
Executive Committee (NEC), and Speakership of the State House of
Assembly. They condemned some self-serving leaders for misplacing priorities of
the area, adding that the plight of the zone would no longer be taken
with levity. The zone, according to the group, gave an average of 82 per cent of
total votes from the area in the just-concluded general elections. They said that the region was not in contest with anybody or group of persons either within or outside the senatorial district. The elders’ council also emphasised that equity and fair play in
sharing of political offices remained the only key for building an
all-inclusive government, “which the governor-elect Abdulrasaq is
championing”. According to the group, getting the highly coveted ministerial slot
and SSG position will ensure inclusiveness of the zone in the politics
of the state.
