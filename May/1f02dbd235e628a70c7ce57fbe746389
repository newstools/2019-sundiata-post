 Nollywood actress, Tonto Dike, has revealed why she described her estranged husband, Olakunle Churchill as a “40 seconds” man. Tonto was responding to a fan who berated her for using Churchill’s alleged sexual deficiency to publicly shame him. Tonto said she made her ex-husband’s inabilities public because he first accused her of being on hard drugs.
