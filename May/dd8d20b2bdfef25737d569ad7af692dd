By Moses Kolo Kafanchan – The Kaduna State government has approved N54 million for the execution of various projects in Kaura Local Government, according to Bege Katuka, the council’s boss. Katuka told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Friday in Kaura that
projects to be undertaken included the construction of bore holes and
culverts, as well as the rehabilitation of roads in rural communities. He reassured the people of the council’s commitment to meeting their
demands, urging them to support and cooperate with management to ensure
success of policies and programmes. The chairman urged the people, especially farmers and herders, to
refrain from acts that could lead to a breach of peace, considering that
the farming season was here. He said that management would soon hold a town hall meeting where stakeholders would brainstorm on developments so far. “The goal is to get a feedback from the people. It is important to
gauge their moods and feelings. That is what we want to do,” he said.
