Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, daughter of national leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, on Wednesday said that she had power to choose whoever she wants as leader of traders at computer village, Ikeja. Tinubu-Ojo, leader of traders in Lagos and the Iyaloja General of Nigeria, said this on the backdrop of protest that greeted the planned installation of market leaders known as Iyaloja and Babaloja at computer village. She told journalists that all the markets in the state were under her control and that computer village market was not an exception. “According to our constitution, I can choose anybody from any local government in the state to head the market, all the iyaloja and babaloja in all the Lagos markets are my representatives in the market where they operate. Kindly educate them that phones, handsets, computers are commodities. “They cannot tell us they are not pepper sellers, everybody cannot be textile dealers; they can’t tell us that computer village will be exonerated (sic) from other markets. We have the right to choose for them Iyaloja and Babaloja. “Those people protesting never approached me to complain. They don’t have the initiative that the person leading the protest has finished his tenure and wants to remain in power… “Computer village is not just an ICT hub, there are a lot of commodities being sold there; nobody can say it is wrong to select a babaloja and iyaloja for the market. Those that have been selected were not selected because they are Yoruba, in some of our markets in Lagos we have Igbos that were selected as market leaders,” Tinubu-Ojo said. Source: qed.ng
