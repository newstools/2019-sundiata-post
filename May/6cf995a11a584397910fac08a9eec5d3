Abuja (Sundiata Post) – National and State Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Kaduna on Monday adjourned the pre-hearing session of the petition of Sen. Shehu Sani (PRP Kaduna Central) to Thursday, May 16. The adjournment was sequel to the filing of preliminary objection by the first respondent, Malam Uba Sani of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) who the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared winner of the Senate Seat for Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the 2019 general elections. INEC had declared Uba Sani winner after he defeated Lawal Adamu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Sen Shehu Sani of the Peoples’ Redemption Party (PRP) in the poll. However, both Lawal Adamu of the PDP and Shehu Sani rejected the results and filed separate petitions at the Tribunal challenging Uba Sani, INEC and the APC alleging that the election was marred by massive rigging and ballot stuffing. At the Pre-hearing session on Monday, the Chairman Justice A.H Suleiman said the first respondent (Uba Sani) had filed a motion moving for the preliminary objection on the case challenging his election victory, as earlier filed by Sen Shehu Sani. Justice Suleiman adjourned for adoption of pre-hearing conference forms of all the parties and had set the date to rule on the motion on preliminary objection filed by Uba Sani, the first respondent.
