Fear and apprehension have taken over Neni community, in Anaocha Local Government Area of Anambra State, following reports that the traditional ruler of the community, Chief Anthony Enukeme, is working towards building a mosque in the town. According to the report, Enukeme connived with some unidentified people outside the state to attract the Mosque to Neni as part of the grand plan to Islamise the state. Reacting to the accusation, Enukeme, said that though he does not discriminate against any religion, it was not true that he was planning to build a mosque in the state. The royal father, who is the Chairman and Managing Director of TONIMAS Nigeria Limited and president of the Anambra State Council of Traditional Prime Ministers, denied the allegation saying that it is the figment of the imagination of some social media practitioners. A statement he issued on Monday to journalists said: “My attention has been drawn to the falsehood and unpalatable insinuation being peddled in the social media that I am planning to build a mosque for the Hausa community in Neni, Anaocha Local Government Area of Anambra State with a bid to Islamize the state. “The publication is not only malicious and ridiculous, but a deliberate ploy to tarnish the good image I have garnered over the years. I am not planning to build mosque in the community, or planning to donate land for the Hausa community in Anaocha Local Government Area for a cemetery as alleged. The purveyors of the ugly and unwarranted publication and attacks only intended to cash in on my rare achievements, philanthropy and humanitarian services.” He called on those concerned to rather join hands with him to promote peace and tranquility in the state and focus on issues that unite instead of wasting their time on irrelevancies in the social media.
