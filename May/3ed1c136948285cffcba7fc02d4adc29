By Raji Rasak Lagos – The management of Ikeja Electric on Monday reiterated its commitment to the safety of its staff within its network area. Mr Felix Ofulue, the company’s Head of Corporate Communications gave the assurance in a statement in Lagos. The statement said that the company was aware of the wave of malicious attacks on its staff by some customers and cautioned that the company would no longer allow unwarranted attacks on its staff. “In line with the company’s obligation to provide service under a conducive atmosphere to our customers, we will continue to escalate such matters to law enforcement agencies,’’ it said. The statement said that some of the attackers in past cases had been sentenced to various prison terms by the courts, while urging aggrieved customers to remain mindful of these matters and adopt a more civil approach to engagements. It cited that Section 173 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State states that any person who unlawfully assaults another and thereby causes him harm commits felony and is liable to conviction and imprisonment for a period of not less than three years. “It is wrong for persons to attack our technical staff who are on the ladder, it is also an offence to throw them off the ladder. “Please note that Ikeja Electric has zero tolerance for assault on its staff and remains committed to protecting the lives of staff. “We will not hesitate to seek redress through any means, within the limits of the law,’’ the statement said. Ofulue also said that the company would promptly withdraw its services from such customers and communities that proved too hostile to company personnel.
