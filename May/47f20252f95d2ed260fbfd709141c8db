English side, Manchester United, have confirmed the exit of Spanish midfielder, Ander Herrera. The 29-year-old will be leaving the club this summer following five years with the Old Trafford side. “There is red in my heart, I knew it from the first time I played here and in the moment that I started to wear it. 
“A club with thousands of fans that respect and remember all the players who give everything.
“I felt special when I heard my name chanted. I felt proud when the fans decided I was part of this incredible history,” he said in a farewell video posted by the club. Herrera joined United in 2014 from Basque outfit, Athletic Bilbao, and has since gone on to make 189 appearances, scoring 20 goals. Although he has not confirmed his next destination, multiple reports are linking him with a summer move to French giants, Paris Saint-Germain. Source
