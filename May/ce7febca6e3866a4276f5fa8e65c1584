A student has shared on Twitter the moment her professor helped her to calm her crying baby and pamper him to sleep. She also said putting her son to sleep didn’t stop the professor from teaching. She wrote: “Last day of Maymester & had to bring KB w/ me so my professor put him sleep so I could participate in discussion.And putting him to sleep didn’t stop his teaching either!!
