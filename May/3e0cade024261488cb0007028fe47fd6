By Perpetua Onuegbu Abuja – A biogas expert, Mr Basil Nnamdi, has urged the Federal Government to use the abundant environmental waste in the country for the production of biogas. Nnamdi told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Abuja that
in doing so energy would become available to Nigerians and national
development would be stimulated. “Many countries, especially the developed countries, have turned the
waste in their environment to wealth by recycling them into other
byproducts or converting them to biogas for energy. “Biogas is the process of using biotechnology process to convert
waste to energy in the form of methane through anaerobic digestion. “Government has already set up agencies such as the National
Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA), National Biotechnology
Management Agency (NBMA), and others with the mandate to research and
develop this system. “What needs to be done is to invest more funds in these agencies. “If these agencies are well-funded and mandated to come up with
sustainable solutions to the various environmental challenges we face as
a country, they will be energised to work,’’ Nnamdi said. According to him, if biogas is adopted in the country, streets will
be free of heaps of refuse and this will promote the production of
environmentally friendly energy. Nnamdi said that biogas could also be used for cooking purposes and the production of byproducts used as organic fertilisers. He, therefore, urged the government to sensitise citizens to the
benefits of biogas and direct all state governments to set up waste
collection centres, where refuse collected from the streets could be
dumped for further processing.
