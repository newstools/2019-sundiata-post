It has been revealed that the immediate past Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha failed to effect a formal handover to the new governor, Emeka Ihedioha. Speaking to newsmen after the Inauguration ceremonies on Wednesday, Chairman of the Inauguration Planning and Handover Committee, Barr. Chris Okewulonu said, no official handover had been effected so far. “We are literally in the dark so to speak. Off course the outgone governor gave us no cooperation whatsoever. Unlike what we have had in the past during previous transitions here in IMO State and as was performed in other states, not one document has been handed over to the new administration. Yet he makes fantabulous claims about the amount in the treasury but as at today, no single paper to back up those claims. Formal handover, traditionally is performed before the official inauguration of the incoming administration, therefore I will be right to conclude that this aberration is another deliberate ploy to derail the rebuilding process. Okewulonu also said that there was never a meeting between the two principals since after the election, noting that the former governor may have left town. “What we have in Imo now can only be described as a void. But Governor Ihedioha is undeterred and indeed poised to forging ahead in his mission to rebuild the broken state.”
