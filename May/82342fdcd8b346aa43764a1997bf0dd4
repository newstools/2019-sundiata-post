By Usman Aliyu Ilorin – A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara, Mr Kazeem Yusuf, has appealed to all interest groups in the party to work in unison to enable the party meet the expectations of the people. Yusuf, who addressed newsmen on Tuesday in Ilorin, said unity had become imperative for the party in the wake of its victory in the 2019 general elections. He said that the intimidation, harassment and loss of property he suffered before the election was due to his loyalty to APC as a leader of the party. Yusuf  lamented the acts of vandalism at his family house in Igbaja, lfelodun Local Government Area of  Kwara, and a similar attack on his residence in Lagos. He implored party members to be wary of saboteurs bent on destabilisation, saying that there were still moles within the party. The APC chieftain also expressed confidence in the ability of the governor-elect, Alhaji Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, to give the people a new lease of life and called for patience. He appealed to APC leaders to eschew any move that could precipitate division in the party and destabilise the incoming government midway. “I can assure you, if the present O to Ge Movement managed the system and victory very well, though it is very difficult to manage, things will get better. A lot of people would come with divergent views that they made this happen. “It is a movement, just like what happened in Egypt and Libya, if it happened anywhere, nobody can stop it; it is a tsunami. ” But we have to be very careful because there is nothing anybody can say now than to be patient with each other. We need to be magnanimous in victory,” he said. The APC leader also appealed to all interest groups to come together and work as a team, saying that this was the only way they could actualise their objectives. (NAN)
