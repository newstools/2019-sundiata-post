By Rudolph Millan Ahhh … the dirty (no so little) secret: because, in reality, we don’t want to. The US and most other nations do not want to eliminate un-documented workers. Their economies depend on the availability of cheap labor from second class residents that are willing to do undesirable work at prices no one else will accept and have little or no recourse when they are abused. Legal immigration would eliminate the vulnerability of the undocumented, which would result in higher labor costs. Every major economic power throughout history had (has) such underprivileged classes. At one time, it used to be called slavery, and was enforced by direct means (the slave-master owned the individual, and was legally entitled to use force to dominate him or her). Now, the means of control are (only) a little more subtle: “I will pay you less because you are undocumented”, or the more onerous: “I will call the INS if you insist on getting paid for last week’s work or demand a safe work environment”. In some, probably more rare cases: “I can kill you right now and bury your body, and no one will even know you are missing, much less care”. There is also the matter of being able to more easily discriminate in deporting members of certain groups if they are un-documented. Source: Quora
