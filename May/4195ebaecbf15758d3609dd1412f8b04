Former Osun  State Governor, Rauf Aregbesola, was also honoured. The honour was  in recognition of  their leadership qualities and service to the APC since it was formed in 2014. The President was honoured for  his outstanding qualities in leadership, according to the organisers. They said  Buhari excelled by granting bailouts to states to pay inherited salaries, helping states to renegotiate loan repayments and the release of the Paris club refund. Speaking at the event  at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, Buhari said he was taken by a surprise, but admitted he had been encouraged to do more. He called on  the 36  states to work together to sustain the unity of Nigeria. The President said, “We remain committed to improving the welfare of the Nigerian people. Your excellencies,  it will be belabouring the point to say that true federalism is necessary at this juncture of our political and democratic evolution. Source:http://Punch.ng
