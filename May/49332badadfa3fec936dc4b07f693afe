Phnom Penh – The Cambodian Red Cross (CRC) collected 20.7 million dollars during an annual event, marking the 156th World Red Cross Day on Wednesday. The figure represented a 15 per cent increase from 18 million dollars the CRC raised in 2018’s event. Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen and his wife Bun Rany,
CRC’s president, attended the ceremony and accepted cash donations from
hundreds of donors, who are senior officials as well as domestic and
foreign businesspeople. Hun Sen expressed his profound gratitude to all donors for their
support to the CRC and said that the CRC had provided relief assistance
to almost 140,000 vulnerable families in 2018. “This is the culture of sharing from the rich to the poor and vulnerable people. “Your donations are very important for the CRC to continue its humanitarian activities,’’ he said at the event. The prime minister said the CRC’s work has greatly contributed to the
implementation of the government’s social protection policy. At the event, the Chinese embassy to Cambodia also donated 10,000 dollars to the CRC.
