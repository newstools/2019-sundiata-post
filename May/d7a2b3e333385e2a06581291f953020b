By Veronica Dariya Bwari(FCT) – A witness, Grace Luka on Wednesday told a Dutse Grade I Area Court in Abuja, that her boyfriend, Endurance Adams, withdrew N296,000 from her bank account, without her consent. Adams is charged with two counts of criminal breach of trust and theft. Led in evidence by Prosecution Council, Mr Collins Emorosale, Luka told the court that she gave her account number, ATM card and Pin number to the defendant sometime in 2018. ”I gave him because the defendant deceived me into believing that the forgot his ATM card in Kubwa and he was expecting some money transfer from his boss. “He was with the card for three days before he returned it to me. “Adams collected the card for the second time and this time around, it was with him for 10 days before he returned it to me. “When I collected the card back from him, I went to First bank branch in Bwari to check my balance. To my shock, the money was gone. “ I had N330,000 in the account and N296, 000 was gone,” she said. Luka told the court that after calling the defendant to explain what happened to her money, he asked her to see him in his house for an explanation. “He told me that he withdrew the money to assist one of his in-law in Maraba, Nasarawa State and that would reimburse me as soon as the person refund the money,’’ she said. The complainant said that the defendant had since then refused to pay back. But during cross- examination, the defendant’s counsel, Mr Benjamin Ogbangba, told the complainant that she was lying. He said that the money withdrawn by the defendant was the money sent to him by his boss. Ogbangba also said that Luka lured the defendant with her bank details so that he would marry her. “But because he refused to marry you, you came up with this claim,’’ he said. The Presiding Officer, Mr Suleiman Mohammed, adjourned further hearing on the matter, until May 9.(NAN)
