Lagos – The Ekiti State Government says it will assist youths who are talented in creativity to develop their skills and become job creators rather than remaining as job seekers. The Director-General (D-G) Council of Arts and Culture in the state,
Mr Wale Ojo-Lanre , gave the promise during an interactive session with
the Curator of Genesis Arts Gallery, Oshogbo, Osun , Mr Adeyinka Fabayo. This is contained in a press statement released to newsmen by Remi Oladoye from the DG’s office in Ado Ekiti on Wednesday. Ojo-Lanre said that the administration of Gov. Fayemi was keenly
interested in reawakening the cultural heritage of Ekiti people. He noted that the gesture would help save the state’s culture and heritage from total extinction. The D-G said that the state government was ready to collaborate with
the curator of Genesis Gallery in its quest to revamp the state’s
cultural heritage. He added that the state would also be willing to discover and train
up-and-coming artists with a view to making them become master artists. Also, the Curator of Genesis Arts Gallery, Oshogbo, Osun , Mr
Adeyinka Fabayo, said that art works were not only for decoration but an
investment. Fabayo appealed to the government to support the industry by creating an enabling environment for it to strive. Similarly, the former Commissioner for Home Affairs, Culture and
Tourism in Osun, Dr Obawale Adebisi, said that the state was ready to
establish a harmonious relationship with Ekiti State at revamping Ekiti
cultural values. The Permanent Secretary of the Council, Alhaji Ibrahim Ganiyu, said
that there would be no bureaucratic   bottlenecks in attending to the
needs of the arts industry.
