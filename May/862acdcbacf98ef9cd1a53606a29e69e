In what is now becoming an annual ritual, the coercive agents of the Nigerian state are in an overdrive mode as they scramble to “stop” the IPOB and other pro-Biafran groups from observing their annual Biafran Heroes Day which they do by sitting at home! Deploying the same argument underpinning the refusal to grant a referendum, agents of the Nigerian state argue that the May 30th Biafran Heroes Day is illegal and lacks constitutional validity! Therefore, anyone obeying the call is, at best, committing some kind of misdemeanor, or at worst, an “enemy of the state”! But is this argument really logical? In a constitutional democracy, where does the residual, legislative and constitutional powers lie? Who, is even the state? Are the coercive organs of the state (and the puppeteers that control them) the state? Or is the people, in their unardoned pristinity that are the state? And if the people are the state (our proposition), then the wish of the people must prevail! Even if the people decide that it’s in their best interest to walk into the Red Sea (or the Southern Atlantic), it’s their will! Again, why is the Nigerian state terrified of the Biafrans keeping their memories alive? Is their some earthshaking evil or horror that was committed in the act of “keeping Nigeria one” that the state wants to erase from the consciousness of the people? Simply put, why is the Nigerian state a memory killer? How does a simple day of tribute celebrated without fanfare, without fireworks, without martial parades, just a sit-at-home, terrify the Nigerian juggernaut so much? Life is identity, and identity is wrapped up in our memories. Whoever takes our money, property, even our life, has only scratched at gross matter effluvia, but whoever takes away our memories has destroyed our essence, in fact he has taken our soul! May the memory killers not be triumphant! Source: Facebook
