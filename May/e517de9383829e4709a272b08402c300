By Michael Kuria That would be the deep throated politician. But seriously, this is a very interesting question. The most venomous snake in Africa is the boomslang (Dispholidus typus). It is so venomous that the amount of venom it requires to kill a grown man is so tiny that it can hardly be seen with the naked eye. Here is the gorgeous little fella Cute bitey Nope-Rope However it is not the most dangerous snake in Africa. Wait, what?!! Well, you see the most venomous snake is not automatically the most dangerous snake. First the Boomslang is rare, it also avoids human beings and thirdly it has very primitive venom glands which do not always release the venom. In fact the snake has to put in several bites before it can release the venom. Usually, you would get out of there in a hurry after the first bite. It is also a small snake so the bites will be in the limbs which can be amputated or a torniquet applied. The most dangerous snake in Africa is the black Mamba. He just wants to be your friend. Say hello to this fella. The black mamba is bigger, faster, aggressive, more venom and will normally strike the chest. Also very common across Africa. Luckily I live in the cold highlands and have no likelihood of meeting any of these nope-ropes with teeth. I wish you denizens of the hot lowlands all the best. PS: Black Mamba is also the brand name of a popular bicycle. So if someone offers you a ride on his black mamba don’t be too surprised. Of course “black Mamba” can also refer to a notorious part of the human anatomy. Whichever the case, all the best. Enjoy. Source: Quora
