LUSAKA – Zambia says its decision to punish miner Vedanta’s local operation for breaching environmental and financial regulations is a signal to other firms to follow the law, mines minister Richard Musukwa said on Thursday. Vedanta is fighting Zambia’s decision this month to name a provisional liquidator to run Vedanta Resources’ 90,000 tonnes Konkola Copper Mines business. Reuters)
