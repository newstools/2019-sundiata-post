It is obvious that Magu has a personal issue with Saraki. If not, Saraki left office EIGHT years ago but Magu in 2019, wants to open fresh charges and look at “old books”. That is not the issue. Aregbesola left office six months ago and he has petition against him but Magu’s EFCC does not have time for that one. Oshiomohole has almost water-tight evidence against him on how he ran Edo State, Magu is blind to that. Yes, we admit that the length of time does not vitiate criminal act. In other words, no matter how long, anyone could be called to account. But we know why Magu is after Saraki: his inability to get Senate confirmation. But the guy is picking the wrong person. Go after DSS that wrote a damning report on you Mr.! Beyond that, you surely knew where the report came from. Under Magu, EFCC is only good at running after opposition figures. And I hope anything will be left of the Commission by the time this guy leaves office. Olodo…
