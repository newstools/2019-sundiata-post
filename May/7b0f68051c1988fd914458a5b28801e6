Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Former minister of Aviation and chieftain of
the Peoples Democratic Party, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, has alleged that Fulani
Jihadists and herdsmen have infiltrated the South West with pre-meditated
intention. The former Minister alleged that the arsonists infiltrated the
region with the aim of attacking its people when given the order. In a tweet, the
former Minister claimed they intended attacking the South West, while the
people of the region were busy engaging in internal squabble. He wrote: “As the South West continues to engage in its petty internal
rivalries and endless squabbles the Fulani jihadists, in the guise of cattle
rearers and herdsmen, have successfully infiltrated their land. “These deadly
sleeper cells are ready to strike and create havoc when ordered to do so.” Just few days ago, a pan Yoruba socio-cultural group, Yoruba Koya Leadership and Training Foundation had raied alarm over alleged taking over of states  in the South West region by people suspected to be herdsmen. The group called on the governors to rise above partisan interest and take
actions aimed towards safeguarding their people against internal and external
aggressions, stressing that posterity and history would never forgive any of
them who, for the sake of party politics, stare helplessly while their land is
annexed. This group had
said, “We say with all sense of responsibility and without any fear or
intimidation devoid of sensationalism that the entire Yoruba Land has been
encircled by external criminals masquerading as Herdsmen. Empirical
Intelligence available to us has it that these criminals who are mainly from
Kebbi, Katsina, Kano, Sokoto and some West African Countries, are being dropped
daily in Yoruba Land by Heavy Duty Trucks.”
