By Cecilia Ologunagba Abuja – An Economist, Dr Aminu Usman has advised the Federal Government to accelerate implementation of infrastructural projects captured in the 2019 budget to boost economic development in the country. Usman, the Head of Economics Department, Kaduna State University gave
the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on
Monday in Abuja. He said that government should expedite the implementation of its key
infrastructural projects that had direct bearing on cost of production
and production efficiency within the private sector. In addition, Usman said government should also ensure adequate supply
of food by releasing from its stock pile of agricultural products
spread across various storage silos. “This will in a way make food items available and at a relatively lower price. “It will curtail the ability of middlemen to jack-up prices due to
short in supply and the expected additional income that could go to food
purchases,’’ he said. The Senate passed the 2019 Appropriation Bill of N8.92 trillion on April 30. The budget was increased by the legislature by N90 billion from the
N8.83 trillion presented by President Muhammadu Buhari on Dec. 18, 2018. The Statutory Transfer stood at N502 billion, Fiscal Deficit-N1.9
trillion, Special Intervention N500 billion, Recurrent Expenditure N4
trillion, Capital Expenditure-N2 trillion and Deficit to Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) of 1.37 per cent.
