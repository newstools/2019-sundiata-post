By Ige AdekunleSango-Ota – The Ogun Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has advised applicants who applied for driver’s licence to go to the nearest centre, as unclaimed licences are about 11,423. Mr Clement Oladele, the Ogun Sector Commander of FRSC, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota, Ogun, on Monday. Oladele said the advice became necessary as the number of unclaimed driver’s licences was on the increase due to non-challant attitude of applicants in Ogun. The commander listed some of the centres as FRSC Office, Housing Area, Abeokuta and Federal Inland Revenue Office, Sango-Ota, beside Ado-Odo/Ota,Local Government. “We are appealing to applicants to ensure that they go to the nearest centre in the state to check whether their licences are ready,’’ he said. He also said that any driver or motorist caught without driver licence would be fined and the vehicle would be impounded. “The FRSC will continue to arrest erring drivers and ensure sanity on our highways,’’ he said. Oladele also noted the commitment of the FRSC to intensify intensive public enlightenment campaign to sensitise motorists on the importance of having driver’s licence and safety on the highways
