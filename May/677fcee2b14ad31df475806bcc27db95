Popular Nigerian Instagram blogger, Blessing Okoro has claimed that Onye Eze, the real owner of the house which she claimed she built on her birthday sent his boys to arrest her and not the Police. In a new video which she appeared in, Blessing Okoro claims Onye Eze called her to invite her to his house, she had no idea what was going to happen there but on getting there, his boys arrested her and handcuffed her. She says no Police officer did that to her but his boys. The BOM CEO explained the ordeal she went through amidst tears. She blames Onye Eze and his boys for what she is being put through on social media. She went on to say her life is being threatened. Blessing likened what she was going through on the internet to death and therefore she prefers speaking up about this ordeal than staying silent as she is being murdered on the internet. See the new video she made on Instagram below. Watch the videos below: Blessing CEO said she was not arrested.
