By Sapna Roy Yes! Germany has the lowest unemployment rates in EU. There are plenty of jobs, you just need to speak German. The country has a shortage of skilled labors and this is also a reason that they provide free education to international students. They want international students to come over, study, learn language and work in their country. If you are well supported with great academics, have experience & comfortable with German language then this country certainly has job opportunities for you.
