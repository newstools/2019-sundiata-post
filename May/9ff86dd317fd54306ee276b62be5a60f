By Steve Paul I’ve worked with and managed European teams over past 30 years. Here’s what I have learned: True Cultural Story I: I once made a restaurant order in the Netherlands and requested it be cooked a certain way. The server came back right away with message from the chef. “The chef doesn’t appreciate being told how to cook the food.” Never argue with anyone preparing your food. This answer is not possible in the USA.
True Cultural Story II: I once asked in a Belgian sandwich shop, in a neutral voice, what was in a particular sandwich. I was told “you can read the ingredients for yourself.” Another answer not possible in the USA.
True Cultural Story III (added): I got in a taxi in Utrecht, the Netherlands. The taxis driver had two meters in the cab. The fare meter was obvious. I was puzzled about the second meter, and asked what it was. The driver explained: “I must take scheduled breaks. That meter tracks my work time. I cannot work more than 35 hours per week or I am fined.” So I said, somewhat in shock: “If you come to the USA to work, we’ll let you work as many hours as you want.” Service in Europe is very different than USA. Every trip to Europe, I learn something new. Employment is more regulated in Europe versus USA which also has regulations but fewer than Europe. Americans value Economics over Quality of Life; Europeans value Quality of Life. Source: Quora
