By Vivian Ibobo Ikeja – A business woman, Abimbola Akinyemi, 47, on Friday appeared in an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly obtaining N2.685 million under false pretence. Akinyemi, residing at Akute in Ogun, is charged with fraud, stealing
and issuance of dud cheque, to which she pleaded not guilty. The Prosecutor, Insp. Victor Eruada, told the court that Akinyemi
committed the offences sometime in 2018 at Unique Shopping Mall, Work
Road, Ikeja. Eruada said that the defendant obtained N2.685 million from Wanga-Fix
Global Integrated, under the pretext of expanding their business for
them. “When the company did not get any feedback from the defendant the company decided to ask for a refund of the money. “The company said that after so much persistence, the defendant
issued a cheque of N1.312 million and told them to withdraw the money
from her First Bank account. Eruada said that when the cheque was presented at the bank, it was dishonored, due to a lack of funds in the account. “The case was reported to the police and the defendant was arrested,’’ he said. The prosecutor said the offences contravened the provisions of
Sections 287, 314 and 321 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Magistrate M. I. Dan-Oni admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Dan-Oni said that the sureties must be gainfully employed and must show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She adjourned the case until June 19 for mention.
