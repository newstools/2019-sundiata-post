In 2013, when Obasanjo wrote his now infamous letter to Jonathan, many hailed him and said: “As a former President, he should know what he is talking about.” They added: “Forget the messenger. Focus on the message.” I remember those who fell into the category of the Obasanjo-was-right then. They were APC/Buhari supporters. Fast-forward to 2019. Obasanjo said plan was afoot to islamise and ‘fulanise’ (Nigeria’s latest addition to the English lexicon) the country. Now, majority of those who took Obasanjo to the cleaners in 2013 are the ones hailing him today. Here them again: “Obasanjo has seen it all. He should know what he was saying.” Who are those ABUSING Obasanjo today? Same Buhari/APC supporters who HAILED him when he wrote his sniper letter in 2013. Who are those HAILING Obasanjo? They are PDP/GEJ/Atiku supporters who ABUSED him 2013! IF OBASANJO WAS WRONG IN 2013, CAN HE BE RIGHT NOW? OR IF HE WAS RIGHT IN 2013, COULD HE BE WRONG NOW? Moral:
Nigerians believe stories based on their EMOTIONS. It is hardly based on raw facts and empirical derivatives. And it was not like this before. It started when some fraudulent salesmen started selling us fake product in 2014 till 2015. When they told us that firemen are the same with soldiers since they both wear uniform. Source: Facebook
