It has been in the forefront to bring to the minimum level the situation of poverty affecting Nigerians. The theme for this year’s celebration is: “Media for Democracy: Journalism and Elections in Times of Disinformation”. The JAP coordinator, who tasked the
government to provide more information for citizens during election
period, added that the information should be provided through
transparency and accountability to the people. Elekolusi said that the JAP
initiative would be ready to partner with the Nigerian government to
tackle corruption and reduce poverty to the minimum level among the
citizens. He said that the fundamental
objective of the group was to create room for issues on development to
be discussed, written and to amplify the voice of the citizens to know
their rights. The Press Freedom Day is a global celebration for journalists around the world marked globally on May. The day has been designated by the
United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to raise awareness of the
importance of freedom of the press. It is also to remind governments of
their duty to respect and uphold the right to freedom of expression
enshrined under Article 19 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. Freedom of the press is the
principle that communication and expression through various media,
printed and electronic media, especially published materials, should be
considered a right to be exercised freely.
