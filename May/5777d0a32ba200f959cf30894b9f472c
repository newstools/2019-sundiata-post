A popular Islamic cleric, Hammed Ademola, has waded into the marital crisis between Tonto Dikeh and her estranged husband, Olakunle Churchill. Recall that Tonto was all over the news in the past weeks after claiming that her husband is a 40-seconds man. She also accused him of being diabolic and an internet fraudster. However, Ademola while reacting to the story, said that Tonto will never get married again. According to him, Tonto did not want to marry someone on her level but she wanted to be with a wealthy person. Also, he added that a wife should not have called out her own husband in that manner. Conclusively, the cleric declared that the actress will never get married again for disgracing Churchill. Video below: Source
