By Ibrahim.abdulazeez Iseyin – Pupils of various primary schools in Oyo State on Tuesday stayed away from their schools as the strike embarked upon by their teachers continued. Primary school teachers in the state had on Monday commenced an indefinite industrial action to press home their demands. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the demands include
better welfare for members, payment of promotion arrears and payment of
primary school pensioners. They are also complaining of  delay in salary payment and non-payment of leave bonus and car grants. NAN correspondent who went round various schools in Iseyin  Council
area of the state on Tuesday reports that public primary schools were
under lock. Some of the primary schools visited include Community Primary School,
Oja-Agbe, Army Children School, Barracks area, Community Primary
school, Oke-Esa, and Baptist Primary School, Koso. Mr Samson Adedoyin, the Chairman of the Nigerian Union of Teachers
(NUT) in Oyo State, had told NAN on Monday in Ibadan that the strike
became inevitable when dialogue with the state government failed. Mr Niyi Akano, the immediate past chairman of NUT, on his part, had stated that only primary school teachers were on strike. He, however, said if the state government failed to address the demands, teachers in secondary schools would join in solidarity. Akano had said the industrial action would remain indefinite until the demands were met.
