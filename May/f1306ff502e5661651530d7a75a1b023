By Abiemwense Moru Abuja – A member of the House of Representatives, Rep.Johnson Agbonayinma (APC-Edo), has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for keeping to his promise by signing the N30,000 new minimum wage bill into law. Agbonayinma made the commendation in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Abuja. He said that the President who promised to sign the National Minimum Wage Bill into law, made good his promise by assenting to it. He also commended the National Assembly and the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) for their struggle to actualise the minimum wage. “I believe we will find the need for State Governors to implement the new law,” he said. Agbonayinma questioned the issue of contract labour which according to him, must be stopped. “We must work toward that as Nigerian workers must be engaged where they are able to get benefits. “Contract labour by parastatals, ministries, multinational companies and banks employing graduates as contract staff is a fraud,”he said. (NAN)
