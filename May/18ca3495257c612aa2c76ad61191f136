An Instagram user has revealed how the marriage of Regina Daniels‘ mother crashed. She made this known while debunking reports that 59-year old billionaire Ned Nwoko is the biological father of actress Regina Daniels whom he just got “married” to. According to the IG user, the biological father of Regina Daniels is a man who kicked her mother out when she ventured into acting. She wrote: @precious_ag_ please don’t say what you don’t know mbok. Regina’s biological father is from Ogwuashi Uku… The same quarters with late Peter Burnor whose son is rumored to b Regina’s boyfriend. The dad didn’t marry her traditionally… When Regina’s my ventured into acting that was the Genesis of the marriage crash… She had four kids for the man… Be properly informed… Saw her yesterday at midwifery market and damn Stella she is glowing.
