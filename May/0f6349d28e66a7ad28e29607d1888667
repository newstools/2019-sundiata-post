The way Shatta Wale and Stonebwoy are causing trouble in this country, you would think they are the only two people who exist. Everywhere you turn, they are making headlines. If there’s any comparable duo to the two in Nigeria, then it has to be Tonto Dikeh and Bobrisky. Tonto is a real Shatta who is always trending on social media due to her troublesome nature and Bobrisky is just fascinating to follow. The two troublemakers luckily have a personal relationship which is completely out of the norm. One is a man-woman, a woman trying so hard to be a man and calling herself ‘King Tonto‘. The other is a woman-man, a man who has decided to become a woman. Some time ago they were spotted kissing each other in a photo which went viral. We’ve now spotted another photo of the two of them and this time, they’re decked out in bathrobes just hanging out. Such an iconic duo.
