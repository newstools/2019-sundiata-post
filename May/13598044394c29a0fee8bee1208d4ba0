By Ige Adekunle Sango-Ota – A 37-year-old man, Adebowale Anjorin, on Friday appeared in an Ota Magistrates’ Court in Ogun, for allegedly defrauding a man of N550,000. Anjorin, whose address was not provided, is facing a three-count
charge of fraud, obtaining money under false pretences and conspiracy. He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Abdulkareem Mustapha, told the court that the
defendant committed the offences with some other persons still at large
on Sept. 15, 2013 at Okoewe, Ijagba Estate, Itele, Ota. Mustapha said the defendant collected the N550,000 from the
complainant, Mr Kazeem Nasiru, that he would sell him a plot of land, a
representation he knew was false. He said that the offences contravened sections 390(9), 419 and 516 of the Criminal Law of Ogun, 2006. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Mathew Akinyemi, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. Akinyemi ordered that the sureties should reside within the court’s
jurisdiction and should show evidence of tax payments to Ogun
Government. The case was adjourned until June 3, for continuation.
