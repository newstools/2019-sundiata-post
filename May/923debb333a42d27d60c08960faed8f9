Not many people are aware that Kingsley Chinweike Okonkwo popularly known by his stage name, KCee, has become a prayer warrior. These days, before the Limpopo master settles down to do anything, he embarks on a prayer session that can last for several minutes, depending on his mood at that particular point in time. And the divorced 40 years old Anambra State-born singer cum businessman has also recently made a habit of showering prayers on his teeming fans almost on a daily basis via his various social media accounts. On Sunday, KCee offered this prayer: “The Lord that brought water out of the rock will open the doors of unimaginable blessings this new week and beyond. If you believe say a big Amen.” And some days before then he had offered prayerfully, “May your life be as colourful as you want it the rest of this year. If you believe say a big Amen.” This new divine passion of the bearded singer, we learnt, has become a regular feature in his life. Methinks all that his fans need to do is to also return prayers for this sensuous composer and performer of love songs to graduate to a gospel artiste soon. If you believe say a loud Amen too. Praise the Lord!
