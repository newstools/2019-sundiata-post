By Michael Agyeman I am Ghanaian. I get the feeling Nigerians see us as being smaller brothers, slightly dumber and more clean cut, less street-wise than they are themselves. Kind of like Americans see Canadians. There is a lot of respect between the two nations and a lot of closeness, even though there are two countries between us, but Nigeria is bigger, richer and so more influential and as such the average Nigerian feels bigger than the average Ghanaian, but not in an offensive way.
