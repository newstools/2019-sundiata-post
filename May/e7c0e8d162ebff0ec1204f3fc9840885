By Sani Abdulrahman Kaduna – The Chief Imam of Maiduguri Road Central Mosque, Kaduna, Sheik Dahiru Lawal, has urged Muslims to be cheerful givers and pray for peace in Nigeria during the holy month of Ramadan. Lawal, who gave the advice while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kaduna on Monday, said cheerful givers received multiple blessings. He said Ramadan was characterised by quick answers to prayers, adding that giving would also make prayers to be answered and strengthen the faith of unbelievers in their environment. “It is good for every Muslim to extend the giving hands to the needy, neighbours, friends and families who are in need. “When we show love to people around us through giving, this will make Allah to bless us. “Give to the needy and don’t be selfish. Prophet Muhammad is neither selfish nor greedy, When you don’t give to the needy around you, it means you are mocking them.” The Imam also stressed that Ramadan period was known as a season of giving, therefore every Muslim must demonstrate a pure heart of giving. According to him, every Muslim that is financially buoyant is expected to give charity to the needy and strengthen his role toward moving closer to his Creator. He called on Muslims to use the opportunity of the Ramadan to pray for Nigeria and the leaders. (NAN)
