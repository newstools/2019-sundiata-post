Ex- Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo has been spotted, looking adorn as he steps out in a suit. He may be an old man, but Olusegun Obasanjo sure knows how to look dapper. The former Nigerian president was seen in Vietnam looking awesome as he rocks a suit while stepping out for an engagement. Obasanjo is usually seen rocking traditional garbs but this time, he has given a suit a try far away from his native county. Photos: Source:tori.ng
