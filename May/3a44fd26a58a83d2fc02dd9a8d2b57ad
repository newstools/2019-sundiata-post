By Brett Rosen I was at an organizational meeting this week and my bosses bosses boss got on stage and at one point mentioned that when you work for an international company like ours your day and meetings start at 6:30 am. I was sitting there laughing to myself and thinking “Wow my meetings don’t start at 6:30. In fact I block off 7–8am every day with fake meetings to make sure nobody schedules one that early.” In corporate land the higher you go up the chain the more you work or as someone else described it. “They own a little bit more of you with every promotion” I don’t live in the meetings start at 6:30 am world. I don’t want to live in that world but if you started bumping me up the corporate ladder I would be giving that same speech. So in general my observational view is yeah more income = more work. This makes particular sense given some part of the lowest quintile is underemployed working less than 40 hours a week when they prefer full time. There is some data to back this up see. “By 2002, the best-paid 20 percent were twice as likely to work long hours as the bottom 20 percent. In other words, the prosperous are more likely to be at work more than those earning little.” What is interesting is this didn’t used to be the case. From the same article “In 1983, the most poorly paid 20 percent of workers were more likely to put in long work hours than the top paid 20 percent. ” They go on to posit some different theories on why. Personally I have my own theory. I suspect you can blame the blackberry and technology. Higher earners are much more tethered to their jobs than they were in 1980. At one time working long hours meant being in the office. Now it may mean answering emails at 11pm in bed. Lower income workers aren’t typically tethered to corporate phones in the same way so when they go home they are done. Source: Quora
