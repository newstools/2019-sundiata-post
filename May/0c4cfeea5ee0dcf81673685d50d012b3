The Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai yesterday said the Nigerian Army acquired property in Abuja since 1978 to address infrastructural shortfall in the Service. Buratai spoke during the groundbreaking and foundation laying ceremony for the construction of ‘Army Command Estate and Headquarters Directorate of Legal Services’ at Muhammadu Buhari Cantonment on Airport Road, Giri. Reacting to protest of FCT indigenous people over displacement from the property, Buratai said the land was duly acquired and fully documented by the Army. He said, “We are undertaking these developmental projects for the professionalism of the Nigerian Army, this particular project was officially granted to the Nigerian Army in 1979.” “We got official allocation with Right of Occupancy (R of O) in 1997 by the Federal Capital Administration and 2011 when all lands were revoked, and all owners of land were directed to rectify,” he added. “The Nigerian Army along with other services, the Navy and Air Force duly applied for recertification and paid the dues that were meant and got our acknowledgement,” he said. “If anybody has complain on this land, let them approach the appropriate authorities as we legally and timely recertified the land after revocation of allocations in 2011,” he stated. He asked aggrieved parties not to take laws into their hands as any act of unlawful incursion will not be tolerated. Buratai also restated the commitment of the Army to defend democracy, chargingArmy commanders to think outside the box to surmount the lingering insecurity. He said, “Our country must be united and remain secured, we must defend democracy, we are much betteroff during democracy than any other system.”
