By Ibironke Ariyo  Abuja – Vanguard Against Drug Abuse (VGADA), an NGO, has launched a national campaign to tackle the menace of drug abuse among youths, children and women. The President of the organisation, Dr Hope Abraham, disclosed this in a telephone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Abuja. Abraham said that the campaign, tagged “Nigeria kicks against drug misuse”, was officially launched on May 8 in Benue. He said the campaign was to raise the level of awareness of the inherent dangers of drug abuse to discourage youths who were the prime victims of the practice. “The project is also a way of presenting a united front against the menace which had eaten deep into the society. “The alarming rate at which incidences of drug abuse had permeated the society in recent time is worrisome. The trend calls for caution and needs serious action from government and all stakeholders. “The engagement approach will be held with stakeholders to deliberate on the menace and proffer likely intervention to tackle it holistically. “Stakeholders will include parents, youths, patent medicine sellers, pharmacists, commercial drivers and commercial motorcyclists, among others. “No one will be left out in this fight as we have come up with various strategies which will ensure that youths who are the most vulnerable are reached. “Their health and optimal development is critical to national development and deserves significant attention,” he said. Abraham explained that various approaches involving events, engagements and awareness using schools and communities, would be employed for maximum results. “The approaches to be used will be centred on what youths like to watch and listen to,” he said. He urged mosques, churches and other religious bodies to dedicate time to enlighten worshippers on drug abuse and canvass support for the fight against the menace.
