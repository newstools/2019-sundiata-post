The commander said everybody was a leader in his own calling and must join the commission in its campaign for safety to reduce high rate of road crashes. ” Safety is paramount in everything and everybody must speak up. Leaders must enact special laws to prevent consistent road crashes. ” Young and innocent Nigerians are dying everyday on the roads, it is  time for our leaders to be like you, Journalists, Teachers, Religious leaders, Lawyers, Drivers and Artisans to speak out in one voice to protect souls. ” An occupant of a vehicle has a right to caution drivers while driving wrecklessly. Don’t keep mute when someone endangers your life,” he said. According to him, over 1.35million souls are lost on road crashes  every year all over the world, which deserve special attention. The commander also said the United Nations week was aimed at  maintaining safer roads, safer vehicles and safer road users for safety purposes.

Let’s join hands and be a road safety campaigner,” he said. (NAN)
