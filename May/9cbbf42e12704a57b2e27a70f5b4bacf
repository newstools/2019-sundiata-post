Damilola Adegbite looks perfect in her birthday photo which is getting impressive reviews online. The screengoddess in a professional photoshoot was pictured in a skimpy and body-hugging black gown which showcased her lovely and luscious skin. “This is what 34 years of my life looks like. My heart is full. So full. #God’s favorite child,” she captioned the picture. She seems to be celebrating her birthday on a lowkey, maybe due to the tragedy that befell her ex-husband, Chris Attoh whose new American wife was shot dead by an assassin in the U.S.
