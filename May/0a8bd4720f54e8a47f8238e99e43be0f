By Deborah AkpedeIkeja, May 30, 2019 (NAN) For allegedly stealing his employer’s N468,000, a 35-year-old filling station manager, Abiodun Ojugbele, was on Thursday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. Ojugbele, a resident of Sango in Ogun, was charged on one count. The defendant committed the offence on May 15 at Allinco Filling Station, Ijaiye, Lagos, the prosecutor, Insp. Josephine Ikhayere, alleged. She said that the money belonged to Mr Sule Kolawole. Ikhayere said that Kolawole noticed reduction in proceeds and requested for the account book from where he discovered that the defendant stole the amount. “The complainant (Kolawole) discovered changes in the litres of petrol and kerosene sold. “When questioned, the defendant could not give a satisfactory answer. He was handed over to the police,” the prosecutor said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that stealing from one’s employer contravenes Section 287 (7) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, which prescribes three years’ jail term for the offence. Following his plea of not guilty, the Magistrate, Mrs O.O. Ekundayo, released the defendant on bail of N100,000 with two sureties in like sum. Ekundayo said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Substantive hearing has been fixed for June 13.
