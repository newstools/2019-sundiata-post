The Ivorians took the lead in the 43rd minute of the encounter when Spain–based Ange Koko N’Guessan, who also scored for the Dame Elephantes against Mali in the semi-final, beat goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie with a marvellous free–kick. Afterwards, the African champions created several chances without making hay. It was left to leggy forward Uchenna Kanu, the USA–based student, to draw Nigeria level in the fourth minute of added time in the second half. In the penalty shoot-out, Amarachi Okoronkwo, Maryam Ibrahim, Alice Ogebe, Joy Bokiri and captain Evelyn Nwabuoku made no mistake from the spot, while the Ivorians lost one of their kicks. The Falcons had also won their semi-final match against Ghana after a penalty shoot-out, 4-2. The African champions scored 23 goals in the tournament, conceding only two. They thrashed Burkina Faso 5-1, annihilate the Niger Republic 15-0, defeated Mali 2-0 and defeated Ghana on penalties after a 0-0 draw. The Nigeria delegation will fly into Abuja on Sunday afternoon. Former junior international Uchenna Kanu finished the tournament with nine goals. Chiamaka Nnadozie, Alaba Jonathan and Christy Ohiaeriaku, defenders Evelyn Nwabuoku and Chidinma Okeke, midfielder Amarachi Okoronkwo and forward Alice Ogebe, will fly to Austria on Monday evening for Nigeria’s pre-World Cup final camp, with technical and administrative staff. All overseas-based professionals will travel directly to the Avita Resort camp in Austria.
