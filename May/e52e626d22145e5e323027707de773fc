By Adepote ArowojobeIkorodu -. A 25-year-man, Nelson Chidi, appeared at an Ikorodu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State on Tuesday for allegedly obtaining N1.25m under false pretence. Chidi, who is of no fixed address, is facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and obtaining money by false pretence. The Prosecutor, Sgt. John Iberedem, told the court that the defendant committed the offences around 2017 in Ikorodu. Iberedem said that Chidi fraudulently obtained N1.25 million from one Ben Adedokun, a cleric under pretence of establishing a business and to refund the money within six month to the complainant. The prosecutor said, however, that the representation made by Chidi was discovered to be false. He said that the defendant at the same time and date converted the N1.25m to his personal use without the consent of the owner. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the offences contravene Sections 314 and 280(f) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against him. The Chief Magistrate, Mr A.F. Azeez, granted the accused bail in the sum of N350, 000 with two sureties in like sum and adjourned the case until June 20 for mention.
