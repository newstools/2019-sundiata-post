Let me repeat: I have NOTHING against the choice this Regina Daniel girl made. It is her life. Can only wish her the best she wishes herself. However, I learnt TWO major lessons about our society from the whole saga. One: Our society is ACTUALLY MATERIALISTIC than I initially thought. When money is involved, there are no values many of us can not compromise. Forget the FAKE social media moral posturings, most of our ladies who preach against polygamy and faithfulness in marriage won’t mind their daughter becoming SIXTH wife to Dangote! Two: The other lesson is the hypocrisy of some if not most of our ladies. Some of them will fight dirty if their hubbies greet any sister too much in their church. If their hubbies become too close to their sisters who happen to be their own sisters-in-law, there will be war. In a nutshell, they can NEVER stomach their hubbies having a girlfriend not to talk of second wife. Yet, they are the ones making posts defending Regina. Why? Because MONEY is involved. Same ladies who nearly pulled down social media over the young girl married off in Delta and who ensured they “rescued” the girl are now the ones defending Regina. Why? Ned is RICH. The Delta man is POOR. Hypocrisy, thy name is Nigerian… Source: Facebook
