By Didier Champion It is wrong to call Rwanda, the Switzerland of Africa. Why can’t we be the Rwanda of Africa? There is no need to be obsessed with European countries. As a country, Rwanda has shown that African countries can stand on their own with their leaders, without any foreign people telling them what to do and how to do it. We don’t need to be the Singapore of Africa, the Luxembourg of Africa, the Switzerland of Africa, we are Rwanda, an African countrywith a beautiful future. That’s enough for me. We are a united, peaceful, and progressive country. Source: Quora
