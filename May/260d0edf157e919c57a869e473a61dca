By Taiye Olayemi Lagos – Mr Sanjay Srivastava, President, Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party (OFBJP), Nigeria chapter, on Thursday urged Indians in Nigeria to participate in their country’s elections later in May. OFBJP is a non-governmental organisation involved in community development in Nigeria and promoting Indians’ common course. Srivastava said that Indians resident in Nigeria should show some sense of patriotism and vote for their desired candidates. According to him, this is another opportunity to further liberate themselves from 70 years of stagnation and frustration. He said that Indians in Nigeria should endeavour to travel home and
cast their votes as this would go a long way in ensuring that their
candidates won the elections. Srivastava noted that Dr Vijay Chauthaiwale, the global Convener of
OFBJP had been addressing Indians in diaspora online to ensure that
every Indian defied distance barrier to cast his vote. “I implore Indians resident in Nigeria to take out time from their
busy schedule and ensure we all participate in the voting process. “Our incumbent Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, must be re-elected to
ensure continuity of the good works he has been doing for the past five
years,” he said. Srivastava said that India had experienced sporadic transformation in
virtually all aspects of its economy which had spread through to the
grassroots and the urban settlements. According to him, this must be maintained to secure a brighter future for the children and generations to come. “This is only possible if we make our votes count. I know when we
turnout en mass, we will get positive result; we must all be committed
to this. “Modi is such a leader that works for 18 hours out of the 24 hours in
a day, still a bachelor and selfless, highly responsible and
discourages nepotism,” he said. Modi, a.k.a NAMO, is India’s 14th Prime Minister. He assumed office in 2014.
