Zainab Aliyu, a Nigerian previously detained in Saudi Arabia for alleged drug trafficking, has returned to the country after spending four months in detention. Aliyu had been detained in the Arab country since December when she was arrested at the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International Airport in Medina because tramadol, a banned drug was found in her bag. She arrived in Nigeria through the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport in Kano on Monday in the company of Ibrahim Abubakar, another Nigerian accused of the same crime. Aliyu, a 22-year-old student of the Maitama Sule University in Kano, had travelled to Saudi Arabia for lesser hajj alongside her mother and sister. She was arrested by Saudi police authorities over allegations that the bag bearing her name tag contained tramadol. Her arrest had led to the discovery of an alleged drug cartel at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport that reportedly transferred her excess luggage weight to bag that contained tramadol. She was released to the Nigerian mission in Saudi Arabia after the federal government made efforts to investigate and establish their innocence. It was reported that the 7-man syndicate specialise in planting banned drugs in travellersâ€™ luggage to export the substances to Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries. Source
