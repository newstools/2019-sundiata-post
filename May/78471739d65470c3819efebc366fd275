As earlier reported by Sundiata Post, a 46-year-old businessman, Mr Tochi Michael, has dragged Justice Tanko Muhammad, the acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, before a Federal Capital Territory High Court over alleged age falsification. The originating summons with suit No. FCT/HC/BW/CV/79/2019, filed before the court in April, the petitioner alleged that the CJN deliberately falsified his date of birth. Meanwhile Nigerians are demanding on social media that the same treatment that was meted to Former CJN Justice Walter Onnoghen be done to Tanko Mohammed. Justice Onnoghen was suspended by the Federal Government after allegations of failure to declare assets were leveled against him. Nigerians are demanding that same line be followed in this case until Tanko is proven innocent or otherwise. See Reactions below:
