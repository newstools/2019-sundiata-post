Harare – Zimbabwe’s state-owned power utility on Thursday warned it may ration electricity supplies as low water levels reduce output from its biggest hydro plant. The company also noted that aging coal-fired generators are shuttered or running at reduced capacity. Power cuts would hit the mining sector hardest being the sector which
contributes more than two thirds of Zimbabwe’s export earnings. It said this had added to difficulties in a country already grappling
with a lack of U.S. dollars, soaring prices and shortages of fuel, food
and medicines. The Southern African nation, which experienced its worst power
shortages in 2016 following a devastating drought, was producing 915 MW
on Thursday against peak demand of 2,100 MW. Kariba Power Station, which is already operating at half capacity,
will reduce generation further to 358 MW from 542 MW, Zimbabwe
Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) said in a
statement. Kariba has a generating capacity of 1,050 MW after another 300 MW was added in 2017. The drought had reduces water levels at the dam that feeds the plant. As Zimbabwe enters its peak winter power demand season, ZETDC told
companies and private households to reduce electricity consumption,
especially during periods of high demand. “In the event that this supply and demand equilibrium is not
maintained, the power utility would have no choice but to curtail some
loads to restore grid stability,” it said. Some residents in the capital Harare reported that they had already
been experiencing power cuts, known locally as load shedding, since the
beginning of this week. The utility said generation at Hwange, its biggest coal-fired
station, as well as three smaller plants remained fragile due to the age
of the facilities.
