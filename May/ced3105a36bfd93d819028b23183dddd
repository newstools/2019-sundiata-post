By Ayodeji Alabi Akure – Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Tuesday described revenue generation as the most important aspect of governance. Akeredolu said this in Akure during an induction programme for 234
new revenue officers of the Ondo State Internal Revenue Service. He explained that nothing could be done without revenue generation, as any government would be paralysed without it. “We felt that all problems would be solved with oil money, but it has
dawned on us that we must go back and generate revenue from other
sectors. “You cannot plan on expectations alone. Budgets and projections
depend on revenue, so everything we will do in this state depends on
you,” he told the revenue officers. The governor said there had been appreciable growth in the revenue base of the state since inception of his administration. According to Akeredolu, the internal revenue growth of the state
which was at 20th position before his administration came on board, is
now in the ninth position in Nigeria. “With your assistance, the growth should be more. We want to see an
increase in revenue of local governments because there are so many
leakages and it is for you to block them,” he said. Earlier, Mr Tolu Adegbie, Chairman, Ondo State Internal Revenue
Service, expressed gratitude to Akeredolu for the recruitment which, he
said, had boosted the strength of the personnel for effective coverage
of the State. He urged the recruits, who would be redeployed to the 18 local
governments of the state, to give their best, as they were brought in to
reinvigorate the service. According to the chairman, the governor had, once again, surpassed
all expectations because the recruitment was the single, largest
recruitment into the state Civil service in the last 10 years.
