By Gordon Miller Which car has an edge, Mercedes or Audi or BMW? Or are they at the same level? Having had 54 cars in 27 years including 11 BMWs and 8 Mercedes I can tell you that BMW is a far superior car. I have had nothing but problems with all my Mercedes. I love them when they are working, and the SL63 and SL65 were my favorites, but damn are they a nightmare to own. I finally got rid of everything and I have a 2017 BMW X5M. 567hp, 0–60 in 3.8 seconds. My oldest son drives a 2015 BMW M4, 485hp, 0–60 in 3.8 seconds. Both great cars. I have had every BMW M3 model from 1999–2008, some I liked so much I owned a coupe and convertible of the same model at the same time. Audi has made terrific progress over the last 10 years. Their acquisition by Volkswagon Group AG and subsequent other acquisitions of Lamborghini and other brands has given Audi access to better manufacturing techniques and more value. I hate to say it, but I would put BMW #1, Audi #2 and Mercedes #3 at this point. I love them all, but Audi is gunning for the top slot and they are getting very close to taking over the #1 position from BMW. With the Quattro all wheel drive and the introduction of S Line, R Line and RS cars, as well as a great product, there is a good chance that my next car will be an Audi R8 V10.
