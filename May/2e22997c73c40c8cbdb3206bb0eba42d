Abuja (Sundiata Post) – A masked gunman reportedly opened fire
at an east London mosque during Ramadan prayers a few hours ago. According to reports, some Muslims were at the Seven Kings
Mosque in Ilford for evening prayer when a gunshot was heard outside the
mosque. The gunman then gained entrance into the
mosque on High Road but was made to leave before he could fire another shot,Information
Nigeria has reported. Scotland Yard revealed that initial
investigations suggested that a “blank firing handgun” had been shot with no
injuries recorded. The investigation also revealed there was no damage done to
the building and the case is not been treated as terrorism-related, the force
said. Ibraheem Hussain, 19, who was at the
mosque at the time of the shooting said: “There’s three sections of the mosque
and at taraweeh (evening prayers) during this time of Ramadan the mosque is packed
out. We were upstairs in the classrooms and about 30 minutes into the night
prayer a large noise went off. “I just continued my prayer, it sounded
like a firework or maybe something heavy had been dropped, so no-one really
thought anything of it. After we finished we were leaving the shoe area and
someone said it was a gunshot, someone had come into the mosque and he had a
firearm on him. The managers had seen him, he was masked and acting suspicious
and the firearm was let off.” Following the incident the mosque’s
imam, Mufti Suhail, also said; “There was a firearm incident outside
Seven Kings Mosque tonight during Ramadan night prayers. The suspect ran from
the scene when stopped by brothers standing guard at the mosque. A shot was
fired which fortunately did not hit anyone.” Ilford North MP Wes Streeting speaking
on the incident tweeted; “I am aware of the reports of a man with
a firearm at Seven Kings Mosque during prayers tonight and am relieved that no
one appears to have been hurt or injured. Thank you to @MPSRedbridge for a
swift response.”
