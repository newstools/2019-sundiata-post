Duke and duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan have revealed first images of their baby boy. Holding the child wrapped in a white shawl, the couple gazed with excitement at the baby as they spoke with the media on Wednesday. Meghan said: “He has the sweetest temperament, he’s really calm. He’s been the dream.” They both laughed, Prince Harry then said: “I don’t know who he gets that from.” The birth of the baby, who is seventh in line to the throne, was announced on Monday. The royal couple have not revealed the name of their baby. They, however, said they would introduce their little boy to the Queen later on. Asked which parent the baby resembled more, Harry said: “Everyone says that babies change so much over two weeks. “We’re basically monitoring how the changing process happens over this next month really. But his looks are changing every single day, so who knows.” Source: qed.ng
