By Bengt Lindval Between the USA and Canada, in which one is easier to become a citizen after ending your studies? And which one accepts immigrants better? Let’s make the comparison: Cost of studying in USA, the highest on the globe. Cost of studying in Canada. Far less, often as much as 2/3 less. Visa progress: After you have completed your studies in USA, you are VERY likely to be told: “Congratulations on your degree. NOW LEAVE.” USA has a visa system that is very unfriendly to young and bright people.
Canada is EXACTLY the opposite, we welcome bright and well educated immigrants with open arms.
After you have completed a three year program AND recieved your diploma you are, almost automatically, given a work permit to stay and work anywhere in Canada. That permit can be converted to a Permanent Residence visa after as little as a few months. In turn, after you have been in Canada on your Permanent Residence visa for four years, you can become a citizen in as little as additional four years, not counting time away (important). USA will take your money and may leave with ONLY your degree, no job opportunites. Canada will educate you well AND offer you an opportunity to continue working and earning in your field of study. Which one accepts immigrants better? Silly question. USA is super immigrant intolerant/unfriendly. Look at how they even ban people from visiting… Canada is immigrant friendly to all and has the best immigration record in the world. We love bright and industrious persons, wherever they came from. (I think I already said that.) Welcome to Canada. Source: Quora
