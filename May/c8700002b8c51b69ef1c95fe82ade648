Former President Goodluck Jonathan has arrived in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he is expected to lead a team of observers in monitoring national and provincial elections in South Africa. The former president revealed this on Wednesday on his Facebook page. “I arrived in Johannesburg early this morning to lead the Election Observation Mission of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa to South Africa’s national and provincial elections. “Democracy has indeed turned the corner in Africa with many nations holding periodic and peaceful elections which put in the hands of the people the power to choose their leaders,” he wrote. Jonathan has been the toast of democracy in Africa since he conceded victory to Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Last year, Jonathan led observers to monitor elections in Sierra-Leone.
