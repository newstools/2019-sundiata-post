An eyewitness said Atiko was rushed to the Akwatia St. Dominic’s Hospital where doctors pronounced him dead after other soccer fans at the pub had tried but failed to revive him. Hebert was reportedly writing his final exams as of the time of the incident. He was staying in a rented apartment outside the school campus. The News Agency of Nigeria quoted the principal of Akwatia Technical Institution, Maxwel Owusu-Afriyie, as having told the Accra based radio station, Starr FM, that the incident is being investigated. Owusu-Afriyie said: “We will get the details and see if there was something the student did that suggests that his behaviour was in excess. “On that, we can really talk to the students. We have a system in place where we talk to the students and their behaviour these days.” Hebert is believed to be a teenager. Liverpool’s win over Barcelona on Tuesday has been ranked among one of the greatest comebacks in world football. They beat the Spanish champions despite losing the first leg 3-0. The victory has shocked many soccer fans, as Liverpool will now be playing in the Champions League final in Madrid for the second year in a row.NAN
