By Aman Estifanos Original Question :Did Africa have a written language before colonization? Huh…. Where do you think writing started? Let me just tell you of our own Ge’ez. Eritrea and Ethiopia still use it. Ge’ez (/ˈɡiːɛz/;ግዕዝ, Gəʿəz IPA: [ˈɡɨʕɨz] ( listen); also transliterated Giʻiz) is an ancient South Semitic language and a member of the Ethiopian Semitic group. The language originated in southern regions of Eritreaand the northern region of Ethiopia in the Horn of Africa. It later became the official language of the Kingdom of Aksum and Ethiopian imperial court. Today, Ge’ez remains only as the main language used in the liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Ethiopian Catholic Church, the Eritrean Catholic Church, and the Beta IsraelJewish community. However, in Ethiopia, Amharic (the main lingua franca of modern Ethiopia) or other local languages, and in Eritrea and Tigray Region in Ethiopia, Tigrinya may be used for sermons. Amharic, Tigrinya, and Tigreare closely related to Ge’ez. Source: Quora
