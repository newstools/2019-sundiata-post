Aachen – Over 12 animal right activists have occupied a slaughter house near the German city of Aachen, prompting a police operation, authorities said on Monday. The activists are protesting the slaughtering of animals which they claimed had negative impact on the climate. Around 30 activists took part in the sit-in in the town of Dueren overnight to Monday, police said. Police added that four activists had left the premises of their own will and had been arrested. “About 10 or 12 of them are blocking the driveway and there are other people on the roof,’’ said police spokesperson Carina Eickhoff, adding that some activists had chained themselves to the premises. The slaughter house will not be in operation for the duration of the police operation. Authorities are trying to negotiate with the activists to end the stand-off. In an apparent claim of responsibility posted on an environmental activists’ website, the group said it was protesting “the mass killing of sentient beings’’ and that the slaughter of animals is a significant contributor to climate change.
