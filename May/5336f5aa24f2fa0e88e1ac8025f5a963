Jakarta – A court in Indonesia’s Papua province on Thursday sentenced a Polish national to five years in prison for aiding separatist rebels, his lawyer said. His lawyer, Latifah Siregar, said that judges at the Wamena district court found Jakub Fabian Skrzypski guilty of treason. “A Papuan activist with whom he established contact, Simon Magal, was
sentenced to four years in prison in the same trial,’’ Latifah said. Latifah, who said her client would appeal, said the treason charge
stemmed from a text conversation in which Magal asked Skrzypski if he
could find weapons in Poland for the Papuan rebels. “Jakub replied to the request: ‘I’ll try to find something’,’’ Latifah said. She told dpa that the communication between Jakub and Simon was considered as evidence of treason. “Jakub was also found to have met members of the West Papuan National
Liberation Army, the armed wing of the separatist movement,’’ she
added. Latifah said that her client had insisted that he was innocent. She had earlier said that Skrzypski was an avid traveller who had
visited several conflict-ridden areas around the world to learn about
their histories. “Skrzypski entered Indonesia on a tourist visa in July and was
arrested along with three Papuans in Wamena the next month,’’ police
said. Police earlier said that the Pole had been given free access to
Papuan rebels’ activities to expose human rights violations allegedly
committed by Indonesian forces. A low-level separatist conflict has been taking place in Papua since the 1960s. Security forces have been accused of human rights abuses, while conducting counter-insurgency operations.
