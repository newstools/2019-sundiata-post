Nairobi, – The United Nations on Tuesday warned that poor waste management threatens human settlement globally.Andre Dzikus, coordinator of urban basic services branch at the UN Habitat, said this to newsmen on the sidelines of the ongoing first UN-Habitat Assembly in Nairobi.He said that inadequate waste management coupled with increasing urbanisation and population growth is becoming a major threat to humanity.“We are calling on city authorities to join ‘Waste wise cities campaign’ to help them provide basic urban services that are crucial to creating a better quality of life of populations,’’ Dzikus said.Dzikus revealed that two billion people currently do not have access to municipal solid waste collection services while another three billion people lack access to controlled waste disposal facilities.He warned that if not addressed, dumpsites will produce eight per cent to12 per cent of the global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.The UN official, however, noted that sustainable and integrated waste management can be a main driver in meeting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) goals 11.According to him, the attainment will be through the creation of green jobs, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and improvement of air, soil and water quality.“We hold trainings on financing and develop an open waste database and report on collected data for cities and local governments joining the campaign,’’ he said.The UN agency wants to raise global awareness for sustainable waste management through advocacy and education campaigns.Dzikus said that an advisory group has been set up with membership drawn from the UN agencies, governments, private sector, cities, waste management entrepreneurs and local governments.“The group will support the campaign through strategic advice, outreach to the stakeholders and offering periodic assessments,’’ he added.
