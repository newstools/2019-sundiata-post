By Nana MusaAbuja. -. The police on Monday arraigned two men, in a Grade I Area Court, Nyaya, sitting in Mpape, Abuja, for allegedly smokingÂ  Indian hemp in public. Ifeanyi Chibuzor and Jeremiah Isaac, of Jabi Motor Park, Abuja, were charged with public nuisance. The Prosecutor, Dominic Abba, told the court that a team of policemen attached to the Utako Divisional Headquarters, Abuja, arrested the defendants on May 19, while constituting nuisance within the Jabi Motor Park.

The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 133 of the Penal Code. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Judge, Abdullahi Ogedemgbe, admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N50,000 each with one surety each in like sum. Ogedembe ordered that the surety must reside within the court jurisdiction and adjourned the case until June 17, for further hearing.
