The residents made the call in interviews with   News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday. They also urged the president to give attention to infrastructure development. Mr Nick Ogbonna said he was apprehensive about insecurity in the country and urged the Federal Government do everything possible to secure the lives and property of the citizens. “I know the government is doing its best to ensure that Nigerians move freely without fear, however, I believe more could be done,’’ he said. On his part, Mr Bulus Ijiga lauded the government for its giant strides in revitalising the economy and fighting corruption and urged the president not to relent in his second term. “The Federal Government has really tried in the fight against corruption, kudos to them,” he said.
