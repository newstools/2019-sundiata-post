Relief came the way of a Nigerian, Mr Adili Chibuike Ejike, earlier sentenced to death for importing nearly two-kilogramme of methamphetamine into Singapore. In what can be described as a rear occasion, the Singapore Supreme Court acquitted Ejike and ordered his release with no outstanding charges, it was learnt. The Nigeria High Commission in Singapore in a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said “a three-member panel that delivered the judgment was led by the Chief Justice of Singapore, Sundaresh Menon”. The letter was signed by Head of Mission in Singapore, High Commissioner Akinremi Bolaji. The mission said that Ejike’s freedom from death by hanging by the court made history as the first time such a decision was made in a case involving a Nigerian. Ejike was arrested in November 2011 and has since been behind bars till May 2019 when he was discharged and acquitted. Source: tori.ng
