By Kathryn Berck The trick to getting a US visa easily: Don’t believe the slickies and touts that promise they can get you a visa for sure, for a fee, if you just take all these phony papers and memorize the spiel they teach you. Make your own application because you have a reason to go there and you know what that reason is, go to the interview, tell the simple truth, don’t exaggerate, don’t lie. I can’t guarantee that you’ll get the visa, but you will certainly sleep better knowing that the slickie-boy or tout isn’t laughing over the money you wasted on him. Source: Quora
