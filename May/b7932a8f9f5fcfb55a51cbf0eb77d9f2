The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, has given birth to a baby boy. Meghan was delivered of her baby Monday afternoon after she went into labour. Her pregnancy was announced last October during her first overseas tour with her husband in Australia. The baby will now be seventh in line to the British throne behind Prince Charles, Prince William and his three children and Prince Harry. The new baby has made history as the first biracial British child in the royal family. Source: Qed.ng
