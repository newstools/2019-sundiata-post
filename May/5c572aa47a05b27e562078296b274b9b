Is there a free well equipped children’s hospital in his own village built by him? Or a free primary/secondary school for all children of his village?”Or free care home for d aged widows in his village? I mean only in his village, at least he can afford it. I’ve never seen an adult so disgusting and shameless. Wicked enough to put a lil child like Regina in a traditional cult of ‘don’t ever cheat on me’.”His place in hell will sure be d hottest. (Well, this is just my opinion) Shan George.” Source: http://Tori.ng
