The Actors Guild of Nigeria has stated that no marriage is perfect, as it warned Tonto Dikeh over her marriage debacle which took a different twist on social media in the past few days. Prince Ifeanyi Dike, Chairman Actors Guild of Nigeria Board of Trustees who warned Tonto Dikeh on behalf of the group, stated that no marriage is perfect and her recent action is why men are scared of marrying actresses. Speaking to newstimesafrica, he said; “Tonto Dike is exhibiting bad behavior that we will no longer condone. What she should realize is that every marriage has its own issue.”No one marriage is perfect. Issues like that are private. It is very unbecoming of her to portray us in bad light. There are so many actors who have issues with their marriages without getting the public involved. “Her actions does not speak well of the industry. We are not interested in her private matters; rather we are concerned about her attitude which is rubbing off negatively on other actresses. Actions like this portray the industry as having unserious ladies. That is why men are scared of marrying actresses. Thank God that we have good examples in the industry. If she is looking for sensation, she should look for something else to use. Honestly the Board of Trustee is not happy with her and if she continues this way we will sanction her. We do not encourage bad behavior.” Source: Tori.ng
