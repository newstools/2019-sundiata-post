Amsterdam – Buses, trams, ferries and trains stopped operating in the Netherlands on Tuesday, as nationwide strike paralysed the country’s public transport system. Traffic was quick to pile up on various roads. “As a result of industrial action across the entire public transport sector, there are very limited or no train services throughout the country today,’’ state railway operator, NS, stated on its website. The strike is set to last 24 hours as unions demand better pension conditions and protesting a move to increase the retirement age to over 67. A limited train service is in operation from Amsterdam to Schipol Airport. A court had issued an injunction against an all-out strike, arguing that the key air transit hub must remain accessible. The airport told travellers not to come on Tuesday unless it is “strictly necessary.’’
