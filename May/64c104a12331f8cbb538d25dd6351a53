Few days after Tonto Dikeh announced that she’s in a relationship with a wealthy man, Vanguard newspaper has come out to confirm that the actress is not only in a serious relationship but also pregnant . Read the report: “If anyone doubts the self-acclaimed born-again Christian to be in a serious relationship, Potpourri can tell you for what’s worth that the mother of King Churchill is pregnant. A source who rolls in the close circuit of the actress has revealed.” ““It’s not a rumour, everyone close to her know she’s happy with a new man in her life. She’s about 4 months pregnant now” the source whispered with a plea of anonymity.” ” Interestingly, her romance with the cross-dresser, Idris Okuneye, known widely as Bobrisky caught the comic imagination of some artist who lit up the social media during the week with marriage photo of Tonto and her widely acclaimed best friend. It was an artistically crafted joke that even amused both Tonto and Bobrisky as they separately reacted to it with bemused expressions.” ” Coincidentally, there have been whispers of something “more than friends” between Tonto and Bobrisky. And some tongues have been wagging that the Ijebu cross dresser may just be Tonto’s man. Uncannily, Bobrisky have always moaned on social media about some celebrities begging him for money. It’s a world of make-believe and the script always has a room for adjustment.” In a swift reaction, the mother of one laughed off the rumours. Source
