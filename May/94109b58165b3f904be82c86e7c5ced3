By Elvin Jakinda What is your first thought when you see or hear about Nigerians?
Money. Mother f*cking money. In all my life in Kenya, I have met only one Nigerian in person. She had an iPhone and an accent. She must have been rich. A cousin of mine also had the fortune of knowing a Nigerian. The Nigerian never told anyone directly that he was rich. But once he hopped into his BMW and sped off to his $1000 per month apartment, my cousin knew this was not just a common peasant. Maybe there’s a broke Nigerian somewhere in this country. Unlikely though. Another thing is Nigerian culture. Kenyans LOVE Nigerian music and movies. Every matatu (public transport) in town will either be playing Hip Hop or Naija tunes. Every household TV at noon will either be playing some obscure Nollywood movie or a Spanish soap with a cliché storyline. So in short, we have a mostly positive attitude towards Nigerians… Source: Quora
