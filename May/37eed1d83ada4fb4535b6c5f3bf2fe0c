Lucas Moura scored a dramatic last minute winner to send Tottenham Hotspur into the Champions League final for the first time in its history after an astonishing comeback against Ajax in Amsterdam. Trailing 2-0 at the interval, 3-0 overall, Moura scored three times in the second half, including a last-gasp winner, to set up an all-English final against Liverpool in Madrid next month. Such a scoreline seemed unfathomable when Ajax moved two goals ahead on the night inside the opening 35 minutes courtesy of Matthijs de Ligt’s header and Hakim Ziyech’s fine strike. But Tottenham roared back after the interval with Moura scoring twice in four minutes to drag his side level on the night as Ajax began to wilt under constant waves of pressure. And with the game in the final minute of stoppage time, Moura produced another moment of magic to send Tottenham through and leave Ajax stunned. CNN.
