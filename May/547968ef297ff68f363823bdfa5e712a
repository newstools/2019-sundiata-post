By Emmanuel Mogbede Abuja – The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), has applauded President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly for composition and confirmation of Governing Board of the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and fiscal Commission (RMAFC). Mr Emmanuel Onwubiko, National Coordinator of the association in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, also urged the Elias Mbam-led board of RMAFC to work out an effective template to block leakages. According to him, this is critical to check the high rate of revenue leakages in the country which accounts for the high poverty rate. He praised the Senator Bukola Saraki – led Senate for fast-tracking the confirmation of the newly re-constituted board of the commission, which he said was long overdue. Onwubiko charged the board to, however, avail both the civil society community and the legislature the necessary information in line with the extant Freedom of Information Act of the federation. He said this would promote greater transparency and accountability by all the revenue making agencies in the country. “We commend the Executive and the Legislative arms of government for rising to the occasion by not playing partisan and divisive politics that would have delayed the confirmation process of the board. “We believe that putting in place such a robust body to lead the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission at this material point in time is the right thing to do,”” he said. He said this was imperative in view of the strategic and statutory responsibilities of such a constitutionally independent body in effectively checking all revenue leakages. (NAN)
