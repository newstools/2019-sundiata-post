Kiev, – Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman on Wednesday said Kiev will not recognise Russian passports issued to residents of certain areas in Ukraine’s eastern region of Donbas, the government press service said. “We make a decision to determine all passports issued to Ukrainian citizens in our territory as a violation of the rules of law. “These passports will be considered illegal,’’ Groysman told a cabinet meeting. Groysman also urged the international community not to accept the
Russian documents issued to Donbas residents during the border crossing
procedures. In April, Russian media reported that Russian President Vladimir
Putin signed a decree to simplify the procedure for obtaining Russian
passports by residents of certain areas in Donbas. According to the decree, the move has been taken “in order to protect human rights and freedoms.’’
