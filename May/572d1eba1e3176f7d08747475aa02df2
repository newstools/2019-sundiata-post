By Onyeje Abutu Makurdi – A Makurdi Chief Magistrates’ Court on Thursday, ordered the  remand of two men in prison for allegedly robbing a woman of her valuables. The defendants, Tersoo Joseph and Demenenge Iorwakwagh of no fixed
addresses, are standing trial on a three-count charge of criminal
conspiracy, armed robbery and rape. The magistrate, Mr Isaac Ajim, adjourned the matter until June 4 for further mention. Earlier, the prosecutor, Sgt. Friday Kanshio, told the court that the
complainant (name withheld) of Behind Bem Hotel, Makurdi, reported the
matter at the ‘A’ Division Police Station, Makurdi on Feb. 8. Kanshio said that on the same date, the complainant boarded the
defendants’ motorcycle to INEC office, Makurdi but was diverted to an
uncompleted building at Quararafa Quarters. He added that at the uncompleted building, the complainant was
allegedly attacked with a knife and  dispossessed of her Tecno K7 cell
phone valued N32, 500 and  N2,500. The prosecutor also said that the duo took turns and forcefully raped the complainant. Kanshio said that the defendants were arrested during police investigation and they confessed to have committed the crime. According to him, the offence is punishable under Sections 6(b),
1(1)(2)(a)(b) of the Robbery and Firearms Act, 2004 and 284 of the Penal
Code Laws of Benue, 2004. However, when the case came up for mention, the plea of the defendants was not taken by the court for lack of jurisdiction. The prosecutor informed the court that investigation into the matter was still in progress and asked for another date. The magistrate, therefore, adjourned the matter until June 4 for further mention.
