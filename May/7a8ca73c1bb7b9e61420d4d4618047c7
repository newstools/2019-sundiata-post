Double Olympic champion Caster Semenya has lost her appeal against the introduction of new rules regulating the testosterone levels for athletes with a difference in sex development (DSD). The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) announced that its panel had rejected the South African’s challenge against the IAAF’ “by majority.” Athletics’ governing body’s new regulations will now require any athlete with a naturally high level of testosterone who wishes to compete in international track and field events from 400 meters to the mile to reduce their testosterone levels, should they want to continue competing as women. “Sometimes it’s better to react with no reaction,” tweeted Semenya after the verdict was announced.
