CAPE TOWN – South Africa’s deputy president, David Mabuza, will not be sworn in as a lawmaker on Wednesday after requesting a postponement to address allegations he brought the ruling African National Congress (ANC) into disrepute, president Cyril Ramaphosa said. Ramaphosa,
who is also the leader of the ANC, is due to be elected on Wednesday by
the 400 lawmakers in parliament’s National Assembly and lower house,
where his party holds the majority. He will be inaugurated on Saturday. The
ANC easily won South Africa’s May 8 general election but its share of
the vote fell, reflecting anger at corruption scandals and racial
inequalities that remain entrenched a generation after the party took
power. Mabuza, the former premier of Mpumalanga, a coal-producing
northeastern province, has struggled to shrug off longstanding
allegations of corruption there. A report by the ANC’s Integrity
Commission suggested he had brought the party into disrepute. “The
deputy president has indicated he would like to have an opportunity to
address… these allegations,” said Ramaphosa in an ANC statement. “The
deputy president believes that the ANC as a governing party should
advance the electoral mandate in an environment of public trust.” Mabuza played a key role in ensuring Ramaphosa was elected in a tight contest to take over from scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma at the ANC’s election conference in December 2017. (Reuters)
