By Didier Champion As of November 2018, I would be very careful of the following. Libya, Somalia, South Sudan, RCA ( Republic Central Africa), some selected parts of Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. My criteria are very simple. Any place where there is a war or some sort of extremism going on ( Libya, Somalia, South Sudan, and parts of Nigeria).
Any place where foreign troops are on the ground ( French and UN troops, especially). Mali, Niger, and RCA. Former French colonies tend to be a mess.
There can be some exceptions here and there, but these are very simple rules. Of all places, I have been to Eastern DRC ( Democratic Republic of Congo). I don’t recommend going there if you are not familiar with the place though. By the time you finish other 45–48 countries, the above countries should also be okay to travel to. They will hopefully get better over time. Other African countries are a GO for me. I am talking about your personal safety due to instability here. There are so many factors of course. Before traveling to Africa, you should educate yourself wherever you are going. It really makes your trip manageable when you are prepared. Do not freestyle your trip to Africa if you are a first-timer, especially. Source: Quora
