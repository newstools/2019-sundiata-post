By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ Former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan have shunned the inauguration of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Sundiata Post recalls that President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo took oath of office for their second term in office on Wednesday at the Eagle Square, Abuja. No reason has been given for their absence and no statement has been issued by their media aides as to why they are absent. Acting chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), Ibrahim Muhammad, administered the oath of office on Buhari and Osinbajo. Recall that the presidential candidate of the opposition People Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar who was Vice President to former president Obasanjo, is currently at the election petition tribunal, contesting the declaration of President Buhari as the winner of the 2019 Presidential election. The Turaki Adamawa is claiming that he defeated incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari in the just concluded election and has approached the tribunal to retrieve alleged stolen mandate.
