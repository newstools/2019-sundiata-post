By Ibrahim Kado Gombe – The National Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO) has appealed to traditional rulers to find  means of preserving the cultures and traditions of their respective domains. The coordinator of NICO in Gombe State, Malam Yahaya Sanda, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Gombe on Tuesday. According to him, the traditional leaders are in better positions to promote their cultures to avoid the risk of them going into extinction. “Traditional rulers have vital roles to play in promoting their cultures and preserving them for the coming generations.’’ Yahaya urged traditional rulers to give all the necessary support and cooperation to NICO toward achieving its mandate. “Since they are the custodians of cultures, the desired results will be achieved when they encourage their communities to prioritise the use of their distinctive mother tongues, especially, at among their wards and homes. “This is the only way the indigenous languages that are seemingly going into extinction will be protected and preserved,” he said.
