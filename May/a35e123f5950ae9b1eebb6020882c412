By Habibu Harisu Sokoto – The Governorship, State and National Houses of Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal in Sokoto State on Wednesday, dismissed a motion filed by PDP, seeking to strike out a suit filed by the APC, for late filing of  pre-hearing processes. The APC candidate in the 2019 election for Isa/Sabon-Birni Federal
Constituency, Alhaji Sani Aminu-Isa, approached the Tribunal challenging
the return of member-elec, Alhaji Sa’idu Bargaja of the PDP , over
alleged election malpractices. Bargaja through his Counsel, Mr Ibrahim Abdullahi,in a motion, prayed
the tribunal to dismiss the entire petition on grounds that the
petitioner and his party contravened major conditions of seven days
filing of pre-hearing notices. The petitioner, Aminu-Isa and his party through their Counsel, Mr
Steve Nwoke, opposed the application and argued that the notice was
filed within the stipulated time, while payment was made in compliance
with the tribunal’s directive. In his ruling on Wednesday, Tribunal Chairman, Justice Peter
Akhihiero, said he considered all the arguments and citations by the
Counsels on the late issuance of pre-hearing notices in the suit. Akhihiero said it is evident that  the tribunal Secretary confirmed
that the petitioners made the application for issuance of pre-hearing
notices within the stipulated time. Justice Akhihiero, thereby, dismissed the motion against the respondents and awarded N20, 000 as cost. He adjourned the case until May 10 for continuation of pre-hearing session.
