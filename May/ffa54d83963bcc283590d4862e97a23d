Funmilayo Okunade Ado-Ekiti – An Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday remanded an 18-year-old sales boy, Emeka Emmanuel, in prison for allegedly defiling a seven-year-old girl. The Magistrate, Mr Adesoji Adegboye, ordered that the defendant be
remanded in prison and the case file sent to the Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. He adjourned the case until June 5 for mention as the plea of the accused was not taken. The defendant whose address was not provided is facing a charge of rape. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Insp. Johnson Okunade, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on May 11 in Ado-Ekiti. Okunade alleged that the defendant lured the girl with money and took her behind a shop building and defiled her. He said that the accused defiled the girl four times whenever his
boss was not around, adding that the girl became sick some days later,
as a result. “She then confessed that the defendant has been having sexual intercourse with her,’’ the prosecutor said. Okunade said the offence contravened Section 31 of the Child Right Law of Ekiti State, 2012. The prosecutor urged the court to remand the accused in prison
pending legal advice from the office of director of public prosecutions.
