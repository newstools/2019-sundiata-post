Taipei – The U.S. move to raise tariffs on Chinese imports will have a limited effect on Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Friday. The U.S. increased tariffs on 200 billion dollars of Chinese imports from 10 per cent to 25 per cent. In Taipei, Tsai said the U.S.-China trade war would drastically
change the global economic order and existing supply chains but said,
however, that the latest U.S. measure would have a limited impact on
Taiwan. Amid the U.S.-China trade war, a number of companies investing in
China, including Taiwanese businesses, have considered pulling out their
supply chain activities. Tsai said that Taiwan, with stable economic growth, since 2018 had
optimised its environment to attract more overseas investment as a way
to respond to the trade dispute. “`We aim to speed up the process for overseas Taiwanese businesses to
return to Taiwan and rebuild the value-added industry chain here,’’
Tsai told a news conference. On Thursday, Tsai doubled a government goal to attract overseas
investment this year to 500 billion Taiwan dollars (15.5 billion dollar)
after investments worth of almost 280 billion Taiwan dollars were
pledged. “By the end of this year more measures will be carried out to lure
more overseas investment, such as streamlining procedures, simplifying
tax regulations and others,’’ Tsai said. Meanwhile, Tsai said, Taiwan would still be willing to engage in a bilateral trade agreement with the U.S.
