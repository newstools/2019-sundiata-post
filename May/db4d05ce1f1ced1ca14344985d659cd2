By Kelechi Wachuku There are some features about Yoruba that stand out to me as interesting. Yoruba has a phenomenon called vowel copying. This is most often realized with the third person singular object pronoun, which is simply a copy of the vowel of the preceding verb. For example: [1] [2] This vowel copying also occurs as a clitic when showing emphasis, but is never the same tone as the previous vowel. [3]  Above: Yoruba Personal Pronouns Consonant Deletion and Vowel Assimilation also often take place in fluent speech, which also takes tone into account, when certain consonants appear between two identical vowels or ones with similar points of articulation. [4][5][6]  Above: Yoruba Greetings for Different Times of the Day Yoruba, like many languages in West Africa, has labial-velar consonants, which, outside of this part of the world, is quite exceptional.  Above: The Yoruba Language Alphabet & Tone Marks Yoruba is a highly isolating language, much like Chinese. This stands somewhat in contrast to the languages in its broader linguistic family, which are often rather agglutinative. It also makes extensive use of serial verb constructions,too. In this case, verbs come right after each other without any other linking phoneme, like “to” or “and.” Also, there could be two or more verbs in the phrase that could just be translated as one verb in another language, like English. Lots of African languages have this feature, but is used to an extent that, for example, English or French speaker, are not used to. Yoruba also has a fair deal of Arabic-derived words, such these below: [12] “Àdúrà” → Prayer “Àlàfíà” → Peace, to hail “Ẹṣin”→ Horse Source: Quora.
