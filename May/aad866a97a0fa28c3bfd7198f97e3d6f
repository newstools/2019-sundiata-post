Buhari and his co-jesters should have known that 95% of arms outside governmental control were ILLEGALLY ACQUIRED. You do not need a Ph.D in Security Studies to know this. So which licenses is he revoking? Since 2002, various African governments have been trying to curb the proliferation of small firearms on the continent. Former President Obasanjo was at the forefront of this. Now, the Arab Spring that started in 2011 which spread the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) actually pushed illegal arms and ammunition down Africa south of the Sahara. How? Those who were used to oust Mouamer Gadaffi formed foot soldiers for the splinter armed groups which held Libya after and later, most of these foot soldiers sold their weapons. Boko Haram and Fulani herdsmen were one of their major buyers. The Tuareg fighters who have held northern part of Mali for years have also been a major security challenge for the West Africa region. The major challenge for any serious President whose mental capacity is operating at optimal level is this: HOW DO I CURB THE SPREAD OF SMALL AND MEDIUM FIREARMS IN MY COUNTRY? My GREATEST fear is that, under Buhari, the Nigeria state is gradually losing the CONTROL OF FORCES OF COERCION. POWER CENTRES OF VIOLENCE ARE SPRINGING UP EVERYDAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. And when this happens, citizens usually resort to self-help. And any sensible person should know the implication of that. And what is it? We may win the war against insecurity, but may not survive the ‘peace’ after. Source: Facebook
