According to officials of the Nigerian Red Cross Society, over 150,000 people in Plateau State benefit annually from diverse humanitarian services from the organization. The services range from Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), Relief interventions, First aid trainings and services, Community Based Health care programs, Youth programs, to International Humanitarian Law, IHL and other dissemination activities, Chairman of the Plateau State Branch of the Society, Chief John Mankilik said. Leading hundreds of officials, members and volunteers of the body in a procession to mark the World Red Cross Day celebration on Wednesday, Chief Mankilik assured citizens that the body is able to respond to their needs anytime and anywhere they are. “Our volunteers are as diverse as the life-saving and life-changing services they provide through the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: 190 National Societies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC),” he said. The Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement according to him has been serving the people of Plateau state since 1967. The World Red Cross Day is marked every 8th of May across 190 National Societies around the world. In 2019, these National Societies are also celebrating 100 years of the International Federation of the Red Cross, which was founded by the Red Cross societies of France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan and the United States of America. IFRC – originally known as the League of Red Cross Societies, was created to preserve, share and promote the expertise and knowledge gained during humanitarian responses to the First World War and the Spanish Flu epidemic, official records say.
