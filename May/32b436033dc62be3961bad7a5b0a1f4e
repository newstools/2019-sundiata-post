Zimbabwean President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has sacked the minister of energy and power development, Joram Gumbo, over poor electricity supply across the country. Reuters reported on Monday that the last time Zimbabwe experienced blackout of up to eight hours was in 2016 after a devastating drought. The firing of Gumbo comes after he had licenced over 30 companies to provide solar power to the country. Gumbo had even concluded plans to travel to Mozambique for an electricity partnership deal. The state-owned power firm, Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC), had said there would be blackouts for about eight hours daily because of a drop in output at its largest hydro plant and ageing coal-fired generators. “The power shortfall is being managed through load shedding in order to balance the power supply available and the demand,” it said. Zimbabwe is currently producing 969 megawatts (MW) daily against peak demand of 2,100 MW due to low water levels and poor coal supplies to the generating plants. Mr Mnangagwa has appointed the deputy minister for transport and infrastructural development, Fortune Chasi, to replace Gumbo. Source: qed.ng
