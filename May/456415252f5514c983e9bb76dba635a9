By Amen Gajira Minna – A Minna Magistrates’ Court has sentenced a student, Udozoh Kenneth, to 10 strokes of the cane, for violating Niger Government’s order banning motorcycles’ operations beyond 9.00 p.m. in the state. Kenneth was charged with disobedience to order promulgated by the
state government, contrary to Section 34 of the Road Traffic Regulations
2015. The Prosecutor, Insp. Aliyu Yakubu, had told the court that the
defendant was arrested on April 15 at 9.30 p.m. riding his motorcycle
within Minna metropolis. Yakubu said the defendant’s action was in clear violation of the
state government’s order, banning the use of motorcycles between 9.00
p.m. and 6.00 a.m. When the charge was read to him, he pleaded guilty and begged for leniency, adding that he was ignorant of the law. The prosecutor thereafter prayed the court to try him summarily in line with section 157 of the Criminal Procedure Code. In her ruling, Magistrate Deborah Solomon held that ignorance of the law was not an excuse for committing an offence. Solomon, however, said she would be lenient on him considering that he was a student. The magistrate sentenced him to receive 10 strokes of the cane.
