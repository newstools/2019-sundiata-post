By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has hailed the judgment of the Court of Appeal which ruled that its victorious Osun State governorship candidate, Senate Ademola Adeleke, was constitutionally qualified to contest the governorship election. The PDP described the judgment as a triumph of justice and the will of the people of Osun state over oppressive forces. The party which disclosed this on Thursday in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the judgement serves as a lesson to desperate politicians engaging in abuse of court processes. The statement reads in part: The PDP notes that the ruling of the Court of Appeal has finally put to rest all contentions about the educational qualification of Senator Adeleke and renders all such cases in lower courts incompetent. The party says that in ruling that the FCT High Court was wrong in nullifying Senator Adeleke’s candidacy “when the evidence before the court proved that Adeleke had met all the constitutional requirements”, for the election, the Appeal Court has affirmed justice and restored the verdict of the Osun people on the eligibility of our candidate to stand for election. Moreover, the findings of the Appeal Court that the FCT High Court lacked powers to entertain the matter, since the issues therein are related to what transpired in Osun State, serves as a lesson to desperate politicians engaging in abuse of court processes. The PDP commends these Justices of the Court of Appeal for restoring the confidence reposed on the judiciary as the last hope of the common man and counseled the APC and its agents to end their unnecessary attacks on Senator Adeleke and allow the people of Osun state to enjoy their much-desired benefits of having a competent, people-oriented and purposeful leadership under Senator Adeleke.
