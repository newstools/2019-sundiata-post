Somadina has been rumoured to be a former lover to the reigning actress, Regina Daniels and the unconfirmed reports have refused to go away. Despite being alleged to be married to one politician and businessman from Delta State, Regina Daniels has still gone ahead to shower praises on Soma who has a long history with her. They both met in the local film industry, Nollywood and gossips have alleged that they dated for a while before Ned Nwoko opened the floodgates of wealth to distract the 21 -year old actress who is presently a student of the Igbinedion University, Okada, Edo State. “There is no other male friend that can take your part in my life. This is true because you have been the best of them since this day. Happy birthday baby,” she captioned the pictures she took with Soma. Soma, a tertiary institution graduate claims to be 20.
