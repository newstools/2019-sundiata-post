Rome – The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) on Friday said that it had launched an antitrust investigation against Google, accusing it of giving unfair advantage to its Google Maps app. The AGCM takes issue with Google refusing to incorporate into its
Android operating system an app giving information on recharge stations
for electric cars. The app, called “Enel X Recharge,” was developed by Enel, Italy’s main electricity company. AGCM suspects Enel’s app was sidelined to favour Google Maps, which offers similar information. “Google’s interest seems to be that of defending and strengthening
the business model of its Google Maps app,” the Italian authority said
in a statement. AGCM said it would conclude its investigation by May 30, 2020.
