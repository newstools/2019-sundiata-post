Chairman of the National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives (NNM) in Benue State, Comrade Esther Akpai has revealed that four nurses have been abducted in the state, New Telegrah reports. Comrade Akpai who disclosed this in Makurdi said the abductors also killed one health worker. She raised the alarm of threat to lives of nurses in the state, saying the nurses were abducted at different locations in the state. Comrade Akpai said nurses in the state were facing security challenges in the discharge of their duties and regretted that neither state government nor security chiefs in the state had come to their rescue. She lamented that criminals were still on the trail of their members. Akpai also stated that the State General Hospital in Katsina-Ala had been shut down following the union’s advice on the security situation in the area. “As at last year, two nurses working at Federal Medical Center, Makurdi were abducted, also in Katsina-Ala and one health worker was killed during the crisis in Katsina-Ala”. “As a result of the crisis, we advised the board, (Health Management Board) to close down the State General Hospital in Katsina-Ala and it has been shut down”. “Yet they (criminals) are still running after nurses in Katsina-Ala”. Alluding to steps taken by the state government and security operatives to tackle the security challenges faced by her members, Akpai said, ‘at any point we have such issues, we draw the attention of government and security chiefs in the state to them but there is no response’. “You know, nurses work on three shifts, but the second shift close at 9pm and third shift resume that time, so at that time, they are going home they (nurses) are exposed to attack,” she stated.
