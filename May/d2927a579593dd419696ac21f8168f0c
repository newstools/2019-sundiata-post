Liverpool – Sadio Mane says he is happy at Liverpool and will not let speculation that he is wanted by Real Madrid distract him ahead of Saturday’s Champions League final against Tottenham Hotspur. Real Madrid are looking to strengthen their squad after reappointing Zinedine Zidane as manager. Mane, according to reports in Spain, is one of a number of players being linked with a move to Madrid. The Senegal international was joint top scorer in the English Premier League (EPL) this season. Mane won the top scorer alongside team mate Mohamed Salah and Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, and signed a new five-year contract with Liverpool in November. “For me the most important thing is Liverpool and I’m happy here,” Mane told reporters. “I’m preparing for one of the biggest games for the club, the fans and the players as well. So, let’s focus on this one first and win it. “(Speculation) is part of football, so we have to deal with it. It’s always a pleasure that this kind of team wants (you), but don’t forget Liverpool. They beat big teams.” Mane said Liverpool were especially motivated to beat Spurs after losing to Real Madrid in last season’s Champions League final and finishing second in the league behind Manchester City this season. “(Last year’s final) will help with this one, because we wanted to win it and it was not the case. “It’s positive because many people didn’t expect us to play this final,” he added. “We didn’t win the league, but we still have one trophy to play for. So, we are going to try to give everything to win it.”
