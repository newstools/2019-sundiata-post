By Oluwafunke Ishola Lagos – The Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce (NACC) is set to position the nation’s Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) for improved profitability and sustainable global competitiveness. The Communications Executive of NACC, Mr Ebuka Ugochukwu, told  the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Lagos that the chamber would achieve the objective through its forthcoming conference and exhibition. Ugochukwu said that many SMEs in the country have innovative products that could be leveraged upon and serve as catalysts to sustainable growth and economic development. He said that NACC would hold the third African Food and Products Conference and Exhibition (AFPE) between May 24 and May 25 in Lagos. He said that its theme will be: ‘Sustainability and Innovation; Pathway to Business Success for SMEs’. Ugochukwu said that the exhibition was to enhance trade, commerce, investment and industrial technological relationship between the public and private sectors from Nigeria, Africa and the United States of America (USA). According to Ugochukwu, the United States’ Consul General, chief executive officers (CEOs) of multinational firms and government agencies will attend the event. He said that the stakeholders would also discuss strategies for scaling up productivity, profitability and competitiveness in the SME sector. “We are expecting over 2,500 participating companies from Nigeria, Africa and the United States. “The exhibition will be presenting a viable opportunity for them to boost sales and strike business deals that will run into several millions of dollars,” he said.
