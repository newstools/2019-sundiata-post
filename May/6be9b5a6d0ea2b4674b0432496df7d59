by Yemi Adeleye Lagos – A Lagos lawmaker, Mr Olayiwola Olawale, on Thursday advised President Muhammadu Buhari to consider changing the nation’s security chiefs to bring in fresh ideas in securing lives and property. Olawale, the Chairman, Lagos State House of Assembly Committee on Home Affairs made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). According to him, the spate of killings and kidnappings in the country must be addressed and curtailed to ensure sanctity of human lives. “What I am saying about those security chiefs is that they need to be changed. They have really overstayed their time. “They need to be changed. There should be new set of people to take over the mantle of security leadership. “All I see in them is that they are tired. If they are not tired, we cannot be voting billions of naira with equipment and the killings still continue,” Olawale (APC-Mushin II) said. He urged the Federal Government to bring to book all culprits and criminals involved in the killing of innocent citizens across the country. On Ramadan, the lawmaker called for peace and unity among Nigerians, urging them to forgive one another to move the nation forward. He urged his constituents and Nigerians in general to abstain from evil that could impede God’s intervention in challenges facing the country, especially insecurity. Olawale urged Nigerians, especially Muslims, to move closer to God and pray for peace and unity of Nigeria during the fast. “Fasting makes both the rich and the poor equal before the Almighty Allah. There is no difference between the poor and the rich,” he said. “Ramadan teaches us the humility that must be displayed by all. We should see ourselves as one,” he said. (NAN)
