By Sainath Kesavan Many people have mentioned $$. Based on my 10 years of experience in the US, the saving money happens only if you are a bachelor, sharing an apartment with 2/3 others. The other scenario is if both husband and wife are working. IF you are a single earner with the other spouse on H4 and 1–2 kids, saving is very limited unless you live a super frugal life. There are also instances of single earner bringing home 150K+ and on H1-B. In such cases, saving is possible. Reason for staying here that are very personal to me are: Quality of life is better – Quality of food, air you breathe (I know, this is debatable), medical services Value for life is better. An example is when I had to call 911 last year for a medical condition. The fire and ambulance were at my house in a few mins. In India the traffic (I am from Pune and Mumbai) conditions prevent quick responses from happening. Yes, a lot of drivers will give way in both countries but based on overall traffic and infrastructure, it will still take time in cities like Delhi/Pune etc) Infrastructure; I am in CT so roads are still bad but not as bad as in Pune or Bangalore Amount of corruption – This exists in both countries. My experience is that in the US, the corruption is more at the very high echelon but basic services like Driving license, SSN, etc get issued smoothly, on time. I am sure there are exceptional cases but again, this is my experience. Non Indian management mentality – This is better in the US vs. India. I can only compare between US and India and this is not a reason to be in the US; it is my point of view. I have seen my Indian managers find fault and pick at the faults of others and mine too vs. appreciating the work you do and being cool about faults. Of course there are Indian managers who are not like what I described. Again, this is from my experience of 18 years as a Software Engineer. Source: Quora
