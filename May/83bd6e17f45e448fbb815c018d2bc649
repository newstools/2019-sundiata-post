By Ikuru Lizzy Port Harcourt – Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), has condemned killings by unknown gunmen on Friday, May 17 in Bo-ue, an Ogoni community in Bori, Khana Local Government Area of Rivers. The Acting Publicity Secretary of MOSOP, Mr Sunny Zorvah, made the movement’s position known on Tuesday in Port harcourt. He said the situation had become very worrisome as it happened a few days after a successful strategic stakeholders meeting organised by the Khana Local Government Council authority. “The incident is so disheartening that it has become necessary for more drastic measures and stakeholders commitments to check escalating insecurity in Ogoniland. “This killing is one too many and it’s quite sad and unfortunate that it’s gradually rubbing the peace in our communities without any arrest and prosecution of perpetrators. “Both the criminals and sponsors of the unjustifiable massacre of innocent citizens should be brought to justice,” Zovah said in a statement. Zorvah said that unidentified gun men had on Friday invaded parts of Bori Town, shot sporadically and killed one person, while on Sunday about 20 persons were shot dead in Kono Bo-ue community also by unidentified gunmen.. “How can one explain the reason for the killing of about 20 innocent natives in a community that is not at war with her neighbours and does not have report of intra-communal conflict as at the time of the incident? “We appeal to the federal and Rivers governments to carry out the fight against gang wars and criminality with demonstrable vigour,” he said. The statement also called on the people of the area to remain law-abiding, urging community and traditional leaders in the area to cooperate with the security agencies to strategise towards exposing the perpetrators and bringing lasting peace to Ogoniland. MOSOP also sympathised with the people of Kono- Bo-ue community, particularly, families of the victims,” Zorvah said. (NAN)
