By Sumaila OgbajeAbuja, May 29, 2019 (NAN) The FCT police have restricted movement of vehicles on routes leading directly to the Eagle Square in Abuja city centre. The police said the restriction is part of security measures put in place to ensure a hitch-free inauguration of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for a second term in office. Some of the routes affected include the Umaru Musa Yarâ€™Adua Express way known as airport road. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that all the vehicles from the axis were made to turn back from the city gate to other routes such as Jabi and Games Village. The situation made the games village-Area 1 route to experience heavy gridlock into Garki. Security operatives were seen at strategic locations keeping vigilance on vehicles. NAN also observed, however, that movement out of the city was not restricted on the same route. There was, however, free movement of vehicles especially in Garki District, comprising Areas one to area 11. The authorities have earlier announced the diversion of traffic along some major routes linking Eagle Square, the venue of the inauguration.
