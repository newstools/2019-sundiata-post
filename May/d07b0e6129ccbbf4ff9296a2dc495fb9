Ace actress, Remilekun Oshodi, popularly called Remi Surutu, by her friends and fans, recently celebrated her birthday. However, in an interview with Saturday Beats, she reflected on how thankful she was to God on how far He had brought her despite the agony she went through after she lost her daughter in 2017. She noted that she never questioned God after the death of her child, adding that God knows best. In the ’80s, many people were not aware of the implications of sickle cell because they had never experienced it. I speak to people who are willing to listen, that it is not an easy experience. They need to check themselves to avoid bringing a beautiful child to the world and end up crying over them. Iyabo Ojo released a video on Mother’s Day that made me cry so much because I knew what I went through to have my first child and at the end of the day, she is not here to celebrate with me. I thank God that her sister is alive and she is not a sickle cell patient and God has been faithful to her,” she told Saturday Beats. Source
