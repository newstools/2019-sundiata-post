Beijing â€“ China has at least 30 million asthma patients and only around 5 per cent have received proper treatments, experts warned ahead of the World Asthma Day that falls on Tuesday. Severe asthma attacks are mainly attributed to failing to receive standard treatments or overall healthcare. Most asthma attacks can be curbed if patients resort to such approaches, said Liu Guoliang, chief physician of the Centre for Respiratory Diseases of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital. Once a patient is diagnosed with asthma, the patient should start treatment as soon as possible to reach the best curative effects, Liu said, adding that overall healthcare aims to strengthen the monitoring of the disease. Experts also asked asthma patients to wear masks and maintain regular medication during seasons of flying catkins.
