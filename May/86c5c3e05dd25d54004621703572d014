 Igbaugba Ehigimetor Benin. -. Edo Commissioner of Police, Mr Mohammed DanMallam, on Sunday confirmed the killing of a lecturer with the Igbinedion University, Okada, near Benin, by suspected kidnappers. DanMallam said the lecturer, Kelvin Izevbekhai, was killed in an attempted escape bid when the victims were being marched into the forest by the kidnappers. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) gathered that the gunmen were said to be operating near Okada junction along the Benin-Lagos highway. It was learnt that the gunmen abducted Izevbekhai and other passengers in the bus they were travelling in. “The driver of the minibus was said to have fled into the bush along with four other passengers. “Unfortunately, one of the passengers who tried to escape during the abduction was killed by the gunmen. “The police went after the kidnappers in the bush and succeeded in rescuing the victims.” He said the police were working on a new strategy which entails taking the war to the kidnappers’ den in the jungle, adding that it is the best way to tackle the scourge. Spokesman for the university, Mr Jide Ilugbo, who confirmed the killing described it as “barbaric.” İlugbo said late Izevbekhai was a First Class graduate and was employed in the university in 2016. He said it was now dangerous to travel on the Benin-Lagos highway due to frequent attacks by armed robbers and kidnappers. The official said it was unfortunate he ran into hoodlums, saying that the trailer parked before Okada junction is a hideout for criminals.
