According to a report by TheCable, some members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN ), better known as Shiites, set ablaze the national flags of the US and Israel during a massive protest in Abuja on Friday. The protesters, who converged on Wuse market junction, described the US and Israel as enemies and oppressors of the people of Palestine. Abdullahi Musa, secretary of the academic forum of the movement, said the flags were burnt to show anger against the countries over their “oppressive tendency” against Palestine. The flags were displayed to the crowd with the caricature of President Donald Trump before some members of the group sprayed fuel on them. The incident led to traffic logjam in the area. Also, three coffins wrapped with Palestinian flags were on display which signified the three children of Ibraheem El-Zakyzaky, leader of the group, who were killed by the security operatives during a protest in Zaria in 2015. The movement said the protest was organised to drive home the demand for President Muhammadu Buhari to release Ibraheem El-Zakyzaky, leader of the group, to enable him seek medical attention. The group vowed to continue with the protest irrespective of the “intimidation” by the security agents. The security operatives had on Friday morning mounted several roadblocks along Maraba-Abuja express way subjecting people to security checks. Source
