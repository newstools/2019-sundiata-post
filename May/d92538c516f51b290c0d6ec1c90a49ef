By Joshua OladipoOsogbo. – The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Osun has called for more awareness campaign in the state to ensure that child-related accidents are reduced on the highways. The Sector Commander, Mr Peter Oke, made the call on the sidelines of an awareness campaign programme on road safety matters for young people organised to mark the Children’s Day celebration in Osogbo. According to Oke, about 1.3 million persons across the globe died annually in road accidents and the United Nations had come to identify with children being the most vulnerable in such circumstances. “The Corps had formulated many policies to reduce the menace, ’’ he said. According to him, some of the policies introduced by the command is the `Catch Them Young’ policy in schools and Road Safety Clubs, among others. Oke said that the foundation level of any children was very paramount in inculcating safety consciousness just as the Holy Bible had stipulated. “The reason why they are getting it right on safety matters in the International world was because they attach importance to the foundation of children coupled with other policies,’’ he said. Oke noted that the safety culture must also be inculcated in the children so that when they grow up, it would be difficult for them to neglect. The FRSC boss, however, noted that safety consciousness is a shared responsibility which must not be left alone in the hands of the corps or marshals but must involve all and sundry. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that at the event were children from various schools in the state including members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and other dignitaries.
