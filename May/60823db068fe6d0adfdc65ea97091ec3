Abuja (Sundiata Post) – United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Thursday in New York announced the appointment of His Royal Highness Muhammadu Sanusi II, Emir of Kano, as one of his new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Advocates for 2019-2020. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) sai a statement by UN quoted Guterres as saying that the appointment was sequel to the UN member states’ agreement to accomplish the SDGs by 2030. The Advocates are 17 influential public figures from around the world who are tasked by the secretary-general to promote the goals, raise awareness with new audiences, maintain global commitment and call for greater ambition and scalable action to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Sanusi is the only Nigerian on the 17-man secretary-general’s list of SDGs Advocates co-chaired by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of Ghana and Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway. Sundiata Post recalls that his appointment as new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Advocate came a day after the signing into law of bill splitting Kano Emirate into five emirates. It is alleged that the passing of the bill by the Kano state House of Assembly and the quick assent to it by Governor Ganduje was to whittle down the power of the Emir of Kano. Governor Ganduje is alleged to have moved against the Emir of Kano for openly criticizing the abysmal performance of the four-year tenure of Governor Ganduje’s government.
