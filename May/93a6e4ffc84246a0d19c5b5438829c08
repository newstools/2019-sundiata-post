By Ohis Steve Quite an interesting question. The answer depends on the angle. Economically, Nigeria is far past the league of East & Central Africa where Rwanda falls. The size, population AND resources that Nigeria possesses cannot be aimed for by Rwanda. Thus, they are not comparable in this area. Politically, we don’t need to go into the future. Presently, Rwanda’s political atmosphere is far past the league of Nigeria and West Africa. Identity politics, endemic corruption of indescribable proportions, fatal rivalries, etc. are things Rwandans may never come to know no matter what wrong they think goes on in their country. They had their share of catastrophes and have since moved forward. Nigeria hasn’t and is going NOWHERE as long as it continues in its current path. The sociocultural status of Rwanda is also far ahead of Nigeria’s thanks to the unification efforts of Paul Kagame. Nigeria, with over 500 tribes most of which barely respect the others, has an awful lot to do in this regard. Overall, judging according to size and potential, Rwanda has a better future than Nigeria. However, Nigeria can dramatically change its course and bring about a radical transformation in its reality. That’s only if there’s some sort of ‘Naija Spring’ which is unlikely. Thus one can only hope for a ‘not too terrible’ leader to lead the nation.
