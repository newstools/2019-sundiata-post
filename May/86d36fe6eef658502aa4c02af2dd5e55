(Sundiata Post) – Onitsha, the commercial hub and busy city of Anambra is as
quiet as a grave yard and shadow of itself on Thursday morning in compliance
with the Sit-at-home order issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Recall
that the IPOB had declared May 30, 2019 as sit-at-home day in the south east in
honour of those who died in the struggle for the actualization of Biafra. The
streets and markets are deserted as the famed commercial town shuts down
following the Sit-at-Home order issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra
(IPOB) to honour the Biafra dead. Security agencies had vowed
to abort the event scheduled to hold across the five South-East states and
other Igbo-speaking parts of Nigeria. This
sit-at-home order is expected to affect activities in the states of Imo, Abia,
Enugu and Ebonyi. Sundiata
Post gathered that the situation is different in Umuahia as people are going
about their normal businesses with shops open and children were seen going to
school. Details
