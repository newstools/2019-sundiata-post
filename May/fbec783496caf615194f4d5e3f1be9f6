Itâ€™s no more news that a great percent of pictures seen on social media are unreal; they are mostly doctored to attract public appeal. Curvy and brief actress, Moyo Lawal is back again in the news for a controversial act. She posted some pictures on social media and in a bid to look sexy, she decided to edit one of the full pictures to make her hips and bum bigger. Unfortunately for her, her amateur multi-media skills affected the surrounding of the picture with the gate at the background bent. This attracted the attention of her fans who have been mocking her since the picture emerged. The single actress has refused to be bullied as she quickly joined in the fun.
