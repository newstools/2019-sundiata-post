No happiness is without sorrw! The only way up is down! To go up you must come down! Cant have a breaktru without a breakdown! Cant have a destination without a journey! Nobody wins a game of chess by just going forward. Sometimes you just gotta stop, breath, take a step back or many steps BACK if you must. cry if you have to because nothing can clean your eyes better than your own tears. Remember why because those who never loose sight of their reason never loose focus. Makanakian PRAY because Only God is king Adufe wassup baby @queennino_b”
