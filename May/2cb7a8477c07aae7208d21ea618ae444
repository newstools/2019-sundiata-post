Celebrity police officer, Dolapo Badmos, has taunted Nigerian rapper, Naira Marley, over his arrest by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC). News of Naira Marley’s arrest broke Friday morning. Although, the reason for his arrest has not been made public, it is believed to be in connection with his statements on social media glorifying internet fraud. In a veiled tweet on Friday, Dolapo wrote that the only naira she knew about was the Nigerian currency and that any other was counterfeit. “The only authentic NAIRA I know is Nigeria’s legal tender. Any other naira attached to something is a counterfeit!” she said. Naira Marley had on Thursday released the official video of latest single, Am I A Yahoo Boy, featuring Zlatan Ibile. In April, the controversial rapper said in an Instagram post that if anyone knew about the transatlantic slave trade they would not refer to ‘Yahoo Yahoo’ as a crime. He also urged Nigerians to pray for cybercriminals because they contribute to the economy. His comments caused a storm on social media with some criticising him and others supporting him. Qed.
