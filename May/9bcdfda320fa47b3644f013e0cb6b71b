Gaborone – Botswana’s President, Mokgweetsi Masisi, on Thursday pledged to prioritise job creation and better pay. Masisi made the remarks when addressing a celebration marking the
International Labour Day in Francistown, Botswana’s second largest city. “The government is targeting and prioritising job creation through
several strategies, chief amongst them, being relentless efforts to
attract foreign direct investors,’’ said Masisi. The president also said that his government will create an enabling
environment for investors to set up businesses in the southern African
country. With the unemployment rate estimated to be as high as 21 per cent,
fighting unemployment has been at the centre of Masisi’s development
roadmap since he assumed office. “My government is also committed to intensifying skills development
in order to enhance the employability of trainees and promoting
harmonious labour relations,’’ he said. He added that Botswana has adopted measures that will contribute to the diversification of the economy.
