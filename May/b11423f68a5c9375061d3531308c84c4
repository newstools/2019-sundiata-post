Guiyang,  (China) – A senior Communist Party of China (CPC) official has stressed the role of lawmakers in the country’s fight against poverty. Wang Chen, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice chairman of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, made the call during his visit to Guizhou Province from May 23 to 26. Wang said lawmakers at all levels must take up their responsibility to help the country win the battle against poverty. “Lawmakers should improve legislative proposals, actively take part in poverty relief activities, and better serve the people through platforms like the deputy’s liaison office,” he said. Wang also urged lawmakers to step up legislative supervision to help solve issues people are most concerned about in the anti-poverty campaign. (Xinhua/NAN)
