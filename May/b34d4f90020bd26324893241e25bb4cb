(CNN) — It’s a feeling of extreme work stress that’s long been embedded in the cultural lexicon, and now it might be codified in your medical records as well. Burnout is now a legitimate medical diagnosis, according to the International Classification of Diseases, or the ICD-11, the World Health Organization’s handbook that guides medical providers in diagnosing diseases. Burnout now appears in the ICD-11’s section on problems related to employment or unemployment. According to the handbook, doctors can diagnose someone with burnout if they meet the following symptoms: One reason for that, the Heinemanns argue, is that much of the research on burnout focused on “causes and associated factors,” rather than on attempts to develop specific diagnostic criteria. That led to “vagueness and ambiguity” around the concept of burnout. In their review, they note that the question of whether researchers could differentiate depression and burnout was also a major obstacle in elevating burnout to a disease. Source: CNN
