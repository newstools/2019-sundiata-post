She said that in the course of her visit, she would be meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Women and Social Development to discuss strengthening bilateral ties. “It is an honor to meet ministers and the President and strengthen the relationships between Nigeria and the United Nations. “Basically, we are going to discuss the main challenges of Nigeria and the need to address the issues of Peace and security together with the challenges of development and environmental protection. “I think that Nigeria has shown a great example and leadership in putting together these factors; climate change, environmental protection, peace and security. “When I was elected President of the General Assembly, I promised to pay special attention to Africa and this is my second visit to Africa and I hope more will continue before I leave. “Africa is at the forefront of the future of development and my presence here has shown how much Africa is important to the United Nations,” Espinosa said.
